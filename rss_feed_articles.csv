"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Iain Macneil MNM and Kat Heathcote Macneil MBE return to their roots with the announcement of a new CBT Joint Venture initially focussing on the burgeoning Maritime Security Sector. Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Great Lakes Announces the Delivery of its Newest Hopper Dredge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/great-lakes-announces-the-delivery-of-its-newest-hopper-dredge,,22/08/2025 18:43:30,,"[By Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp.] Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (""Great Lakes"" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GLDD), the largest provider of dredging services in the United States, today announced it took delivery of its newest Jones Act-compliant hopper dredge, the Amelia Island from the Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, Louisiana.

MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Mano Cruises Crown Iris was forced to skip ports and has also reported delays as protestors vented their anger over the war during the ship’s port visits.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
China Coast Guard Up-Guns its Presence at Scarborough Shoal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-coast-guard-up-guns-its-presence-at-scarborough-shoal,,22/08/2025 01:09:58,,"The China Coast Guard has up-gunned its patrol forces at Scarborough Shoal after a series of high-profile security developments at the reef, including an embarrassing collision between a Chinese PLA Navy warship and a China Coast Guard cutter earlier this month. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Hurricane Erin Creates Risk for Shipping off U.S. East Coast,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hurricane-erin-creates-risk-for-shipping-off-u-s-east-coast,,21/08/2025 03:50:54,,"The outer bands of Hurricane Erin have reached the coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic states, bringing risks to shipping and to the general public in beachfront communities. Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines.

In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre.

We look forward to sharing our vision and meeting with global maritime and logistics leaders during this innovative conference and exhibition” he added. Bahri's commitment to excellence is evidenced by its recent significant investments in fleet expansion. In August 2024, the company secured a landmark $1 billion deal to acquire nine Very Large Crude-oil Carriers (VLCCs) from Capital Marine and Trading Cooperation, reinforcing its position as one of the largest VLCC operators worldwide. This acquisition was part of a broader fleet modernization initiative that sees Bahri operate an impressive fleet of 103 owned vessels, and three floating desalination barges. Bahri's strategic vision extends beyond fleet expansion to include the development of a comprehensive maritime ecosystem within Saudi Arabia. The company has formed strategic partnerships with key national entities to strengthen the Kingdom's maritime capabilities including: a strategic Letter of Intent with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma'aden) to explore collaboration opportunities for localizing maritime industries and developing resilient supply chains; partnership with the Saudi Logistics Academy to enhance employment opportunities and skills development in the maritime logistics sector, and expansion of Bahri Ship Management's service portfolio to provide technical ship management and crewing services to other maritime operators. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey toward becoming a global maritime cluster under Vision 2030, Bahri stands at the helm, navigating the Kingdom toward a prosperous and sustainable maritime future on the world stage. This year’s Saudi Maritime Logistics Congress is organised by Seatrade Maritime, part of Informa Markets and with Founding Strategic Partner, Bahri, alongside Main Partners, Mawani, and TGA. According to Chris Morley, Group Director, Seatrade Maritime, “The maritime industry represents a crucial component of Saudi Arabia's ""blue economy"" strategy, which recognizes the potential for significant returns on maritime investments as part of the broader economic transformation agenda. Our objective is to showcase the phenomenal opportunities available through collaborations with both national and international companies, as well as deep dive into the multiple ongoing projects. The conference agenda will spotlight investment, innovation and sustainability amongst other key topics and bring together over 100 regional and international experts.” “Our ultimate aim is to facilitate fruitful cooperation between the public and private sector entities that catalyses growth for our industry.” Morley concluded. The two-day event includes both an international exhibition and a detailed conference programme spread across two stages with multiple free-to-attend sessions. The sixth edition in the annual cycle follows on from a record-breaking 2024 which saw more than 10,000 visitors converge on Dhahran Expo to do business and gain up-to-date knowledge from industry specialists.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa. Russia also struck the oil refining and gas transportation infrastructure in the Poltava region in central Ukraine.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas. Leading by Example “Port Tampa Bay believes nature and industry can coexist,” said Paul Anderson, Port Tampa Bay President & CEO. “Our partnership with DarkSky illustrates our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. We’re proud to help pioneer this important program and guide the maritime industry toward more sustainable practices.” Throughout 2024, DarkSky and Port Tampa Bay engaged lighting designers, marine infrastructure experts, and environmental advocates to ensure the program meets both operational needs and ecological goals. The resulting guidelines are now available for adoption by other ports and marine facilities worldwide.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Towboat Hits Bridge On Colombia's Magdalena River,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towboat-hits-bridge-over-colombia-s-magdalena-river,,20/08/2025 00:00:08,,"On Sunday morning, a large towboat hit a bridge over the Magdalena River at Barrancabermeja, a refinery town about 160 miles north of Bogota, Colombia. At about 0615 hours, the towing vessel Ciudad de Medellin was operating near the Guillermo Gaviria Bridge, upriver from the Ecopetrol refinery. The river was rising due to heavy rains, and video from the scene shows that the current was running strong. While attempting a turn, the towboat had a hard allision with a bridge pier, resulting in extensive damage to the vessel. The top of the pilothouse was cut off as the towboat passed under the bridge. No injuries were reported, and good Samaritans arrived swiftly to help the crew. Video footage from the immediate aftermath suggests that the towboat took on water and listed to starboard after the casualty. The vessel partially sank by the stern by the time salvors arrived.

The towboat appears to have been outside of the navigation channel, according to local fishermen; the causes are under investigation. The operating company is arranging for a salvage operation to remove the wreckage and ensure safety of navigation. Ciudad de Medellin is a 2,000-horsepower towboat operated by Naviera Rio Grande.

Bulk of Oil Removed During Salvage of MSC Baltic III in Canada,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulk-of-oil-removed-during-salvage-of-msc-baltic-iii-in-canada,,19/08/2025 23:26:04,,"The Canadian Coast Guard signaled a milestone in the ongoing salvage operation for the MSC Baltic III, which grounded five months ago during a fierce winter storm off Newfoundland, Canada. After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

When Atlantic Treasure started taking on water overnight Sunday, the crew of the nearby fishing vessel Maid Of Amsterdam answered their mayday call and brought them to safety within hours. The Atlantic Treasure was under way on a fishing trip to the Grand Banks over the weekend. Late Sunday, the vessel suddenly began taking on water at a fast rate - possibly from a burst pipe, skipper Noah Deveau told CBC. Deveau had three crewmembers deploy the liferafts and gather all needed survival gear, then turned everyone else to the task of attempting to save the ship. The flooding overwhelmed the bilge pumps, and within a short period of time the Atlantic Treasure was taking water on deck. When the power to the pumps went out, Deveau had the crew abandon ship into the life raft while the deck lights were still lit. All hands made it safely aboard the raft and away from the sinking vessel. Deveau got a mayday out before abandoning ship, and Maid Of Amsterdam's skipper responded. The Amsterdam was about three hours away, headed back to port ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Erin. It diverted to meet up with the drifting raft, and in calm surface conditions, all Atlantic Treasure crewmembers transferred over safely and headed back for Nova Scotia. The timing of the rescue was fortunate: Hurricane Erin is expected to pass off the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on Saturday with winds of about 80-100 knots.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Bulker Suffers Cargo Hold Explosion in Baltimore Harbor,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulker-suffers-cargo-hold-explosion-in-baltimore-harbor,,19/08/2025 04:19:15,,"On Monday night, a major explosion and fire occurred aboard a bulker in the Port of Baltimore's inner harbor, three miles from the site of the former Francis Scott Key Bridge. At 1830 hours local time, the vessel W Sapphire (IMO 9605645) was departing the CSX Curtis Bay coal pier in laden condition. Just off the dock, the vessel sustained a massive explosion in the forward hold, followed by a fire. A web cam operated by StreamTime captured video of the event, with some of the elements of the Key Bridge visible in the background. Multiple firefighting vessels responded immediately to the scene and began response efforts. According to the Baltimore City Fire Department, no injuries were reported on board, but the vessel sustained signs of explosion and fire damage. The fire has been extinguished and plans for the vessel are still being arranged, according to the Coast Guard. The captain of the port has established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the vessel. The cause of the blast is under investigation. Coal cargoes have known fire and explosion risks related to methane emissions, with the degree of risk varying by type of coal and the ventilation of the hold. The incident may resurface longstanding concerns about health and safety in fenceline communities around the 140-year-old coal pier. In a study published last month, researchers from Johns Hopkins found that ""the coal terminal is a significant driver of air pollution burdens"" in the Curtis Bay community. An on-terminal explosion occurred in 2021, caused by ""a localized build up of methane within the conveyor belt tunnel used to load coal to ships,"" according to the operator. The blast resulted in an airborne coal dust release, neighborhood complaints, a temporary shutdown and a $1.75 million settlement agreement. The coal pier is one of CSX's largest, and the rail company says that it is economically vital. ""It's important for both the global economy by ensuring coal reaches the market, and for our customers and the health of their business,"" said John Healy, CSX director of sales for export coal, in a statement last year.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Sir Anish Kapoor Designs Offshore Sector's First Public Art Installation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/sir-anish-kapoor-designs-offshore-sector-s-first-public-art-installation,,19/08/2025 03:59:56,,"Working with Greenpeace UK, sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor CBE has completed an unauthorized and potentially illegal modern art installation at a platform in the North Sea. It may be the first piece of ""fine art"" - designed and conceived by a figure from the modern art world - ever to debut aboard an offshore oil and gas structure, Greenpeace said in a statement. Kapoor, known best for public installations like ""The Bean"" on the Chicago waterfront and the ""Orbit"" sculptural tower in London, has a background in stainless steel and structural steel artworks, so the choice of a steel offshore platform is within keeping for his work. For the debut of this piece, Kapoor selected the Skiff wellhead platform, an outlying facility at the Brigantine gas field cluster. The platform is located in the North Sea about 60 nautical miles northeast of Bacton, a town on Britain's Norfolk coast. Without authorization from facility owner Shell, Greenpeace UK mobilized a climb team, a large canvas, and a 40-foot-tall ""frame"" of aluminum tubing to the Skiff site. In foggy but calm summer weather, the team boarded the platform from a RIB, assembled the frame and stretched the canvas across it. Then they hoisted a high-pressure hose to the top and sprayed about 250 gallons of food-based nontoxic dye onto the fabric, completing Kapoor's design.

Drunken Yacht Skipper Arrested Twice for Endangering Shipping in Rostock,https://maritime-executive.com/article/drunken-yacht-skipper-arrested-twice-for-endangering-shipping-in-rostock,,19/08/2025 02:39:57,,"Last week, a local yacht skipper landed in trouble with police in Rostock for drunk boating and endangering marine traffic - twice. On Wednesday, the skipper ran his eight-meter sailboat into a pier in Rostock's harbor. The pier happened to be near a turning point for ferry traffic, and the casualty - while minor in itself - forced the ferry Skane to halt a planned turn, according to VesselTracker. For any merchant vessel, this can become a dangerous situation: if an unexpected obstacle forces the pilot and master to deviate from the passage plan, the other alternatives may be less than ideal. The yacht sustained minor damage in the allision with the pier, but no water ingress. The state water police administered a breathalyzer test to the skipper upon responding to the scene. The 54-year-old man had a blood alcohol level of about 0.3 percent (BAC), consistent with severe intoxication, and the police filed charges against him for endangering shipping. While that investigation got under way, the man was released and allowed to return to his yacht. Two days later, his boat was spotted adrift in Dierkow Bay, headed for shore and apparently not under command. According to local outlet Focus, good Samaritans woke the man up by shouting and helped to secure the boat. Once again, police administered a breathalyzer test, and this time the skipper's blood alcohol level measured about 0.1 percent (BAC) - lower than before, but still well in excess of Germany's drunk-driving limits for motor vehicles. The run-in earned the man a second charge of endangering shipping traffic.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Protesters Block Asbestos-Removal Project for Classic Ferry at Brodosplit,https://maritime-executive.com/article/protesters-block-asbestos-removal-project-for-classic-ferry-at-brodosplit,,19/08/2025 01:55:28,,"Brodosplit Shipyard has landed in hot water with local residents over plans for restoring an aging cruise ship, the Moby Drea. The vessel has asbestos partition panels inside, and the shipyard's work plan called for removing them - but local citizens were not interested in the perceived risks, and pressed successfully for a government order for the ship's removal. Moby Drea (ex names Tor Britannia, Prince of Scandinavia) is a 1975-built cruise ferry, originally designed with fine lines and high speeds in mind. In service in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, the vessel made up to 27 knots with four Pielstick diesels. A 1998 refit added more steel amidships, increasing bed capacity, broadening the beam by about 10 feet and raising gross tonnage by about 6,000 GT. The cruise ferry is now 50 years old, well past the age for demolition for most commercial vessels. As recently as May, the ship was reported sold for delivery to Aliaga, Turkey for scrap value. However, on July 22, Croatian shipyard Brodosplit announced that it would be accepting Moby Drea into its facility for specialized asbestos removal work. Two days later, Shipping Italy confirmed that the vessel will be cleaned of asbestos, then moved to Piraeus for a refit for continued commercial service. The new owner is reportedly a bunkering company based in Messina, Med Fuel. The Moby Drea's interior contains metal partition panels with an asbestos core, amounting to about 350 tonnes of asbestos in total; the work will be performed by a contractor focused on this specific line of work, with special post-removal handling to minimize risk of environmental contamination. The ship arrived at Brodosplit under tow in late July, and its berthing was approved by local port authorities. But the project immediately met a speed bump: a citizens initiative to halt the work. The group organized protests outside the shipyard's gates in an attempt to prevent work from going forward, and it filed a petition with Croatia's government to demand the ship's removal, questioning whether the Moby Drea is undergoing repair or has another ultimate fate. For its part, Brodosplit said that the asbestos was fully encased in the panels and would be handled and disposed of safely. Air testing on board the ship was carried out and detected no sign of contamination before the start of work, the firm said in a statement to local media. Local sensitivities are high because of the region's history. Vranjic, a small town near Split, was once the site of a large asbestos construction material factory; the area has considerable experience with the dangers, including hundreds of fatalities over the decades. The public memory of trouble with asbestos is still alive and well, and - any statistical risk profile for the specifics of the Moby Drea project aside - protesters have expressed a strong desire to avoid returning to those days. Croatia's Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure has sided with residents and issued an order for the vessel's prompt removal from Brodosplit. The Moby Drea must be towed out of Croatia and its territorial seas by early September. Owner Med Fuel confirmed that on receipt of the stop work order on August 11, all construction activity was suspended, and none of the asbestos panels will be removed going forward. The owner is now solely focused on securing a safe tow to get Moby Drea out of Croatia, and the ministry has granted it an additional 15 days to complete the task. Split's port authority is assigned to oversee compliance. Top image: Moby Drea (Lucarelli / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Data Sector Consolidation for Shippers as Xeneta Buys eeSea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/data-sector-consolidation-for-shippers-as-xeneta-buys-eesea,,19/08/2025 01:05:47,,"The consolidation of the maritime data sector is continuing with freight and data logistics company Xeneta buying maritime and supply chain intelligence company eeSea. The move reflects the increasing sophistication of the shipping sector as companies increasingly use data to manage rapidly shifting markets. By adding eeSea’s market-leading global schedule, transit time, and reliability data to their existing range of freight rate data, Xeneta says it will enable BCO Procurement teams to manage freight contracts and suppliers based on service levels, and not just cost. They said to customers that it will help them to get the right service at the right price, no matter what the market conditions. “Coming together with eeSea, and combining our data and skills, furthers our shared mission to bring transparency and efficiency to how ocean freight is bought and sold,” said Patrik Berglund, Xeneta CEO. He said they would be able to provide customers with more actionable intelligence to control freight spend, as well as delivery reliability. Founded in 2012, Xeneta rose to prominence in the shipping community with its freight rate benchmarking and market analytics platform. More recently, it has increased its market analytics including adding well-known analyst and commentator Peter Sand to the team. It points to increasing challenges for shippers who need visibility on freight rates, contracts, and delays. It points to recent factors ranging from tariffs to wars, geopolitical challenges, and carriers' response with blank sailings and increased transshipment, as well as factors such as port congestion, all challenging shippers. “A true partnership between carriers and cargo owners relies not only on the freight rates paid, but also on the operational performance provided by the carrier, such as transit times, reliability, canceled sailings, weekly stability, and schedule forecasting accuracy,” says eeSea founder and CEO Simon Sundboell. eeSea was started a decade ago and has built its services focused on maritime and supply chain intelligence.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
The Launch of a Pure Battery-Powered EV Harbor Tugboat Development Project,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-launch-of-a-pure-battery-powered-ev-harbor-tugboat-development-project,,19/08/2025 00:56:27,,"[By: Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd.] Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Yokohama; President & CEO: Hiroyuki Saito, hereinafter “Tokyo Kisen”) and Marindows Inc. (Head Office: Tokyo; CEO: Yasumasa Suetsugu, hereinafter “Marindows”) have officially launched Japan’s first pure battery-powered EV harbor tugboat development project. This EV harbor tugboat which will be operated in the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki is aiming to contribute to “zero GHG emissions from the ports” in accordance with the Carbon Neutral Port (CNP) policy. In January 2023, Tokyo Kisen put into service “TAIGA” which was the Japan’s first series-hybrid electric-powered tugboat equipped with a large-capacity 2,486 kWh battery. Building on two and a half years of operating experience with electric-powered tugs, this project advances to the next stage—enabling truly zero-emission (zero CO?) operations—by developing and constructing a pure battery-powered EV tugboat. This could be possible by the combination of a large-capacity onboard battery system (6.66 MWh) and MW-class fast chargers. Project and Vessel Overview Planned Schedule 2025: Detailed feasibility study and concept design. (Final construction decision will be made based on the results of the detailed FS including the concept design.) 2026: Basic design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2027: Detailed design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2028: Construction starts of the vessel and fast-charging pier works. 2030: Commercial service starts at the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Seaspan and CSSC Complete Big Order Chinese-Financed in Local Currency,https://maritime-executive.com/article/seaspan-and-cssc-complete-big-order-chinese-financed-in-local-currency,,19/08/2025 00:23:32,,"Seaspan became the latest to jump into containership newbuilding, placing another big order with China State Shipbuilding. In addition to the size of the order, estimated by analysts at more than $1.2 billion, it is drawing attention as it is Chinese-financed and will be denominated in the Chinese currency, renminbi, extending China’s efforts to break free from linking newbuilds to the U.S. financial markets. As the largest independent containership leasing company, Seaspan rivals the largest carriers. It currently reports a capacity for its owned fleet of approximately 2.4 million TEU, which rivals Hapag-Lloyd as the first largest carrier by capacity. However, Seaspan’s fleet operates mostly on long-term charters to the major carriers. The company reports a fleet of 227 vessels (fully delivered, including current construction orders) and a 99 percent utilization rate. The new order is for a dozen 9,000 TEU ships to be financed by ICBC Financial Leasing. During the signing ceremony on August 15 at CSSC’s Hudong-Zhonghau Shipbuilding subsidiary, they highlighted the deal as a “prime example of the integrated development of “Made in China + China Financed,” which is a not-so-veiled response to the U.S.’s efforts to impose port fees on Chinese-built or operated vessels. CSSC hailed the order as “creating a new model for international ship trading.” There was no indication of which of Seaspan’s major customers will be the operator of the new ships, which are due for delivery by 2029. They said the ships will be conventionally fueled but have a mature linear design, an efficient powertrain, and a refined layout to maximize cargo space. Seaspan has grown rapidly and continues its pace since being taken private in an investor-led deal with management and participation by Ocean Shipping Network (ONE). In May, it was linked to a letter of intent for six 11,400 TEU vessels for COASCO. It is also reported to be building six methanol-ready 8,300 TEU vessels for COSCO.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Video: American SailGP Boat Suffers High-Speed Collision,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-american-sailgp-boat-suffers-high-speed-collision,,18/08/2025 23:08:53,,"America’s boat in the Rolex SailGP Grand Prix Season 25 event taking place in Sassnitz, Germany, over the weekend, suffered a catastrophic collision with its British rival. The boats were closing, each travelling at over 40 mph in heavy winds, when the collision occurred and caused significant damage. The American boat, which was sailing on port and therefore did not have priority, had its front hull sliced off by the rudder of the British boat. Luckily, and by the narrowest of margins, there were no casualties. In the spirit of the competition, the British boat was repaired overnight and sailed the next day with material salvaged from the American boat. The U.S. boat is owned by a group of high-profile sports star investors, chaired by founding Uber engineer Ryan McKillen. Damage after the high-speed collision (SailGP) Boats representing 12 countries are competing in a racing series that, like Formula 1 car racing, travels the world. The competition was founded by Russell Coutts and Larry Ellison in 2018. Events in the 2025 season have already taken place in Dubai, Auckland, Sydney, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Portsmouth, and Sassnitz, with races still to come in St Tropez, Geneva, Cadiz, and the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The F50 catamarans regularly reach speeds of over 60 mph when up on hydrofoils, with racecourses optimized for spectators viewing the racing on land. Each team competes with an identical boat, meaning that results are based on the skill of the crews and tactics adopted. The hydrofoils and rudders used on the boats are made of higher modulus carbon fiber, the strength of which was evident in the collision between the two boats last weekend. The hydrofoils are designed to delay the onset of cavitation, when air bubbles create friction and drag resistance. Crashes and capsizes are rare, but are high-impact events when they occur because of the speeds involved. Halfway through the 2025 series, Australia, New Zealand, and Spain are in the top three places, with the American boat falling out of contention, having started the weekend’s sailing at Sassnitz strongly.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Wan Hai 503 Remains at Sea 10 Weeks Seeking Port of Refuge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wan-hai-503-remains-at-sea-10-weeks-seeking-port-of-refuge,,18/08/2025 22:43:44,,"Ten weeks after the fire was reported aboard the containership Wan Hai 503, the vessel remains at sea in search of a port of refuge. It has turned into the vessel no one wants, as India almost immediately said it would not permit its ports to receive the ship, and more recently, Sri Lanka declined the application made for the vessel’s refuge. Owner/operator Wan Hai Lines issued its most recent update at the end of last week, reporting the vessel is stable and being monitored. “We, in close coordination with our appointed experts and the salvage team, are in the process of liaising with potential ports of refuge,” reported Wan Hai. “Decisions on the final port of refuge will take into account the overall suitability for the vessel as well as the handling of fire-damaged cargo.” The fire began on June 9 while the vessel was in India’s EEZ as it was sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Nhava Sheva, India. The Indian Coast Guard responded, assisting in the evacuation of the crew and an extensive firefighting effort. After salvage teams got secure tow lines, India, however, ordered the ship taken further out to sea, fearing a repeat of incidents such as the loss of X-Press Pearl and the ongoing problems after the MSC Elsa 3 sank weeks before the Wan Hai fire. As of July 24, India reported the vessel was outside its zone and that it was relinquishing involvement to the Maritime & Ports Authority of Singapore as the vessel’s flag state. Conditions aboard the vessel had dramatically improved with no more flames and only residual smoke in bays 29 to 35. Twenty salvers were reported aboard the ship, continuing cooling efforts and undertaking dewatering efforts. Conditions aboard as of mid-July (DGS) Wan Hai has continually reported since the end of July that the fire is extinguished and that teams continue to improve the onboard situation. However, Hapag-Lloyd, which shared cargo aboard the ship, confirmed on August 13, “The request for a port of refuge in Sri Lanka has been declined by the authorities.” They said the ship was 130 nautical miles from the Indian coast (Cape Comorin). The plan was to move it further out to sea while discussions continued on a port of refuge. This has continued, although the area is subjected to monsoons at this time of year. There is no clear determination for the direction of the ship and a potential resolution. It has been suggested it might be towed to the Middle East. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which suffered a container fire off the Indian coast, ended up gaining refuge at Khor Fakkan, in the UAE, in September 2024, about seven weeks after its fire started. That vessel, also, was not a constructive loss and returned to service. Similar salvage efforts to what are required for the Wan Hai 503 were recently completed in the Port of Aberdeen, Scotland, after the Solong was towed there after the collision and fire in the North Sea. The hulk was cleared of its debris in Scotland and arrived last week at a recycling facility in Belgium. Although a lot has been incinerated during the fire on the Wan Hai 503, the concerns raised continue to be about potential pollutants and the danger of the ship sinking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Lost and Found: Navy Yard Logbook From the Pearl Harbor Attack,https://maritime-executive.com/article/lost-and-found-navy-yard-logbook-from-the-pearl-harbor-attack,,18/08/2025 22:32:10,,"By miraculous coincidence, conservators at the U.S. National Archives have recovered the logbook for Pearl Harbor Naval Base for the period before and after the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. It is the only record of its kind from the ""date which will live infamy,"" and it was nearly lost to a trash bin before finding its way into private hands, according to the previous owners. The logbook covers the status of vessels in the yard during the period from March 1941 to June 1942, a period of extremely rapid and momentous events. During the time period when the first entries, the U.S. was on a peacetime footing and was in diplomatic talks with Japan; nine months later, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entered the war; and by the end of the logbook, just seven months further on, the U.S. Navy won strategic victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, and was gearing up to retake the Solomon Islands. The log nearly didn't make it. According to Michael William Bonds, who inherited it from his mother Oretta Kanady, the recordbook somehow ended up at Norton Air Force Base in California, where Kanady worked as a civilian employee in the 1970s. Bonds told the Washington Post that Kanady found the logbook in a trash bin and asked if she could take it home. It wasn't classified, and she received permission. Bonds took possession of it when she passed in 2000, and has had it in storage ever since. Only recently did he realize what it was, and its exceptional historical value. The record documents moments of tragedy and triumph for Pacific Fleet. It notes the untimely arrival of USS Oklahoma and USS Arizona on December 5, just in time for their destruction at the hands of Japanese pilots two days later. On the page for December 7, it details the time of arrival of the first Japanese aircraft, and the time of arrival and departure of Navy warships in response to the strike (top). On the morning of December 8, as salvors dealt with the aftermath of the attack, the log noted that the capsized hull of the battleship USS Utah ""appears to be drifting out into channel,"" recommending a tug to be sent to secure the wreck. It also shows the Pearl Harbor yard's essential work in repairing Navy warships after the Japanese attack, putting cruisers and destroyers back in the fight after severe damage. Within six months, the yard had taken in and redelivered the damaged battleships Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee; cruisers Honolulu, Helena, and Raleigh; destroyers Helm and Shaw; and three auxiliaries, all fully repaired or patched up for transit for permanent repairs.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Fincantieri Sues Citing $100M in Damages from Fraudulent Fire Insulation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fincantieri-sues-citing-100m-in-damages-from-fraudulent-fire-insulation,,18/08/2025 21:40:15,,"Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri is suing the manufacturer of fire insulation panels it used in the construction of three cruise ships and eight military ships, alleging fraud and misrepresentation that it says caused over $100 million in economic damages as well as reputational harm. The shipbuilder is alleging that Paroc Group, which is owned by Owens Corning, obtained safety certificates under “false pretenses by submitting altered materials for testing,” and conspired to maintain the fraud and sell a defective product which endangered safety. Paroc Group, which was acquired by Owens Corning in 2018, launched a new line of stonewool insulation products sold as fire safety panels for marine applications. The Navis line was promoted as a lighter-weight, fire-safe marine insulation for use in steel decks and bulkheads. Fincantieri reports that it and its subcontractors selected and began using the product in 2019 for both cruise ships and military vessels that required materials meeting the Class A-60 fire integrity standard. A-60 is the highest-rated fire insulation material under the SOLAS regs and is designed to prevent the transfer of heat for a minimum of 60 minutes. It is typically used for steel bulkheads, such as with galleys or casings, to provide protection from the potential to transfer heat and fire aboard a vessel. Fincantieri reports that it relied on the certification and the repeated assurances of the supplier for the integrity of the material. In 2023, a competitor of Owens Corning Paroc reported that it tested certain of the Navis products and found that they “did not in fact meet the fire integrity standards for Class A-60 products.” The competitor lodged a complaint, and independent testing by the Danish Institute of Fire and Security Technology in April 2023 confirmed the products were not compliant. They allege in the suit that it required a deliberate effort to undermine the initial testing process leading to the certification. They further state that the fraud required manipulation of testing materials and repeated and coordinated falsification. The product was recalled in May 2023, but Fincantieri writes in the lawsuit complaint that it “did not advise or instruct that any remedial actions be taken for completed vessels in service.” The Navis line was discontinued as of May 31, 2024. Fincantieri identified that it used the product on a total of 11 ships, including the already delivered Discovery Princess, which went into service for Carnival Corporation’s Princess Cruises in March 2022, as well as two luxury cruise ships, Explora I and Explora II, under construction for MSC’s Explora Journeys. The other eight vessels, including two under construction, are military vessels. Delivery of MSC’s Explora I was postponed for 21 days due to the need to replace the defective products. Fincantieri says it also delayed the delivery of Explora II in 2024 and Carnival Corporation’s Sun Princess being built for Princess Cruises. Fincantieri says that it is incurring over $100 million in harm. It says the direct costs include to investigate, repair, and remediate affected vessels, as well as increasing construction costs. It also incurred liquidated damages and other costs resulting from delayed deliveries. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio, where Owens Corning is headquartered. The corporation, a leader in building materials, was involved in more than 20 years of litigation related to the use of asbestos in shipbuilding materials before filing for bankruptcy and settling those suits in 2000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Maersk Reports Crew Stopped Spread of Container Fire on Vessel Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-reports-crew-stopped-spread-of-container-fire-on-vessel-off-africa,,18/08/2025 20:44:41,,"The container fire, which began last week on one of Maersk’s larger boxships, Marie Maersk, is believed to have stopped spreading, as firefighting efforts are expected to intensify. The 19,000 TEU vessel remains off the coast of Africa while the company is considering a port of refuge as the first step toward determining the full extent of the damage. “This was also achieved thanks to the assistance of four assets, three tugboats and a Platform Supply Vessel,” said Maersk in its update. The company said the vessels had brought firefighting equipment to the Marie Maersk over the past days, and AIS signals show they remain in proximity to the ship. “We expect firefighting efforts to intensify further once the external firefighters can board Marie Maersk.” The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the vessel early on August 13 while they were bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and China. Maersk has said the crew remains safe with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational. The Marie Maersk was diverted towards the West African coast to get landside support as fast as possible, and because of the large number of vessels diverting around Africa, additional Maersk vessels and others have also been in the vicinity. “Due to the prevailing conditions in the respective cargo bays, we still cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on the cargo yet,” Maersk stated. The goal is to get the vessel into a port of refuge where they can offload damaged containers and complete an inspection to determine the extent of the spread of the fire, smoke, and heat. The company has not said how many containers are aboard currently, but because they are outbound from Europe, it is possible the vessel is not fully loaded or is carrying empties. Maersk reports the vessel will be diverted to a port of refuge, which is under contemplation. The goal is to get landside support as fast as possible. The challenge is also finding a port that is willing to accept the vessel and has the capabilities to handle a container fire. In the case of the Maersk Frankfurt, which caught fire off India in July 2024, after the fire was brought under control, the vessel diverted to the Middle East. Another operator, X-Press Feeders, is again highlighting that ports in Qatar, India, and Sri Lanka refused permission when its vessel X-Press Pearl was desperately seeking refuge with a leaking container that ultimately caught fire and contributed to the total loss of the vessel.

Trump Administration Orders “Stop Work” on 80% Installed Offshore Wind Farm,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-orders-stop-work-on-80-complete-offshore-wind-farm,,24/08/2025 00:38:20,,"In a surprising move on Friday, August 22, the Trump administration took action against an 80 percent installed offshore wind farm being built by Denmark’s Ørsted and a subsidiary of BlackRock. The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a “halt to ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind project on the outer continental shelf (OCS) to allow time for it to address concerns that have arisen.” Unlike previous orders, which stopped projects before construction commenced, Revolution Wind has been under construction since 2024. Ørsted reports that the project is 80 percent complete, with all its offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. Steel in the water started in May 2024, and the first turbine installation was completed in September. The company says Revolution Wind is employing hundreds of local union workers both on and offshore and that approximately two million labor union hours have been spent on the project. The shore operations are at ProvPort and Quonset in Rhode Island, and State Pier in New London, Connecticut. BOEM was vague in its reasoning, writing in the letter to Ørsted North America that it is “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interest of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas and the territorial seas.” The letter signed by Acting Director of BOEM Matthew Giacona also refers to “concerns that have arisen” during its review under the President’s Memorandum of January 20 which directed agencies to review the industry. “Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” the company said in a statement confirming it was complying and taking steps to stop offshore activities. “This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution, as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.” In its statement, the company notes the project spent more than nine years in review and is fully permitted. It received approval of its Construction and Operations Plan in November 2023. Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles south of Rhode Island and 32 miles southeast of Connecticut, with power contracts with both states. The nearest point of land is Martha’s Vineyard with the project approximately 12 miles southwest. Power was expected to start by the spring of 2026, and when the project is completed, it would generate a total of 704 MW, with 400 MW going to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut. Ørsted points out that the project is using the same turbine technology as South Fork Wind, which was completed as the first large, commercial offshore wind farm in the United States in 2024. The stop work order pertains to all offshore activities on the OCS. The company can continue any emergency or safety work, as well as onshore activities. BOEM says the project may appeal this determination. Ørsted said in its statement that it is considering “a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.” The company is 50 percent owned by the Danish state, and just announced it was facing financial challenges due to the actions of the new U.S. government. It launched a rights offering to raise $9 billion from existing shareholders, which it is said is necessary to fund the construction work for another U.S. wind farm, Sunrise Wind, as well as completing Revolution Wind, after investors determined the risks are too great in the U.S. market based on the uncertainties raised by the Trump administration’s assault on wind energy. Last year, Eversource sold its 50 percent interest in its partnership with Ørsted to Global Infrastructure Partners and its Skyborn Renewables fund. GIS was acquired last year by BlackRock to expand the group's investment in renewable energy and infrastructure, with BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, reported to be a friend and supporter of Donald Trump. This is the second time the administration has issued a stop work order on an offshore wind farm. In April, the Department of the Interior suspended licenses to Equinor just as offshore work was due to begin on the Empire Wind project off New York. The suspension lasted for a month and drew broad criticism, while there were reports of pressure, including from the Norwegian government, which owns Equinor. There were reports of a deal where New York State will permit an oil pipeline it was blocking in exchange for the lifting of the stop work order on Empire Wind. Equinor reported it would take a $1 billion impairment charge related to the impact of the U.S. actions on the project and the offshore wind industry. Last week, the Trump administration also announced a further review of the manufacture of wind turbines and their components. Trump has repeatedly said they are made in China, although none of the U.S. projects are using Chinese turbines. The Commerce Department was ordered to start a trade investigation citing national security concerns over the importing of components for wind energy projects. Experts point out that 40 percent of the components for wind energy projects come from Europe, while Mexico is supplying more than 30 percent of the material used in the construction. The Trump administration has said it will include aluminum and steel components for wind turbines in the 50 percent tariff on imports, and the new trade investigation could impose further tariffs on components. The administration has already suspended future licensing and revoked previous approvals. Trump has promised to “stop the windmills.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Coast Guard Arrests Intoxicated MSC Containership Captain After Ship Docks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/coast-guard-arrests-intoxicated-msc-containership-captain-after-ship-docks,,23/08/2025 23:26:40,,"The US Coast Guard arrested the master of a containership this week after the pilot guiding the ship to port reported the captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Chicago Propeller Club Hears Industry Cry from MARAD Acting Administrator,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chicago-propeller-club-hears-industry-cry-from-marad-acting-administrator,,24/08/2025 00:47:04,,"[By: Chicago Propeller Club] The United States has entered a new era of maritime strength, the head of the Maritime Administration told the Chicago Propeller Club’s flagship summer event at Chicago Yacht Club. In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre. And she called on everyone present to combine their efforts and make the voice of the maritime industry stronger in Washington DC. “Working together our potential is so much greater and it will strengthen our voice in Washington,” she urged. Jackie Carter the Port of Milwaukee director was also honored on the evening as she moves to a new role with the City of Milwaukee. In a look to the future, Jack Dougherty, co-founder and owner of autonomous shipping company Janus Marine and Defense underscored the need for the maritime industry to embrace new technologies, stay ahead of the competition, increase operational efficiency and job safety, and boost national security. In addition, veteran led Chicago charity No Salt Sailing made an appeal for support. The charity helps veterans and their families cope with PTSD by learning to sail on the Great Lakes.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,23/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

Le Groupe ALMACO Secures Contract to Outfit Canada’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-secures-contract-to-outfit-canada-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 03:53:57,,"[By: Le Groupe ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed a $105M Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada's premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie's shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie's skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie's facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group's Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec's role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada's broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO's role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province's advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO's Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada's Maritime Future ""Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,"" said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. ""We've maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We're not just outfitting a ship—we're helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together."" ""Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. ""Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada."" Davie is a key player in Canada's National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. ""This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada's shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,"" said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. ""The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,"" said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. ""Davie's leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,"" said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. ""The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions' naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec's position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century."" A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
HD Hyundai Buys Manufacturer as it Seeks Expansion in Vietnam Shipbuilding,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-buys-manufacturer-as-it-seeks-expansion-in-vietnam-shipbuilding,,20/08/2025 23:45:30,,"South Korea’s HD Hyundai is continuing to pursue opportunities to grow its shipbuilding business and increase its competitive position against the Chinese. It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines. Footage shows Japanese Coast Guard ships battling a fire on the USS New Orleans (LPD-18) off Okinawa. pic.twitter.com/n0FBTtwjVo The fire appears to have begun in the forward part of the vessel around 4:00 p.m. local time on August 20. Spectators reported seeing smoke coming intermittently from the forward part of the vessel or midship. Video on Japanese TV showed tugs near the forward part of the ship spraying water on the hull. The fire was reported to the Japan Coast Guard, which sent a patrol boat to determine the extent of the situation. Around 5:00 p.m. local time, the Coast Guard reports it received a request for assistance from the U.S. Navy. However, that first call was withdrawn within the hour, and the U.S. Navy was instructing vessels to stay about one mile away. The request for assistance from the Japanese was reinstated around 7:30 p.m. local time. The Navy reports that the crew of a sister ship from the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock class, USS San Diego, which was moored at White Beach Naval Facility, assisted in fighting the fire. The Japan Self-Defense Force reported its vessels were conducting firefighting efforts to aid the crew of the USS New Orleans. The Japan Coast Guard was providing assistance. As the fire progressed, they employed a total of four tugs with two on each side of the warship to cool the full. The US 7th Fleet command thanked the Japanese for their aid. The reports emphasized that there have been no requests to evacuate any of the U.S. personnel from the vessel.

External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Russian Drones Damage Tanker During Attack on Oil Terminal in Izmail,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russian-drones-damage-tanker-during-attack-on-oil-terminal-in-izmail,,20/08/2025 18:50:13,,"Russia appears to have intensified its attacks on the Ukrainian fuel logistics infrastructure with a series of attacks, including targeting the largest terminal in southern Ukraine. The Triton Oil Depot came under fierce drone attacks overnight, inflicting heavy damage and catching a tanker during its offloading operations. The product tanker Excellion (7,842 dwt) had arrived from Sulina, Romania yesterday, August 19, reporting it was fully loaded, likely with diesel fuel. Built in 2008, the vessel is registered in Panama and listed as being operated by Makoil Group of the UK and managed from Estonia. According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa.

DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas.

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels. The Coast Guard (with help from the Navy) operates in the region to interdict drug traffickers, and it has historically conducted all law enforcement boardings. USNI noted that the Iwo Jima ARG's departure was the first deployment of any fully-equipped ARG in eight months. The Navy's amphib fleet readiness is deteriorating due to advancing age and persistent maintenance delays; it currently stands at about 40 percent, an official told Military Times this week - just half of the Marine Corps' desired level of Navy transport capability.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 21:27:46

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region.

The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41

The first phase will involve developing a green vessel recycling facility; the second component will include a shipbuilding center, providing ship construction and maintenance services; and lastly, the third phase includes building oil and gas storage facilities. “With the establishment of the shipyard complex, Pahang will emerge as a regional maritime hub, providing competitive services in shipbuilding, green ship recycling and oil and gas hub,” said Wan Rosdy, Head of Pahang State. The state is also implementing a similar project in the Gebeng industrial area, the Kuantan Maritime Hub (KMH), located about 35 miles to the north of Pekan. The $500 million project is being developed by Muhibbah Engineering and is scheduled for completion in 2034. The KMH project covers a 500-acre site, with some parts reclaimed from the sea. The hub is expected to host industries ranging from commercial shipbuilding and ship repair to defense and technical training. These flagship projects are important for Malaysia to retain a long-term standing in the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s CEO, Sikh Shamsul Ibrahim. “Malaysia should always remain vigilant of rising competition from lower cost yards in neighboring economies such a Vietnam and Indonesia. We should start focusing on reducing reliance on foreign automation tools, by approaching local robotic manufacturing in Malaysia, which could build a whole new automated system integration to improve productivity in our shipbuilding landscape,” added Sikh Shamsul. As of June, the authority said it has approved shipbuilding and ship repair sector investments worth over $230 million, showing sustained interest by the private sector to invest in the Malaysian shipyard sector.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03
"To Take On a Bigger Role, Malaysia's MMEA Buys a Bigger Ship",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/to-take-on-a-bigger-role-malaysia-s-mmea-buys-a-bigger-ship,,25/08/2025 04:53:12,,"This month, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) held a keel laying ceremony for a new Multi-Purpose Mission Ship (MPMS) in Turkey. The event marked another milestone in the construction of MMEA’s largest vessel, with the steel-cutting ceremony held last month. Construction is under way at Desan Shipyard after a memorandum of understanding with MMEA back in February. The signing of the construction contract followed in May, with the vessel scheduled for delivery in 2027. The construction project also involves cooperation with other Turkish defense industry companies such as Aselsan and Havelsan. The two companies will be involved in the installation of advanced weaponry, detection and communication systems. The 99-meter-long vessel will serve deep sea operations lasting 28 days without resupply. It will have capacity for 70 crew members and additional room for 30 passengers. For surveillance and interdiction, it will be equipped with two unmanned aerial vehicles, four fast interceptor craft, a helicopter deck and detention compartments. According to MMEA, the vessel will be deployed for surveillance in Malaysia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), especially in the South China Sea. In the past few years, Malaysia’s EEZ has become a hotspot for illegal Ship-to-Ship (STS) oil transfers. This has mainly involved older ships carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, raising concerns about compliance, safety and pollution. Recently, Malaysia has introduced new regulations with an aim to curb shadow fleet STS transfers. Some of the efforts include closing the notorious Tompok Utara anchorage and layup area near the Singapore Strait. However, MMEA emphasizes that it requires enhanced operational and patrolling capabilities to curb increased criminal activities in Malaysian waters. Last year, the agency got a budgetary allocation of $159 million to procure new vessels and maintain existing ones. Almost half of this allocation - $82 million - went into the acquisition of the MPMS. Another $37 million went into the procurement of two New Generation Patrol Craft (NGPC).",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03

Video: Chilean Navy Rescues Survivor From the Rocks in Tierra Del Fuego,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-chilean-navy-rescues-survivor-from-the-rocks-in-tierra-del-fuego,,25/08/2025 05:57:42,,"Against all odds, the Chilean Navy has rescued a survivor from a fishing vessel that went missing off Tierra del Fuego on Thursday. The four fishermen aboard the vessel were harvesting sea urchins, and the crew disappeared along with their vessel, the Ana Belen. Good Samaritan fishermen located the survivor - who was wearing a black wetsuit - in an area known locally as the Bahia Sea, near the western entrance to Beagle Channel. The maze of inlets at the westward fringe of Tierra del Fuego bears the full brunt of the region's stormy weather, and this creates real challenges for shore access. The survivor could not be reached by helicopter because of powerful downdrafts from the cliffs above, and heaving surf made it impossible to get a small boat near to the rocky shoreline. To complete the retrieval of the survivor, a Chilean Navy helicopter dropped a rescue swimmer into the water near the rocks, and he swam through the waves and climbed up on shore to reach the fisherman. Then, together, they got back into the frigid water and swam out to a pickup point. ""The extraction lasted approximately 25 minutes, which was vitally important since they had to swim to the rescue boat that was waiting for them in a safe place,"" said Serio Surriba, commander of the naval aviation unit in Puerto Williams. The survivor has been identified as Juan Andrés Rojas Casco, a Paraguayan national. The search for the three other missing fishermen continues, and the Chilean Navy has pledged to make ""every effort to find the rest of the crew.""

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region. As Turkey pushes to become a regional energy hub, the Mediterranean Sea presents significant potential in achieving the ambition. Recently, Turkey bought two drillships, which will boost its exploration capacity in the Mediterranean region.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

With the help of external firefighting teams and equipment brought out to the ship while it was off Africa, Maersk has reported that the fire was contained. The company released two pictures taken on Friday, August 22, when a supply vessel reached the scene with additional firefighting equipment. There is no visible fire damage to any of the boxes aboard what appears to be a heavily laden vessel. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU. “After an inspection of affected areas of the vessel and careful consideration of all aspects together with authorities and class, it was deemed safe that Marie Maersk resumes her eastbound voyage around Cape of Good Hope on Sunday. Her next port of destination is under final review, and we will inform as soon as it has been decided,” Maersk reported. Marie Maersk with no visible fire damage to the containers aboard (Maersk) The containership had spent a week lying off the west coast of Liberia after smoke was first detected coming from containers on August 13. The ship was moved closer to the coast so that fire equipment could be brought out. Late last week, the ship rounded the western coast of Africa and was then met with additional supplies offshore near Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire). A supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment reached the Marie Maersk on Friday evening and transferred special equipment onboard on Saturday, August 23. The AIS signal for the ship shows it now underway with a declared destination of Cape Town, South Africa. Its routing called for a stop in Malaysia before proceeding to China. The company has repeated said the navigational equipment and machinery was not damaged, and the ship was stable. Maersk reports that the external firefighting team will remain on board, and “special measures” have been put in place to ensure a safe journey. An intermediate stop might be implemented, Maersk said, depending on the optimal place for handling the damaged containers and to mitigate onward disruptions in its network. Contingencies are in place in case the planned journey needs to be revised en route. The company has not advised on the location of the boxes that were smoking or the nature of the cargo. In general, mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo is one of the most frequent dangers cited for the containership. Maersk has said the full extent of the damage would not be known until the vessel reaches a port and unloads containers from the area where the fire was located.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

The reports initially placed the drones at various points around the region, with Drozdenko reporting that at least 10 drones were destroyed on Saturday, prompting him to issue a warning for citizens to “refrain from being near industrial zones and enterprises, as well as visiting public places.” On Sunday, August 24, Drozdenko acknowledged that at least 10 drones had attacked the port of Ust-Luga, although he said they were all destroyed. Debris from a drone was, however, reported to have caused a fire at the Novatek terminal. The reports said there were no casualties. The extent of the damage is unclear, and many of the photos being posted online are from a 2024 fire at the plant. Drozdenko said the fire had been “localized” and that the fuel tanks were not damaged. By Sunday afternoon, the report was that the fire at Ust-Luga had been extinguished and Novatek was starting repairs and restoration work.

Some 600 miles from Ukraine. https://t.co/948Ma4zBEz pic.twitter.com/YTlQPjaETo It is believed the gas processing equipment was struck, taking the plant offline. Some reports are suggesting it could take months to repair, which would be a major blow to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Novatek has been operating the facility, which is located about 70 miles west of St. Petersburg, since 2013. Reports are that it handles more than seven million tons of gas condensate as well as more than four million tons of heavy and light oil. It is also a supplier of marine and jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel fuel. The daring attack was staged more than 600 miles from Ukraine and was part of a larger assault on the energy system. Russia’s defense ministry is saying 95 drones were launched across 14 regions and all were downed with minor damage. It acknowledged 13 drones destroyed over Ust-Luga, as well as some damage to a nuclear power plant. Russia has been striking Ukraine’s fuel import and distribution network and facilities. Last week, a tanker was reportedly damaged while unloading at the port of Izmail on the Danube.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

Two Canadian First Nations Buy Strategic Mining Port Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/two-canadian-first-nations-buy-strategic-mining-port-terminal,,26/08/2025 03:00:06,,"In a first-of-its-kind transaction for Canada’s British Columbia Province, two First Nations have formed a partnership with a Canadian logistics company and will acquire the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal located in northwestern British Columbia along the U.S.-Canada border. It comes as there is an increasing push to tap Canada’s minerals and resources for economic advancement. ""This isn't just about us purchasing the first Indigenous majority-owned port in British Columbia's history,"" Andrew Robinson, chief executive officer of the Nisga'a Lisims Government, told The Canadian Press. “It's about economic sovereignty, reconciliation, and ensuring that wealth generated from our lands directly benefits our people and generations to come.” The Nisga’a Nation and the Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership are partnering with Arrow Transportation Systems to launch the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. The new group is also consolidating the regional trucking operations of Arrow Transport’s Stewart Trucking Division and Tahltan-Arrow Transport to provide bulk transportation and logistics solutions in the Tahltan Territory. They note that Northwest BC is home to more than half the province’s exploration and mining sector. They believe the new partnership will provide improved access to deliver critical minerals from mine to market. The Port of Stewart is Canada’s most northerly ice-free port located to the north of Prince Rupert and supplying critical access to both British Columbia and Alberta. It is 80 to 90 miles from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the Portland Canal and provides support for the logging, mining, and exploration operations in the region. “Together, we are making history,” said Kerry Carlick, President, Tahltan Central Government. “The acquisition of this strategic asset will drive economic growth, create opportunities, and strengthen our nations’ self-determination.” The terminal primarily handles ore and logging with a breakbulk wharf and RoRo capabilities for barges. It can accommodate vessels up to approximately 50,000 dwt for the transport of ore and logs. One of the key customers is Newmont, which operates the Brucejacket and Red Chris mines in the indigenous communities’ territories and transports copper concentrate to market from the port. Newmont is strengthening its ties with the First Nations to support long-term growth of the port as a regional hub and provide the port’s new owners commercial certainty needed to move forward with the investments. The Province of British Columbia has also provided a C$5 million (US$3.6 million) grant to the two First Nations to support the purchase of the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. It is part of the government’s Northwest Strategy to support mining development and the indigenous peoples.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Master Boat Builders Expands Shipbuilding Operations,https://maritime-executive.com/article/master-boat-builders-expands-shipbuilding-operations,,26/08/2025 02:08:19,,"[By Master Boat Builders] Master Boat Builders, Inc. (Master Boat), an internationally recognized vessel and workboat manufacturer, today announced that it has invested $7.8 million to modernize and expand its shipbuilding operations in Mobile County by adding a new fabrication shop and floating drydock. The expansion project creates 85 new jobs, adding to Master Boat’s skilled workforce of more than 300 workers and further contributes to Mobile County’s strength in shipbuilding and maritime services. “This investment is about more than just expanding our ability to build more high-quality vessels. It underscores our commitment to increasing American shipbuilding capacity and we’re doing it right here along America’s Gulf Coast in Mobile County,” said Garrett Rice, President of Master Boat Builders. “By modernizing our facilities and growing our skilled workforce, we’re positioning our team to deliver critical vessels that support U.S. commerce and industry, all while training the next generation of American shipbuilders.” “Mobile’s maritime industry continues to thrive, and Master Boat’s investment underscores our region’s leadership in shipbuilding,” said Bradley Byrne, Mobile Chamber president and CEO. “By creating new jobs, retaining existing ones and investing in workforce development, this project is a powerful example of how our business community is growing alongside our thriving port and maritime economy.” The expansion includes the construction of a new fabrication building, a floating dry dock to support new harbor tug contracts, workforce training initiatives and infrastructure improvements. “Master Boat Builders is a 45-year-old, third generation, locally owned shipbuilder located in the Bayou. They have employed thousands of people over that span from local communities and currently employ over 300 people. If we can’t incentivize and support the growth of a business like Master, we shouldn’t be incentivizing anyone!” said District 3 Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt. “This expansion not only secures and creates jobs for local families, but it also reinforces the fact that Mobile County is a leader in shipbuilding and maritime innovation and will be for years to come.” This project also supports the region’s ongoing workforce development and training initiatives, reflecting the growing demand for skilled talent within the maritime and shipbuilding sectors. “Master Boat’s expansion highlights the continued momentum of Alabama’s maritime industry and reinforces Mobile County’s position as a hub for shipbuilding and repair,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “This investment not only creates quality jobs but also strengthens the region’s capacity to support a vital sector of our state’s economy.” Work on this expansion began October of 2024 and is expected to be fully operational by October of this year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Mediterranean NGO Reports Libya Shot and Damaged its Rescue Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mediterranean-ngo-reports-libya-shot-and-damaged-its-rescue-boat,,26/08/2025 01:59:48,,"The NGO SOS Mediterranee released details on an encounter in the Mediterranean on Sunday, August 24, in which it says the Libyan Coast Guard opened fire on its ship and continued to attack the ship for up to 20 minutes. The group released pictures showing shattered bridge windows among other damage, which it reports the Libyans inflicted on the small rescue boat Ocean Viking. SOS Mediterranee has been operating the Ocean Viking, a former North Sea supply vessel for the oil and gas industry, since 2019 under charter from the International Red Cross. Built in 1986 and now registered in Norway, the ship was outfitted with three rigid rescue boats and a medical facility. The group reports it made two rescues on August 23, taking aboard 47 people, including nine unaccompanied minors, who it says are mostly from war-torn Somalia. The Italians had ordered the Ocean Viking to head to Marina di Carrara, a 700 nautical mile trip that would have required 3.5 days, but they received permission to remain in the Mediterranean searching for a third boat with migrants. The Ocean Viking, they report, was 40 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast when they were confronted by a patrol boat on Sunday afternoon. According to their account of the situation, the Libyans first demanded that the vessel leave the area and head north immediately. They said the instructions were radioed in English and Arabic. Today at 3pm, the #OceanViking has been deliberately and violently attacked in intl. waters by the Libyan Coast Guard, who fired hundreds of shots at our ship. The 87 survivors and crew on board were not wounded. We are currently working on a detailed reconstruction of events. pic.twitter.com/i8RkuYI1ep Without warning or an ultimatum, SOS Mediterranee reports that two soldiers aboard the Libyan boat began shooting at the Ocean Viking. They are claiming the patrol boat circled the vessel, shooting for up to 20 minutes. Four windows on the bridge were broken, multiple antennas were destroyed, and several bullets struck and damaged the three fast rescue boats, along with other equipment. None of the migrants or crew were injured. The Ocean Viking issued a mayday and called NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian. They report that they were told an Italian navy ship was the closest NATO asset, but it did not return calls. The captain of the Ocean Viking started his vessel for Syracuse, Italy, but the authorities later ordered them to sail to Augusta. SOS Mediterranee is demanding a full investigation into the incident. It is also pointing out that the vessel that attacked them was one of two patrol boats Italy gifted to Libya in June 2023. There have been similar incidents in the past with the Libyan Coast Guard and the rescue vessels. This one, however, was more aggressive and longer. The group says its volunteers and the survivors were clearly threatened and felt in serious danger.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
U.S. Coast Guard Sets Record With 34-Tonne Cocaine Offload,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-sets-record-with-34-tonne-cocaine-offload,,26/08/2025 01:48:45,,"The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Hamilton has offloaded a record-setting 34 tonnes of cocaine at the pier in Port Everglades, a quantity of the drug rarely seen in one place. It is the service's largest single cocaine offload on record, and the Coast Guard estimated its value at a (much-reduced) price of just $470 million. An overabundance of South American cocaine exports have pushed down prices in export markets, increasing volume and reducing its value at the same time. USCGC Hamilton offloaded cocaine collected in 19 separate interdictions near Aruba, Haiti, Venezuela, Curacao, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Bonaire, and a variety of high-seas locations in the Eastern Pacific, from Ecuador to Mexico. Six different Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy vessels participated in the seizures, but Hamilton played the largest role, conducting 11 interdictions and seizing a record 47,000 pounds of cocaine. Cocaine bust off Bonaire, facilitated by destroyer USS Cole (USCG) “Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,” said Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer of Hamilton. “The commitment and sacrifice of our deployed service members and their families, who forego time together for the protection of our Nation, are to be celebrated.” A large share of the cocaine traffic through the Caribbean is destined for Europe, not the United States. European customers account for about one fifth of global cocaine demand, and have historically paid a premium for the drug. The Coast Guard priced out the shipment's U.S. wholesale value at about $14,000 per kilo, a fraction of the 2024 EU average of about $35,000 per kilo; EU street and wholesale prices have fallen since the first quarter of 2025, according to multiple European media reports, driven down by an abundant supply and a price war between cartels.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Zim Confirms Turkey’s Immediate Ban on Shipping Associated with Israel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/zim-confirms-turkey-s-immediate-ban-on-shipping-associated-with-israel,,26/08/2025 00:58:53,,"Zim confirmed the earlier reports that Turkey has begun turning away ships associated with Israel. The company, which is the ninth-largest container carrier, reports it is rerouting ships scheduled to call at Turkish ports and working on a mitigation plan. In a stock exchange filing on Monday, August 25, Zim writes, “It received a notice from the Turkish Port Authorities through the company’s local agent in Turkey, that as a result of a new regulation adopted in Turkey, vessels that are either owned, managed or operated by an entity related to Israel will not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports.” The change was said to be effective immediately as of last Friday. The Globes newspaper in Israel reports that one of the company’s ships was turned away from Istanbul last Friday. It writes that the vessel was forced to proceed to Piraeus, Greece, and that there is no clear solution for the cargo scheduled to be loaded or unloaded in Istanbul. The new regulation also impacts all vessels that are carrying military cargo destined to Israel, which Zim says it was told would not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports. Also, Turkish-flagged vessels are prohibited from calling at Israeli ports. Globes reports that while it is an expansion of the trade embargo Turkey imposed 15 months ago, it says shipping companies are still waiting for clear instructions from the Turkish government. It says other major carriers, such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, are seeking clear instructions. A ship’s flag is said not to be a guarantee that it will be permitted into a Turkish port. It is not the first country to bar Israeli shipping, for example, Malaysia took a similar step in December 2023, but it is a minor trading partner with Israel. Turkey and Israel had a large trade flow, and even after the embargo, trade continued between the countries. The ban comes as Zim has already been under pressure. Last week, the company reported a 15 percent decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2025 and a 38 percent decline in earnings (EBITDA) for the quarter. Carried container volume was down six percent in the second quarter to 895,000 TEU, but box volume for the six months was up year-over-year to 1.84 million TEU. Management cited the company’s agility and ability to respond to the challenging market conditions. Based on its outlook, it raised its midpoint guidance for the full year 2025 despite the softness in the quarter. Today, it however, warned that if Turkey’s ban remains unchanged, it is expected to negatively impact financial and operating results. Recently, there have been market rumors that management was exploring a possible buyout of Zim with an investment group. Zim went public in January 2021 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
NTSB: Barge Grounded in Prince William Sound After ATB's Lines Parted,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-barge-grounded-in-prince-william-sound-because-atb-s-lines-parted,,26/08/2025 00:41:25,,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the results of its investigation into the loss of the barge Cordova Provider, which ran aground in Prince William Sound and suffered so much damage that it was declared a total loss. Cordova Provider began life as an ice-class oil recovery barge, but in 2005 it was modified with a notch to serve as one half of a unique ATB. The other half, the tug Krystal Sea, was built at the Western Towboat yard at the same time. Instead of coupler pins like those found on an Articouple or Intercon system, the Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider fit together with a wedge-and-recess system that had no moving parts. Three wedges on the tug - one on the bow, one to port and one to starboard - would line up with corresponding recesses within the notch at the stern of the barge. Changes in relative draft could be compensated for by backing out of the notch and re-entering at a different set of recesses. Instead of a positive mechanical connection, the Krystal Sea was held in the slot by four breast lines (push lines) running from the barge to winches on the stern of the towboat, much like an inland towboat. When Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider were built, the lines and bridles were steel wire rope; the operator later exchanged the wire rope for Dyneema soft lines, which were lighter and safer for the crew to handle over the side. Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider operated in this configuration to move breakbulk cargo around Prince William Sound, within sheltered waters. On the morning of January 10, 2025, the ATB got under way from Valdez, headed across the sound for Cordova. The forecast called for winds of 45 knots, consistent with wintertime weather along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Six-foot seas were expected in the sound, rising to 10 feet after midnight. The ATB's call in Cordova was completed swiftly, and the ATB departed for Whittier at 2110. By 0200 hours the next morning, as Krystal Sea crossed the middle of the sound, seas rose to 4-6 feet, with wind and waves on the port quarter of the tug - typical conditions, according to the crew. At 0250, the mate on watch heard a line snap, followed by three more. All four of the Dyneema lines that held the tug and barge together had parted in the middle, and the Cordova Provider was adrift. The master came to the bridge and maneuvered to see if there was a way to regain control of the barge, but the surface conditions made this too dangerous to attempt. Instead, the Coast Guard put the master in contact with the operator of the escort tug Latouche, moored nearby. The Latouche arrived on scene at 0550 hours and attempted to retrieve the barge by getting a line onto a bitt on its stern. The crew succeeded, but the line parted shortly after. Latouche was forced to give up the chase as Cordova Provider drifted into dangerous shallows off Axel Lind Island. The barge then ran aground, sustained extensive hull damage on the rocks, and partially sank. It was later refloated, towed offshore and disposed of through sinking in deeper water. Investigators' focus turned to the lines that connected the two vessels as an ATB unit. The operator had switched to soft shackles and Dyneema pennant lines in 2023-4, and the captain had inspected the rigging about five days before the casualty, finding nothing amiss. After the casualty, a technician from the firm that assembled the lines determined that they were in fair to good condition, with minor abrasion. Three had parted in the middle of the pennant section, and one parted at the soft shackle. All components were rated for a 100,000-pound breaking strength. NTSB concluded that the lines likely parted due to shock loading, with cascading failure after the first line parted. As the tug had served in similar conditions before, the reason for the break on this particular trip is unknown.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Northern Lights Injects First CO2 in Subsea Storage Well,https://maritime-executive.com/article/northern-lights-injects-first-co2-in-subsea-storage-well,,25/08/2025 23:51:55,,"The pioneering Northern Lights project has injected its first shipment of carbon dioxide for long-term storage in a subsea reservoir off the coast of Norway, launching a long-anticipated service backed by Equinor (as operator), TotalEnergies, Shell and the Norwegian government. “With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” said the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, in a statement Monday. Northern Lights is the first commercial-scale project of its kind, and it is the backbone of a constellation of Norwegian carbon-capture initiatives. The offshore reservoir serves as the final destination for carbon from a variety of onshore industries, notably the Heidelberg cement plant in the town of Brevik and the Hafslund waste incineration plant in Oslo. Other future users include Yara, Stockholm Exergi and Orsted, among others, through the provision of long-distance CO2 shipping. An initial small-scale liquefied CO2 shipping service is provided by K Line. Now that Northern Lights is up and running, its backers want to expand it rapidly. The current capacity is just 1.5 million tonnes per year, about the same as the annual emissions of 320,000 non-electric cars. With backing from the EU, its owners plan to add more infrastructure to more than triple that number to 5.0 million tonnes per year. This second development phase should be completed and ready for operation in late 2028. The scope includes an additional jetty, nine new storage tanks, and more injection wells. Over the long term, Equinor wants to have 30-50 million tonnes a year of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035, primarily in Europe and in the U.S.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Italian Coast Guard Responds as Mega MSC Cruise Ship Loses Propulsion Power,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-responds-as-mega-msc-cruise-ship-loses-propulsion-power,,25/08/2025 23:20:27,,"MSC World Europa, one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a reported 8,500 people aboard, lost propulsion early Monday, August 25, off the coast of Italy. The incident drew wide media attention with sensational reports saying it had grounded or crashed. The Guardia Costiera responded to the ship, and it was emphasized that the vessel was never in any physical danger. Introduced in 2022 as the first cruise ship to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, the ship was making a week-long cruise circuit in the Western Mediterranean and sailing between Genoa and Naples when, according to passengers, the vessel stopped at approximately 0530 Monday morning. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard control center at approximately 0730, and two patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched to survey the situation. At 215,863 gross tons, the massive 1,094-foot (333-meter) vessel is reported to have a total of 8,585 people aboard, including 6,496 passengers on an end of summer cruise and 2,089 crewmembers. Some of the passengers were due to disembark today in Naples, and others were waiting to join the ship. The Coast Guard placed officers aboard the ship to survey the situation and reported it was told that the ship was experiencing an electrical problem with its propulsion. The ship is one of the largest to be fueled with LNG and uses Azipods for propulsion. It was built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and is second in size only to Royal Caribbean International’s sister ships Icon and Star of the Seas. MSC introduced a second ship of the class this year and has ordered four more World Class ships. Passengers were reported calm while the ship was drifting approximately eight miles off the coast of the Italian island of Ponza. The ship was able to continue to run its generators and was maintaining passenger services. Two tugs from the ports of Gioia Tauro and Naples were dispatched, and plans were being made to tow the ship, if necessary, the approximately 50 miles to Naples. However, by early afternoon, MSC Cruises was reporting that the crew had been able to initially restore partial propulsion. The Coast Guard did a further inspection, and the ship was moving at 15 knots with a Coast Guard escort to Naples. It docked at 2100 local time on Monday night. MSC said technicians would continue to repair and inspect the cruise ship. Passengers were proceeding with the disembarkation and embarkation. The plan called for the ship to resume its cruise on Tuesday, sailing for Messina.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
"Finnish Prosecutors Demand Jail Time for Captain, Officers of Shadow Tanker",https://maritime-executive.com/article/finnish-prosecutors-demand-jail-time-for-captain-officers-of-shadow-tanker,,25/08/2025 22:31:48,,"The trial for the captain and two senior officers of the shadow fleet tanker Eagle S began on Monday, August 25, in the Helsinki District Court. They are facing charges ranging from aggravated sabotage and aggravated telecommunications interference to lesser charges of vandalism and endangering public safety. The trial stems from the December 25, 2024, damage by the 74,000 dwt tanker Eagle S to the undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia, as well as four telecommunications cables. Prosecutors told the court that the laden tanker, which was registered in the Cook Islands, dragged its anchor for a distance of at least 55 miles in the Baltic. For the first time, they also said in court that the vessel appeared to slow as it passed over the cables, and they contended that if the Finnish authorities had not intervened and seized the tanker, it would have done more damage as it continued its trip. The prosecution is reported to be demanding jail time for the master of the vessel, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, a Georgia national, Robert Egizaryan, another Georgian who was the first officer, and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, an Indian who was the second officer on the vessel. The Finnish news outlet Yle reports the prosecution called for sentences of two and a half years in prison, which is near the minimum of two years under the law. The maximum for aggravated sabotage (criminal mischief) is 10 years in prison, while the aggravated charges for interfering with telecommunications are up to five years. They are saying the charges are “aggravated” because their actions were intentional and deliberate. Prosecutors assert the crew was required to operate the vessel safely. The three individuals are pleading not guilty to the charges. The captain speaking to the Swedish Yle last week said it was a “maritime accident.” Defense lawyers reiterated the claim that it was an accident. The captain claimed to Yle that no alarms sounded and that they did not sense changes in the ship. In court, it was revealed that the ship stopped at midday due to an engine problem and was experiencing heavy weather in the Baltic. They have not said when the anchor was deployed, but they are saying a broken safety pin could have caused it to come loose. The court was also told that the braking system for the anchor was heavily rusted and inoperable. The Vessel Traffic Service had made an inquiry to the ship during the afternoon, at which time they said the second officer denied that the anchor was down. It was not until 1845 that they were told they were dragging something on the seafloor and instructed to raise the anchor. The officers claimed that a check of the mooring deck at dinner time that night was not safe because of the weather. The court will also have to take up the question of jurisdiction. The UAE-based shipping company that managed the Eagle S contends Finland lacks authority because the damage happened in international waters and points out that Finland was not endangered because it sends power to Estonia. During the hearing today, the court was told a manager from the shipping company had instructed the captain to delete a report showing the vessel had crossed over the damaged cables. The prosecution is also asking the court to consider compensation for the damage and repairs. The Finnish and Estonian companies have said it cost them more than $70 million to repair the cables, which were out of service for months. Finland conducted a Port State inspection on the Eagle S at the beginning of January and reported 53 deficiencies ranging from fire safety to structural conditions and violations of the Master Labor Contract for seafarers. They reported that radar and firefighting equipment were inoperable and problems in the cargo pump room. The vessel was detained in Finland for 53 days before it was permitted to sail. The incident raised awareness of the dangers to the subsea infrastructure and the issues with the shadow fleet. Baltic and Scandinavian countries increased their monitoring of the shadow fleet and began challenging the vessels on documentation, including insurance coverage. The countries were also successful in getting NATO to deploy additional resources to the Baltic and North Sea. Russia has responded, denying knowledge of the vessels’ actions, and calling the Western efforts piracy, vowing to defend the shadow fleet tankers.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Egypt and Greece Reject Turkish-Libyan EEZ Claim,https://maritime-executive.com/article/egypt-and-greece-reject-turkish-libyan-eez-claim,,25/08/2025 22:31:21,,"Egypt and Greece have rejected a bilateral accord first tabled in 2019, which seeks to establish a maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya in the Mediterranean. The accord appears likely to be signed up to by the government in eastern Libya, having been agreed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government in western Libya six years ago. The purpose of the accord is to facilitate oil exploration, by establishing a boundary within the sea corridor claimed by Libya and Turkey. When the accord was originally tabled in 2019, it was met with almost universal rejection. It was regarded as a breach of the International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), by the United States, the EU, Russia and the Arab League amongst many, but in particular by Greece, Egypt and Cyprus because the Libyan-Turkish corridor was superimposed over their own UNCLOS-backed claims for 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones. The Turkish-Libyan accord is likely to be hotly contested, and it is not clear what lies behind the revived claim. It is possible that some of those who were originally vehemently opposed to the carve-up have now switched sides, conjecturing that under the Trump administration, potential economic gains could outweigh previous political understandings and the potential breaches of UNCLOS - and also believing that the revival of the Libyan-Turkish claim could become part of a settlement of Libya’s long-running political crisis. Turkey is already in dispute with Greece and Cyprus over exploitation of oil and gas reserves to the south of Cyprus, among many other issues. Greece and Turkey (and Turkey's Ottoman predecessors) have spent centuries contesting territorial control over the region, most recently including the partition of Cyprus in 1974 and the ongoing dispute over islands and maritime zones in the Aegean.

"Trump: ""We're Going to be Buying Ships From South Korea""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-we-re-going-to-be-buying-ships-from-south-korea,,26/08/2025 06:50:56,,"Shipbuilding was at the top of the agenda in talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, and the outcomes included a pledge from Trump to buy ships from Korea. In hopes of securing lower U.S. tariff rates and keeping the multibillion-dollar Korean auto industry competitive on the U.S. market, Seoul pledged an investment of $150 billion in America's shipbuilding sector. The bid was successful: Korea won a 10-point reduction in its tariff rate, putting its manufacturers on the same footing as competitors in Japan and the EU. To get the Trump administration to seal the deal, Korean trade officials came up with a slogan - ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. This gesture won the attention of the administration's trade negotiators, yielding a more favorable 15 percent tariff on Korean cars, computer chips and other exports. Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung was the first major bilateral press conference after the deal was concluded, and it appeared to yield a result that fulfills the hopes of Korean yards as well: an American intention to buy Korean hulls. ""We're going to be buying ships from South Korea,"" Trump said. ""We love their ships."" Trump told reporters that in the long term, ""we're also going to have them make ships here with our people, using our people, and we're going to go back into the shipbuilding business again."" As for timing, Trump emphasized that ""it takes a while"" and that ""shipbuilding is a tough one to start."" In addition to favoring Korean ships, Trump has also spoken highly of Finnish shipbuilding. Earlier this year, he told reporters that he has negotiated personally with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on the terms for purchasing used and new icebreakers from a non-U.S. shipyard. Two Finland-based yards, Helsinki Shipyard and Rauma, are said to be bidding for a program to build medium icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard (in cooperation with local partners in the United States). Korean state investment with U.S. guidance Coinciding with the Trump-Lee meeting on Monday, the U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management announced a partnership with Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai to launch a new ""maritime investment strategy"" focused on American shipbuilding opportunities. The new strategy, Cerberus Maritime, will also look for investment possibilities in the American maritime industry writ large, including maritime logistics, supply chains, infrastructure, ports and technology. HD Hyundai will provide shipbuilding expertise and serve as an anchor investor in the partnership. In addition, it will bring with it the Korean government's state sponsor for shipping and shipbuilding, Korea Development Bank (KDB). The policy bank is known as a lender of last resort for Korean shipyards; it was the largest shareholder in DSME before it arranged the yard's sale to Hanwha in 2022. In its investment role with HD Hyundai and Cerberus, KDB will ""facilitate investments into the Cerberus Maritime strategy"" in recognition of the initiative's importance to Korean national objectives. Cerberus and HD Hyundai have worked together in shipbuilding before. In 2022, Cerberus bought the former Hanjin-owned shipyard in Subic Bay, the biggest yard in the Philippines. Cerberus has leased out part of the space to HD Hyundai, which is investing $550 million at the site and plans to begin building product tankers there by early next year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44
Whale Atlas: An Easy-to-Use Mapping Tool for Whale-Safer Global Navigation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/whale-atlas-an-easy-to-use-mapping-tool-for-whale-safer-global-navigation,,26/08/2025 04:48:00,,"2025 has been a tumultuous year for large whales in California and beyond. At least eight gray whales have been killed by ship strikes just in the Bay Area. While the majority of ship strikes go unobserved and undetected, researchers estimate that 80 endangered whales are fatally struck each year off the West Coast of the U.S. This reality was the impetus behind creating a new online portal which offers digitized details of whale conservation zones to make it easier for mariners planning multinational transits to understand and cooperate with whale-protection measures. In many places throughout the world, high-traffic shipping zones overlap with whale foraging areas and migration routes. Marine managers aim to reduce the risk of strikes by slowing ships down or asking them to avoid certain areas at certain times of the year. For the past ten years, Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies (BWBS) has engaged shipping companies, asking them to reduce their speeds voluntarily to a whale-safer level of 10 knots or less off the coast of California during peak whale migratory season. Programs like BWBS, which verifies cooperation with NOAA’s voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) requests, work collaboratively with industry, and have been proven to be effective - reducing fatal strike risk by 50%. Where and when vessels reduce speeds is just as important as the slowing down itself. Resource managers use the best available science to determine the placement and timing of VSR zones. Video credit: Katherine Brook; vessel and whale footage by Adam Ernster Advancing global awareness and collaboration around whale protection measures Whale conservation programs and protection measures centered on reducing shipping impacts on whales exist around the world, including in the Strait of Gibraltar; Hellenic Trench; Bering and Salish Seas; Costa Rica; Gulfs of Panama, Hauraki and Saint Lawrence; and the Canadian Arctic. In 2023 and 2024 the World Shipping Council released a first-of-its-kind Whale Chart Report that compiled and outlined whale protection measures across the globe in order to raise awareness to mariners of opportunities to reduce biodiversity impacts. This included VSR zones, Areas to be Avoided (ATBAs), and Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), all aimed at directing vessel traffic to either reduce speeds within or stay away from critical whale habitat areas. Seeing an opportunity to make this valuable information more interactive and user-friendly, California Marine Sanctuary Foundation (CMSF) and the BWBS team developed an online platform to enhance how mariners access and engage with the information critical to understanding and cooperating with whale protection measures. CMSF is proud to introduce “Whale Atlas: A Mariners Guide to Whale-Safer Shipping” This new, online portal showcases digitized whale conservation zones and protection measures relevant to maritime shipping activities. It houses information on: Whale Atlas with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary selected, part of the NOAA voluntary VSR request, and Blue Whales Blue Skies program in California Whale conservation zones represent areas where mariners are requested to either: reduce speeds or avoid important habitats for a few months or year-round. Whale Atlas provides this information, as well as the source/administering agency, so mariners can zoom in and out of relevant geographies, learn about opportunities to operate more sustainably, download layers in relevant formats, and incorporate measures into their transit plans. CMSF and the BWBS team will regularly update the data to ensure that the conservation zones are current as guidance, data, and priority zones evolve. Maritime shipping is a global industry, and Whale Atlas brings us one step closer to ensuring that mariners consider whale-friendly shipping practices on the same global scale. Whale Atlas is now live and can be found on the new Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies website at https://bluewhalesblueskies.org/resources/.

Career Submariner Takes Helm as Navy's New Top Officer,https://maritime-executive.com/article/career-submariner-takes-helm-as-navy-s-new-top-officer,,26/08/2025 04:13:21,,"Adm. Daryl Caudle has been sworn in as the Navy's newly-confirmed Chief of Naval Operations, taking over from Vice CNO Adm. Jim Kilby, who has been in the top post in an acting capacity since the dismissal of Adm. Lisa Franchetti in February. Caudle is a chemical engineer by training, and he commissioned into the Navy after graduating from North Carolina State; he holds a masters in physics and another in engineering management, plus a doctorate in organizational leadership. He has run Fleet Forces Command, the Navy's training and sustainment arm, since 2021; before that, he was a career submarine officer, culminating in an appointment as Commander, Submarine Forces - the Navy's top undersea domain officer. ""The sailor will be front and center in my vision throughout my tenure as CNO — hands down, no exception,"" Caudle said at his change of command ceremony. ""To ensure that they are ready to fight and win decisively — today, tomorrow and well into the future — we will view everything we do we through an operational lens focused on three priorities: the foundry, the fleet and the way we fight."" The new CNO also emphasized that the Navy must transform itself with AI, robotics, autonomous systems, hypersonics and other advanced technologies in order to maintain deterrence. ""The way we fight today will not be the way we fight tomorrow,"" Caudle said. Caudle has a reputation as a persistent solver of technical and organizational problems. He was selected at a time of pressing need: all of the Navy's new construction programs are behind schedule, and existing surface combatants, subs, amphibs and carriers face delays at repair yards, reducing availability. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan made clear that Caudle's troubleshooting skills were valued. ""Admiral Caudle, 'the honey badger,' is the right man for the job,"" Phelan said. ""He has a reputation for challenging the status quo, demanding results and refusing to accept excuses. I look forward to seeing that relentlessness pursuit of excellence and persistence pervade the halls of the Pentagon."" Caudle takes the helm at a time of rapid change for the Navy, both in personnel and in structure. Last week, Navy Reserve chief Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Navy Special Warfare commander Rear Adm. Jamie Sands were both dismissed from their posts. The Navy has not provided a reason for the dismissals; both leaders had been promoted to their positions in August 2024. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to pull responsibility for sub procurement out of the Navy's command structure and put it directly under the deputy secretary of defense, according to USNI. A new three-star ""submarine czar"" in the Pentagon will have budget control over sub maintenance, oversee the multibillion-dollar industry-boosting program for the sub supply chain, and work with the Navy to set requirements for new submarines - all functions that previously existed within Naval Sea Systems Command.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44

Fire-Damaged Wan Hai 503 is Being Towed to the Middle East,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fire-damaged-wan-hai-503-is-being-towed-to-the-middle-east,,26/08/2025 19:30:24,,"The fire-damaged containership Wan Hai 503 is going to be towed to the Middle East as the shipping company continues to search for a port of refuge. The vessel has been at sea for 11 weeks (a total of 78 days) since the fire began while it was off the coast of India. Wan Hai released the update saying the tow is underway toward the Middle East, but the final port of refuge is still under consideration. The move toward the Middle East came after Sri Lanka rejected an application for the vessel to be berthed, while India had, shortly after the fire began, ordered its ports not to accept the vessel. The crew reported that the ship experienced an explosion and subsequent fire while sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Nhava Sheva, India on June 9. At the time it was approximately 50 nautical miles off the coast of India. “At present, the vessel’s stability, structural integrity, and draft—together with the route assessed using weather-routing software—meet the requirements for safe towing,” reports Wan Hai. The shipping company working with the appointed salvage company said the process will be closely monitored to ensure a safe and smooth arrival at the designated port of refuge. Last week, Hapag-Lloyd, which had cargo aboard the ship, gave an update putting its position approximately 177 nautical miles from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and close to the Indian EEZ boundary. India, in late June, had ordered the salvage tugs to pull the ship out of its EEZ, where the ship had remained for more than eight weeks while salvage efforts proceeded. For the past few weeks, the salvage reports have indicated that there were no visible flames or signs of fire, although one hold continued to show minor signs of smoldering. Temperatures have also been lowered aboard the ship. Salvors were able to board the ship and undertook the efforts to dewater the holds and engine room. While the danger seems minimal at this point, they have struggled to find a port of refuge. Reports said they were looking to the east, working with Singapore Maritime & Ports Authority as the flag state for the ship. The ship instead is going to be towed approximately 1,800 nautical miles crossing the Arabian Sea. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which also suffered a significant container fire off the coast of India, also ended up making the trip to Khor Fakkan in the UAE before a port of refuge could be settled. However, in that case, the ship had not been abandoned and was traveling under its own power. The UAE has large, deep-water ports that can serve as a refuge. It also has the container handling capabilities to clear the debris from the vessel. The last pictures, which came from the Indian Directorate General of Shipping in mid-July, showed that after the fire was extinguished, nearly everything on the forward two-thirds of the ship in front of the deck house and bridge had been damaged. A few containers on the stern appear to have been blocked from the fire by the deckhouse. The vessel also appeared to be on an even keel and higher in the water after the dewatering efforts.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 21:29:19

Third Training Ship Christened as Backdrop for US-South Korea Shipbuilding,https://maritime-executive.com/article/third-training-ship-christened-as-backdrop-for-us-south-korea-shipbuilding,,27/08/2025 03:49:27,,"The third U.S. training ship, State of Maine, was christened on Tuesday, August 26, in a ceremony designed to highlight the emerging partnership between the United States and South Korea for shipbuilding. The event was rescheduled a week so that it could coincide with the visit to the United States by South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, and a day after he met with Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. The South Korean President toured the Philadelphia shipyard that was acquired by Hanwha Ocean for approximately $100 million at the end of 2024. The company’s acquisition pre-dated the Trump initiative to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding and was seen as an entry into the U.S. naval market. The company looks to expand its work for the U.S. Navy and government ships, such as the training ships, and now to leverage the opportunities under the Trump programs. Hanwha aims to produce LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long term, naval vessels at its U.S. shipyard. Hanwha has committed to a $5 billion program dedicated to the installation of additional docks and quays to increase capacity at the shipyard. It is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility, and through the expansion, Hanwha aims to increase Philly Shipyard’s annual production volume from less than two vessels to up to 20. In addition to the infrastructure investment, the U.S. subsidiary of Hanwha’s shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, announced that it has ordered 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers from Hanwha Philly Shipyard, with the first tanker expected to be delivered by early 2029. It previously announced it will buy a Korean-built LNG carrier and complete its outfitting at the U.S. yard to make it the first modern American-flagged LNG carrier built in 50 years. Elaine Chao doing the honors for the naming (American Maritime Officers) Lee toured Hanwha Philly Shipyard, joined by officials from the Department of Transportation, the Maritime Administration, and others from the U.S. government, while attending the christening ceremony. Speaking through a translator, Lee said, ""The Republic of Korea's shipbuilding industry is setting out to take on a new challenge to contribute to strengthening U.S. maritime security and rejuvenating America's shipbuilding industry."" He highlighted the rapid growth of the country’s industry from “bare ground” to a powerhouse in just 50 years and referred to the “miracle of K-shipbuilding.” ""Through the MASGA (Make American Shipbuilding Great Again) project, we will achieve a 'win-win' outcome that would see the shipbuilding industries of both the United States and South Korea take a leap forward together,"" Lee highlighted. Yesterday, he promised Trump that South Korea would invest at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding, along with other key industries. Hanwha Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim expressed gratitude to the leaders of both countries and emphasized the importance of joint partnership in bolstering the shipbuilding industry. He said, “Today’s christening ceremony is the physical embodiment of our two nations working side by side to reindustrialize industry, expand our capacity to build ships, and invest in the skilled workforce that will drive the industry forward.” The third ship of the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) program, State of Maine, is the first purpose-built training ship for the Maine Maritime Academy. At 525 feet in length, it can accommodate 600 cadets for training and, in times of humanitarian need, can handle up to 1,000 people and provide access to an advanced medical facility. The ship, which is due to arrive in Maine later this year, features eight classrooms, an auditorium, and training labs, including a specially-designed training bridge. It has a helicopter pad and is outfitted both to handle containers and roll-on/roll-off cargo to give the cadets hands-on training. “This vessel marks a new era for American maritime power,” said Acting Maritime Administrator Sang Yi, who represented Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was detained in Washington and did not attend the ceremony. “MARAD’s mission to modernize sealift and empower the Merchant Marine hinges on relentless innovation and partnership. Together, we can build the fleet America needs to secure our future and dominate the seas.” Elaine Chao, who has held various senior roles in the U.S. government, including Secretary of Transportation in the first Trump administration, was godmother for the vessel. In prior administrations, she served on the Federal Maritime Commission and as Secretary of Labor. Philly Shipyard had delivered the first two vessels of the class to New York and Massachusetts. Hanwha Ocean is completing the project to build two additional training ships, which MARAD has assigned to the state maritime academies in Texas and California. The yard has also started work on the first of three LNG-fueled containerships for Matson and is completing a rock installation vessel for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
South Africa Restricts Bunkering to Protect Endangered Penguin,https://maritime-executive.com/article/south-africa-restricts-bunkering-to-protect-endangered-penguin,,27/08/2025 03:06:16,,"South Africa's government has implemented new restrictions on STS transfers and bunkering off its coastline, hoping to head off environmental damage from a potential spill. Its Algoa Bay area is a key bunkering hub for traffic on the Cape of Good Hope route, which has grown by leaps and bounds due to the Red Sea crisis - but conservation groups say that all the activity is putting a colony of critically-endangered penguins at risk. The regulation bans STS transfers within three nautical miles of shore, as well as areas within aquaculture zones and marine protected areas. The rule sets up restrictions on bunkering in Algoa Bay, limiting transfers to specific anchorages and imposing seasonal restrictions on activity. Operators will also have to monitor for the presence of protected penguins and marine mammals during transfers, and will have to use a hydrophone system to listen for the movements of these species. To further reduce the risk of pollution, transfers will be prohibited in wind speeds over 22 knots or wave heights over six feet, and only a limited number of vessels will be allowed in the bay at any given time. Operators will also be required to maintain spill-response vessels on standby to be ready to clean up in the event of a petroleum release. Breaches of the new rules are punishable with a penalty of up to $2.1 million and a prison sentence of up to five years. “These regulations are a decisive step to safeguard our oceans and secure the future of our African Penguin. They set strict standards for offshore ship-to-ship transfers, ensuring that maritime activity can only proceed in a safe and responsible way,"" said South African environment minister Dr. Dion George. Conservationists claim that heightened bunkering activity has cut the population of the African penguin in Algoa Bay by more than 90 percent, putting the world's most endangered penguin species further at risk. Local wildlife NGO SANCCOB said in a statement that it doubts that the new measures will be effective. A colony on Algoa Bay's St. Croix Island was once the largest remaining African penguin colony, with 8,000 breeding pairs living there in 2015, the year before bunkering started in the bay. There are currently 700 breeding pairs on the island, according to SANCCOB, which blamed noise from increased vessel traffic and a series of spills. The group called for banning bunker transfers at night, when releases are least likely to be detected and hardest to clean up, and reducing the wave height limitation to three feet. According to SANCCOB, the government loosened the final version of the rule by removing a requirement for operators to abide by IMO underwater noise reduction guidelines, a modification that favors vessel operators.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Havila Voyages Plans First Climate-Neutral Norwegian Coastal Round Trip,https://maritime-executive.com/article/havila-voyages-plans-first-climate-neutral-norwegian-coastal-round-trip,,27/08/2025 02:47:14,,"Havila Voyages, which already operates four Norwegian coastal cruise ships fueled with LNG and equipped with batteries, reports it is preparing to take the next step: a climate-neutral round trip along the Norwegian coast. The trip will cover more than 5,000 nautical miles, and the company believes it can be part of an example of Norway’s leadership in transitioning the shipping industry. “Right now, we are in the planning phase to test a full round voyage on the coastal route this fall, using biogas in combination with our large battery packs,” said Bent Martini, CEO of Havila Voyages. “We are in dialogue with suppliers to secure sufficient volumes to be able to fill the tanks 100 percent with biogas, and we believe we will succeed.” Martini revealed that Havila Voyages is exploring the possibility of the sailing on its coastal route from Bergen to Kirkenes and back to Bergen. He said they hope to accomplish it as early as this fall. “That would mean that one of our ships, already this fall, could prove that it is possible to sail over 5,000 nautical miles, the entire Coastal Route, climate neutrally.” Havila built four 15,800 gross ton cruise ships using energy-efficient hull designs created to handle the varied conditions along the Norwegian coast. The ships, which can carry up to 650 passengers, including 179 between ports and 468 in cabins, are LNG fueled and equipped with a battery pack of 6.1 megawatt-hours (MWh). The company in June 2022 demonstrated the capabilities of the 86-ton battery pack, which it says allows them to operate emission-free for up to four hours. The Havila Castor sailed using just the batteries, cruising the historic Geirangerfjord. “If Norwegian authorities are serious about their environmental ambitions, the ships on the coastal route can be a beacon for the green transition in shipping and create synergies for other parts of the industry,” says Martini. “The problem for the maritime industry, when politicians waver in their decisions as we saw in the world heritage fjords, is that no one dares to invest in the green shift.” Martini points out that stricter environmental requirements are fully achievable with today’s technology, and he hopes politicians will stand by the standards they set. “Our message to politicians and decision-makers is clear: climate neutrality should be an absolute minimum in the next contract. And we will deliver on that from day one.” Havila made history in 2018 when Norway, for the first time, split the contract for the coastal operations. It received a nine-year agreement from 2021 to 2030 alongside long-term provider Hurtigruten. Hurtigruten has also made investments in the future, adding batteries and increasing efficiency for several of its vessels. The company has revealed a design study it is pursuing to create the first of a new generation of zero-emission cruise ships. Starting on January 1, 2026, Norway begins a six-year phase-in of its zero-emission regulations for coastal shipping. It starts with smaller ships under 10,000 gross tons, and has already spurred programs for zero-emission battery and hydrogen ferries.

As soon as the Russian full-scale invasion began in 2022, the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine's seaports, repeatedly striking foreign-flag merchant ships off the coast. With American and European assistance, Ukraine countered with strikes of its own. Its forces sank the Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva with antiship missiles, and followed up with strikes on Russian warships in Crimea using British/French Storm Shadow cruise missiles. But Ukraine's real innovation was an exploding one-way drone boat, remotely controlled and cheap enough to be expendable. It was based on an American prototype that had been designed to counter a Chinese invasion fleet in the Taiwan Strait, according to the New York Times. Using this American-origin design, American Starlink connectivity, and American targeting support, Ukraine's defense intelligence agency (GUR) began regularly damaging or destroying Russian vessels in and around Crimea using swarm tactics. After several design iterations, Ukraine's drone boats have also been up-gunned to carry strike UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian air patrols. Using a mix of short range missiles, these drone boats have become the first unmanned vessels in history to shoot down helicopters and fighter aircraft. Using drones alone, the GUR's Group 13 helped Ukraine attain sea control of the western Black Sea, driving the Black Sea Fleet into the relative safety of the Novorossiysk area - without the benefit of a conventional navy. Its success made the Magura design instantly recognizable in defense circles. The U.S. Navy has been investing in its own drone prototypes, reportedly with mixed results - but to date it has not publicly included the Magura series in its test and evaluation program. The defense robotics company Red Cat, a supplier of drones to Ukraine and to the U.S. Army, has offered a way to change that. It announced in May that it would begin marketing proven drone boats with ""10,000+ hours of operating time in live combat missions"" and ""dozens of successful kinetic engagements against enemy assets,"" a description that only matches Ukraine's Magura series. Red Cat has now announced a new division to carry this product line forward in the U.S. market. The new division - Blue Ops - will offer a seven-meter ""Expeditionary Multi-Role Craft"" matching the appearance and dimensions of the Magura V7, but built in the United States. It is intended for deep strike, interdiction and anti-ship warfare - like the V7 - and has autonomous capability, increased range and payload capacity. A spokesman confirmed that it is ""based on technology already being built in various European countries and is being used in the Ukraine war."" Red Cat plans to start production in the third quarter of 2025, in partnership with an existing manufacturer of USVs. To head up the Blue Ops team, Red Cat has hired Barry Hinckley, a member of the Hinckley boatbuilding family, former tech executive, and former candidate for U.S. Senate. Hinckley has experience as a yacht broker, a startup founder and an offshore racing yachtsman. The division's co-leader will be Alexander ""Sandy"" Spaulding, the former president of Hinckley Yachts. ""The future of maritime defense depends on a fast, modular weapons system built in the U.S. That’s exactly what we’re delivering,"" said Barry Hinckley in a statement. ""We’re not replacing large naval vessels—we’re building smaller, smarter, uncrewed platforms that extend their reach, provide forward protection, and can operate in places traditional ships can’t.""",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Samsung Heavy Industries Partners with Vigor as Korea Rolls Out MASGA,https://maritime-executive.com/article/samsung-heavy-industries-partners-with-vigor-as-korea-rolls-out-masga,,27/08/2025 02:01:33,,"South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries announced a partnership with Oregon-based Vigor Marine Group as part of the companies committing to U.S. investments during the Korean president’s visit to the United States. SHI looks to use the partnership as a way to break into the lucrative repair business for the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) while also supporting South Korea’s “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) initiative. Hanwha Ocean was the first South Korean shipbuilder to win contracts under the U.S.’s maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program, and recently HD Hyundai Shipbuilding reported it has also won its first MRO contract. It comes as the U.S. looks to expand maintenance capabilities and expedite the projects by keeping the ships forward deployed as opposed to having to wait for limited shipyard space in the United States. SHI reports it will leverage its expertise and efficiency in shipbuilding while adding a new element to the forward-deployed repair program. By partnering with Vigor Marine, they report the partnership will combine VMG’s deep customer relationships, proven ability to deliver complex projects on time and on budget, and innovative, commercial mindset with SHI’s world-class Korean shipyard facilities, skilled workforce, and advanced technology leadership. Vigor Marine Group will serve as the lead U.S.-based prime contractor. “We understand the Navy’s evolving needs and have built a track record of delivering results in support of our national defense,” said Francesco Valente, President & CEO of Vigor Marine Group. “Partnering with Samsung allows us to extend that same capability to forward-deployed operations in the Indo-Pacific and potential shipbuilding opportunities here in the U.S. — helping the Navy increase its operational tempo while maintaining the highest quality standards.” Vigor reports it will continue to develop new ways to perform maintenance and modernization work more efficiently and effectively, while SHI will employ its leadership in automation, digital shipyard technology, and advanced engineering. Together, they promise to introduce new levels of innovation to forward repair operations, streamlining processes, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall fleet readiness. The deal was one of several announced during a trade meeting during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to the United States and meeting with Donald Trump. Korean companies committed to a total of $150 billion in investment in areas ranging from shipbuilding to aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and strategic minerals. Samsung Heavy Industries and Vigor Marine report they will also explore opportunities to support a U.S. shipbuilding renaissance, including a return to Vigor Marine Group’s shipbuilding roots in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor CEO Valente said investment and implementation of SHI’s advanced technology could support new shipbuilding opportunities in the United States. Vigor Marine, after being acquired by Carlyle in 2019, has consolidated its operations under a unified brand name with six locations, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to California and Alaska, as well as Virginia. The company has worked to expand its role as a preferred, full-service prime contractor in the defense and maritime sectors, offering advanced services and complete solutions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, Military Sealift Command, state ferry systems, the cruise industry, the commercial fishing industry, and more. HD Hyundai has also developed partnerships in the United States, including with Edison Chouest Offshore. As part of this week’s trade mission, it also announced an agreement with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank for investments into the U.S. shipbuilding sector. Hanwha Ocean is also planning further investments after buying the Philly Shipyard in 2024 and committing to expanding its operations.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Ukraine Protests as Russia Opens Mariupol and Berdyansk to Foreign Ships,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-protests-as-russia-opens-mariupol-and-berdyansk-to-foreign-ships,,27/08/2025 00:49:03,,"Ukrainian officials are protesting the release of a new list of ports open for foreign vessels, on which Russia is including the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. Both ports have been occupied by Russian forces since 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Mariupol was the tenth largest city in Ukraine and the second largest in the eastern region. It was a vital seaport handling metals, coal, and grain, and when the war began, multiple foreign ships were trapped in the port. The facilities are said to include 22 deep-water berths. Mariupol was the scene of heavy fighting in the first part of 2022 and a siege that ended up focusing on the seaport, an asset which Russia considers a vital prize in its occupation. The city and seaport finally fell into Russian hands in May 2022, and after many months, the foreign ships were able to escape. Russia was reported to be using it as a supply port, but commercial port operations, however, have remained mostly suspended, other than the accusations by Ukraine that Russia is stealing minerals and grains and shipping them from the port. Berdiansk was an equally important seaport, and it fell into Russia's hands in the first month of the war. It is located just 50 road miles west of Mariupol and was under Russian control by March 2022. Reports said Russia had reopened the seaport and was using it to transport military supplies. The listing of seaports released by the Russian Federation on August 22 includes both Berdiansk and Mariupol as open ports able to handle foreign ships. “We consider such actions as another attempt by Russia to legalize its occupation and consolidate illegal control over Ukrainian territories,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said in a statement issued yesterday, August 25. It “strongly condemns” the Russian actions and says it considers the order “null and void.” Ukraine is calling for Western sanctions on any company or ship that uses either port to support commercial activities. In the past, it has also taken action against ships using the occupied seaports of Crimea. The courts have permitted it to seize and auction ships that carried commercial cargoes from Crimean seaports, and it has jailed and fined crewmembers on those ships. Ukrainian media is reporting that Russia has been using both seaports to export grains grown in the east in the occupied areas of Ukraine. They contend that almost 212,000 tonnes of grain were shipped from Zaporizhia Oblast in 2023 to places including Turkey, Libya, Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Over 300,000 tonnes of grain, they report, have been moved through Berdiansk, while as much as 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes a month of minerals are being exported through the Port of Mariupol. The move comes as Russia seeks to further consolidate its gains and exert control in advance of any potential peace talks. Reports said President Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump during their meeting in Alaska that Russia would keep the occupied territories, including the Sea of Azov ports and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, as part of a peace deal. Trump has suggested there would be some “swapping” of land in the peace agreement. Top image: Port of Berdyansk (Andrew Butko / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Op-Ed: MARAD Should Follow Navy's Lead to Rebuild U.S. Maritime Strength,https://maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-marad-should-follow-navy-s-lead-to-rebuild-u-s-maritime-strength,,26/08/2025 23:21:04,,"Earlier this week, CNO Admiral Daryl Caudle and Navy Secretary John Phelan delineated their goals for the Navy - readiness, accountability, and results. They also identified clear metrics for success. The Maritime Administration and the Department of Transportation should tap the table and immediately do the same. While serving as the Maritime Administration (MARAD) Chief Counsel during the first Obama administration, I visited the rusty Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet. RRF crews repeatedly asked for additional funding, an ask I conveyed to the political appointees in the Department of Transportation (DOT). Sadly, fully funding the RRF wasn't a priority for the DOT and the Office of Management and Budget leaders of the day. The same could be said about increasing the maritime workforce, or strengthening shipbuilding. MARAD also struggled with accountability and results. This struggle stemmed from long-standing conflicting priorities between MARAD, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State and Energy. MARAD advocated for US financed goods to be shipped on US owned and crewed vessels. We fought to write the Congressionally-mandated cargo preference rule. The other agencies argued for simple money transfers. MARAD lost, and the result was the undercutting of the US maritime industry. I applaud President Trump's Executive Order on April 9, 2025 entitled ""Restoring America's Maritime Dominance."" It is now the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. It's a clear directive matched with much-needed dollars from Congress. It stops the decades long decay. Admiral Caudle told Navy sailors and civilians that he wants to be judged by specific results at the end of his tenure, to include: The Maritime Administration's equivalent is MARAD goals are intertwined with those set by the Navy. Both need a successful industrial base to build military and commercial ships. Success being ships built and repaired on time, on budget. Both need fully trained sailors. Both need fully manned ships. To put it bluntly, guns and butter have to move at the same time for the logistics tail in war to work. I am encouraged by President Trump's executive order because it demonstrates top down coverage for a robust US maritime industry, something MARAD didn't have during my term in office. We fought with DOT to write the cargo preference rule and then got undercut by USAID and State. We fought to use Jones Act vessels during the 2011 Strategic Petroleum Reserve release and then got sidelined by the Department of Energy, which wanted the oil to move on foreign-flag vessels. The Trump administration has given MARAD and DOT a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's my recommendation that they seize it, match it with Secretary Phelan's directive of readiness, accountability, and results, and adopt CNO Caudle's warfighting charge to ensure the dominance of the US maritime industry and workforce.

Inland shipping and port operations were interrupted as residents were warned of toxic gases, and at last report, 10 people were injured. The German media outlet DPA is reporting that the fire began with a car parked in a warehouse, which was storing hundreds of nitrous oxide cylinders in the south-east district of Hamburg. Firefighters attempting to reach the fire were forced back as the canisters exploded, sending debris flying. One fire truck was reportedly punctured by debris as well as a car on the nearby roadway.

Drydocks World Wins Contract to Build World's Biggest FLNG Installation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/drydocks-world-wins-contract-to-build-world-s-biggest-flng-installation,,26/08/2025 21:39:46,,"DP World's shipyard division, Drydocks World, has been awarded a contract to build the world's largest FLNG project. It will be the first time that the company has built an FLNG, among the most complex types of offshore installation, though the firm has extensive experience with LNG vessels and FSRUs. The contract was awarded by Amigo LNG, a joint venture between Texas-based energy firm Epcilon LNG and Epcilon's transition energy subsidiary, Singapore-based LNG Alliance Pte Ltd. The Amigo LNG offshore development comprises a pair of 2.1 mtpa FLNGs, plus two FSUs to store and offload the product. Combined, the offshore facility will have a capacity of 4.2 mtpa, a small but incrementally important volume. The installation site is located off the coast of Guaymas, Sonora - in the sheltered Gulf of California - but the gas to be liquefied will come from America. The site location is well situated for exports of gas from the Permian to Asian markets, without the time and cost of the Panama Canal transits needed by LNG plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. ""By partnering with Drydocks World on the world’s largest FLNG facility, we are securing best-in-class quality, exceptional production capacity, and reliable long-term performance of this critical asset. We are also harnessing the key advantages of FLNG solutions — from faster project schedules to rigorous testing and seamless pre-commissioning in a controlled fabrication yard environment,"" said Dr. Muthu Chezhian, CEO of the LNG Alliance. Amigo LNG's previously-published development plan called for building an onshore 7.8 mtpa terminal in the port of Guaymas, not an offshore plant. On Monday, LNG Alliance announced that it has signed a long term sale and purchase agreement with Macquarie covering 0.6 mtpa of the facility's production for the first 15 years of operation. Amigo LNG said that it would have its first liquefaction train for that contract up and running in the second half of 2028, the same timetable as the completion of Drydocks World's FLNG commissioning.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Trump Administration Plans to Withdraw Approval for Maryland Offshore Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-signals-intent-to-withdraw-approval-give-us-wind,,26/08/2025 21:15:16,,"The efforts to derail the U.S. offshore wind energy business are continuing with the Department of Justice confirming the Trump administration’s intent to withdraw previously issued approvals for Maryland’s first offshore wind farm to be developed by US Wind. Justice informed district courts in Delaware and Maryland of its intended action following an earlier jurisdictional dispute between Maryland and the federal Environmental Protection Agency that also sought to challenge the process for the Maryland project. The TV news channel in Maryland, WBOC, reported on Friday, August 22, that the Department of Justice had moved to stay a pending lawsuit in Delaware in which a homeowner is challenging the wind farm’s permits under the Clean Water Act. The reasoning the DOJ gave was its intent to withdraw approval for the wind farm, making the court case irrelevant and a waste of time. DOJ on Monday, August 25, WBOC reports, filed additional details in the District Court of Maryland. There it told the court that the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) intends to “voluntarily remand and vacate its approval of the Construction and Operations Plan” for US Wind’s Maryland windfarm project. DOJ revealed the action would come by September 12. The filing does not reveal the reasoning, but opponents of the project have long argued the approval process was rushed, lacked transparency, and “completely ignored” the concerns of residents and the city government in Ocean City, Maryland. In the past, BOEM and the Department of the Interior have said they found “concerns” when they reviewed the approval process for other wind farm projects. Last week, the Department of Commerce also cited national security concerns, saying it would launch a review of the foreign supply of material and equipment for the wind energy industry. The Biden administration approved the Maryland wind farm project in 2024 after what the company says was a multi-year and rigorous public review process. Residents and businesses in Ocean City have argued that the wind farm would hurt their tourism business. US Wind asserts that the project has a strong legal footing, and it is confident that the project’s permits were validly issued. US Wind, which is a partnership between Italy’s Renexia and American investment firm Apollo Global Management, won its lease for nearly 47,000 acres in August 2014. Final federal approvals were given in 2024, and by Maryland in June 2025. The plan calls for two phases, which, when completed, would have 114 turbines and approximately a total of 2 GW. Reports said construction could start as early as 2026, although the DOJ is citing 2028. The EPA last month sought to challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment, alleging the state was making an error in the administration of the final appeal process for permits issued to the wind farm. The state authority fired back, saying it was the EPA that was wrong, that the authority lay with the state, and that state-issued permits adhere to, or are more stringent than, federal requirements. Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who was already in a war of words with Donald Trump over the assertions about Baltimore’s police and a plan to send in the national guard, angrily responded to the news that the administration plans to challenge the wind farm. In a statement to WBOC, Moore called the administration’s plans “utterly shortsighted,” citing the investments and jobs the wind farm would provide. He said the president’s actions will directly lead to utility rate hikes for Marylanders. Moore followed the governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, who have also been speaking out after the administration last Friday, August 22, issued a stop work order for Revolution Wind, an offshore project that has been under construction since 2024. Denmark’s Ørsted said it would comply while noting the project is 80 percent installed. It is looking for clarity and considering actions, including a lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken multiple steps since its January 2025 inauguration, starting with the presidential executive order putting the sector and the leasing process under review. It has suspended future licenses, approvals, and reviews, and then started challenging approved projects. In New Jersey, it withdrew an EPA permit related to the proposed construction of a wind farm, while in New York, it suspended offshore work for a month for the Empire Wind project. In New York, it relented after political pressure, including from the Norwegian government, and reports of a deal to permit a blocked oil pipeline to proceed. The actions of the administration have created further uncertainty and pressure on an industry that was already facing challenges ranging from rising costs to supply chain problems and a lack of vessels for installation. Investors have backed away from the U.S. industry, saying the latest moves are making the risks too high to proceed with developments.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54

Mazagon Dock and Indian Coast Guard Place Record High-Speed Order,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mazagon-dock-and-indian-coast-guard-place-record-high-speed-order,,27/08/2025 04:35:55,,"[By: Everllence] Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., based in Mumbai, India, has placed an order for 14 × 3 × 16V175D-MM high-speed engines from Everllence. The engines will power 14 Fast Patrol Vessels (FPVs) currently under construction for the Indian Coast Guard. The engines are all rated at 2,960 kW and scheduled for delivery from December 2025 to December 2027. The FPVs will be equipped with waterjet propulsion systems and are designed to reach speeds exceeding 33 knots. They will be deployed for coastal surveillance, fisheries protection, search-and-rescue operations, and can also be used for military missions in times of crisis. Ben Andres, Head of Sales at Everllence, said: “This project marks a major milestone for Everllence as we enter the Indian Coast Guard market – a highly strategic and demanding customer - and extend our long partnership with Mazagon Dock with another significant order. We are proud to be part of this collaboration, which not only strengthens our presence in the region but also highlights the trust placed in our 175D engine.” Waldemar Wiesner, Vice President, Head of Marine and PrimeServ Marine & Power, Middle-East/Africa at Everllence, said: “The 175D proved to be the right technical choice for this project. Close collaboration with Mazagon Dock’s technical and commercial teams was key to securing this important contract. We are thankful to the Indian Coast Guard for its timely scrutiny of technical documents and technical clearance.” The new order follows closely on the heels of another major, Indian order that Everllence won in April 2025, that time from the Indian Navy when Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. ordered complete propulsion packages from Everllence for five newbuild Fleet Support Ships. Each scope of supply features 2 × 20V32/44CR engines. About the 175D engine Everllence developed the 175D engine range to supplement and complete its product portfolio in the maritime sector. Available in three variants of 12-, 16- and 20-cylinders, the engine is available with an output ranging from 1,500 to 4,400 Kilowatts and is optimised for propelling ferries, offshore support ships, tugs and other working vessels. Other market areas, such as superyachts, planing yachts and naval marine applications are also served by additional engine variants. The 175D is also an extremely eco-friendly engine, having been designed from the outset for low fuel-consumption, coupled with compliance to the latest exhaust-gas emission standards and considering as well future-fuel requirements where it is already cleared for operation on biofuels such as FAME and HVO.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 09:30:11
"Owners of Ex-Bouchard ATB Fleet Tussle in Court, Sidelining Vessels",https://maritime-executive.com/article/owners-of-ex-bouchard-atb-fleet-tussle-in-court-sidelining-vessels,,27/08/2025 04:19:02,,"Pennantia, the JV company that acquired eight ATBs out of the former Bouchard fleet, has paused its operations amidst a legal fight between its majority owner and its operator. One of the vessels has been arrested in Panama on a lien filed by the operator, and another of the idled ATBs may have attracted Coast Guard attention over manning levels, according to court filings. The shipowning JV, Pennantia, is majority-owned by Contrarian Capital, with minority owner Rose Cay handling maritime operations under contract (the Rose Cay name is the fleet's operating brand). Rose Cay alleges that Pennantia - controlled by Contrarian Capital - has stopped paying in full for operating expenses, and it has suspended shipmanagement services while demanding repayment. In response, Pennantia sued Rose Cay and accused it of trying to shut down operations on a false pretext in order to scuttle the pending sale of the ATB fleet. Both parties deny each others' allegations. The fallout is a new speed bump for the remnants of the Bouchard empire. The Pennantia partnership bought eight ATBs from the former Bouchard Transportation fleet when Bouchard was dissolved and its assets split up in 2021. Pennantia's acquisition includes younger Jones Act vessels, ranging from 4,000-horsepower tugs up to the tanker-sized ex-Kim M. Bouchard / RCM 270. After purchase, the fleet was initially operated by Foss under contract, but Rose Cay took over management in 2022. At that time, it took crewing and operations under its own umbrella and subcontracted these tasks to a new subsidiary, named Dove Cay LLC. In December 2024, Rose Cay claimed that Pennantia owed about $9.5 million in unpaid expenses and interest to Dove Cay, and in February it escalated with a declaration that Pennantia was in default. (Pennantia denies these claims.) Dove Cay then filed liens against the entire Pennantia fleet totaling about $29 million, including $13 million for repayment of a loan. In response, Pennantia called Rose Cay's claims ""fabricated"" and last month it filed for a court injunction to prevent Rose Cay and Dove Cay from idling the fleet or pursuing their maritime liens. In an order signed on August 18, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Pennantia's motion for an injunction in the case, allowing Dove Cay to pursue its liens against the vessels while litigation continues. The judge also allowed Rose Cay to terminate its shipmanagement contract with Pennantia, on the understanding that minimum safety and manning requirements would continue to be met. The two parties are in mediation and have discussed possible terms for a settlement; in the meantime, AIS data shows that the firm's active tugs are all at berth or at anchor in New York, Panama and Port Arthur.

Digitalisation Presents Emerging Psychological Pressures for Seafarers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/digitalisation-presents-emerging-psychological-pressures-for-seafarers,,27/08/2025 03:20:17,,"[By: VIKAND] As the digital transformation accelerates across the maritime industry, global maritime healthcare leader VIKAND warns there is a growing need to recognise and address the psychological toll of new technologies on seafarers’ mental health. While digitalisation has enabled earlier intervention and expanded access to mental health services onboard, such as remote counselling and telehealth, VIKAND notes that the long-term impact on seafarers' well-being is still unfolding. “Early access to care is undoubtedly promising, but we're only beginning to understand the psychological cost of this digital shift,” says Martin Hedman, VIKAND's Director of Mental Wellness Practices. “Technology is a double-edged sword - it streamlines support, yet introduces stressors that we haven’t fully accounted for. “Over the past 20 years, new psychological stressors have emerged from digital life including doomscrolling fatigue, loneliness from social isolation through phone use, and anxiety from navigating the increasingly complex digital processes.” One of the most pressing concerns is the persistent stigma and privacy issues surrounding digital mental health services. Many crew members, particularly senior staff, remain cautious about engaging with these services due to concerns that their data could be misused or held against them, such as losing their jobs. These anxieties, while rarely spoken outright, are frequently raised in informal conversations. Generational differences also play a role. “Older crew members often struggle more with digital interfaces, such as using smartphones for training or health access,” says Martin. “What is intuitive to a younger seafarer may be a barrier to another, amplifying stress and isolation.” Though no direct increase in mental health cases explicitly citing “technology” or “automation” has been recorded, VIKAND observes that digitalisation subtly contributes to workload pressures and fatigue, particularly in non-marine departments tasked with managing complex digital systems. Mental health professionals are integrating tech-related stress and digital fatigue into broader wellness discussions, though VIKAND says formal protocols are still emerging. Looking ahead, Martin notes that ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) could become a growing theme. With constant connectivity, seafarers are increasingly exposed to life onshore potentially heightening feelings of separation from family or online social engagement. “FOMO will be a big part of the ever so connected seafarers’ stress in the future. That is not just stress about always checking your email or social media account, but also to become even more aware of what you are missing out when you are away such as being reminded of family,” explains Martin. Additionally, automation may streamline tasks but also shift certain responsibilities onto crews, sometimes increasing the administrative load. “It’s important that we ensure these tools are implemented with care – designed to support, not overwhelm,” adds Martin. ""We need to balance the benefits of technology with a more mindful approach. He adds that with connectivity, over-accessibility may foster habits of always needing to be online, potentially leading to digital dependency. . “In today’s connected world, mental health and digital environments are closely linked,” concludes Martin. “The maritime industry could benefit from adapting further to that reality.” For more information about VIKAND’s mental wellness initiatives, visit www.vikand.com.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 09:30:11
Wallem Launches Vessel IT Security and Management Services,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wallem-launches-vessel-it-security-and-management-services,,27/08/2025 03:10:58,,"[By: Wallem Group] Wallem Group, a leading global maritime partner, has launched a suite of support and consultancy services to protect IT systems onboard its clients’ vessels from disruption. Its new Vessel IT Security and Management Services (VITS) offer comprehensive support to enable smooth, secure and efficient IT at sea in an increasingly digitalised and regulated maritime world. VITS have been developed with a ship's entire digital ecosystem in mind – from its business networks to the Internet of Things (IoT) systems on which operations and humans rely. It includes six management and security services to help keep vessel IT systems up and running, and minimise cyber threats. Wallem VITS offer continuous Servicedesk Support to customers from experts in vessel IT. When necessary, enquiries are escalated to specialist in-depth service teams. A Remote Vessel Infra Support service swiftly resolves IT issues from shore. In more complex cases, Wallem offers Onboard Vessel IT Support, deploying engineers to the ship to offer hands-on assistance with IT infrastructure, system upgrades, health checks and troubleshooting. “The VITS suite is Wallem’s comprehensive response to shipping’s advancing digitalisation, and the critical role IT reliability plays in maritime operations,” said Steve Whitby, Group IT & Technology Director, Wallem Group. “Ship owners increasingly seek efficiencies from remote IT support, remote management, and remote monitoring of vessel operations. Securing these benefits requires deep IT knowledge and long-standing maritime experience. VITS delivers these core specialised services.” Shipping’s growing reliance on IT explained why the other three service modules in VITS focus on cyber security, added Whitby. “Modern vessel operations demand connected IT infrastructure, but this can expose outdated onboard systems and virus signatures, hardware performance issues, and deficiencies in data back-up and IT support. Owners must secure networks, onboard systems, and data against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorised access. VITS offers tailored services to safeguard vessel IT.” VITS includes a Vulnerability Management service, through which the Wallem team scans shipboard computers annually to identify vulnerabilities, then applies patches and security-hardening measures remotely to ensure the vessel's IT remains secure and compliant. Its Advanced Endpoint Protection, meanwhile, is a signatureless security service that uses machine learning and behavioural analysis to defend systems against zero-day attacks and evolving threats. Critical systems are safeguarded by an Enhanced Backup Service, which is activated in the event of a cyber-attack or hardware failure. It features a network-based back-up vault with integrated virus protection, remote monitoring and restoration support. VITS also offers a Security Benchmark Service, reporting on security gaps, compliance shortfalls and best practice.

Navy Officer Takes the Helm at Central Command,https://maritime-executive.com/article/navy-officer-takes-the-helm-at-central-command,,27/08/2025 06:14:37,,"Command of United States Central Command, whose area of responsibility stretches through 21 countries from Israel in the West, across the Middle East, to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the East, changed earlier this month. General Michael Kurilla, in post since April 2022 and a combat-seasoned infantry officer, handed over to Admiral Brad Cooper. A change in command often signals a change in emphasis. Admiral Cooper hitherto has commanded the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59), the Ticonderoga Class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG 64) at ship level, and at fleet level Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Expeditionary Strike Group 7 in Okinawa, US Naval Forces Korea and the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. He has moved up from being Deputy Commander CENTCOM. He thus has intimate experience of the Middle East region acquired over many years, has recently overseen anti-Houthi operations in the Red Sea and understands in depth the character of threats posed by Iran’s regional activities. Despite priorities being accorded to the threat posed by China, conflicts in the Middle East continue to demand Department of Defense attention, notwithstanding a desire to pivot away from never-ending issues. Those selected for command at Theatre level qualify on the basis of their political acumen as well as their joint command experience, so the service background of Admiral Cooper should not be of immediate relevance in tackling these recurring Middle Eastern issues. Indeed, in similar circumstances, new commanders normally endeavor to compensate for perceived loyalty to their own parent service by focusing particularly hard on the requirements of other services. Admiral Cooper is likely to be no different. However, over time, Admiral Cooper’s substantial naval experience in the Middle East is likely to influence his approach to operational issues as they arise. Admiral Cooper has an academic interest in intelligence matters, and was instrumental in fielding Task Force 59, a fleet of unmanned surveillance drones able to improve surveillance of the Iranian coastline and other maritime bottlenecks. He is likely, once he has settled in to his new and wider responsibilities, to have particular ideas on how to improve the effectiveness of naval operations in his area of command, using this background, and now has increased influence on Congressional budgeting to fund such initiatives. However, he will have to overcome resistance and competition from Indo-Pacific Command, which will complain about the diversion of resources and heavy expenditure of missiles in recent Middle East engagements. Having an officer with this particular experience-set in charge of CENTCOM should in due course have significant impact on operations countering malign Iranian and Houthi maritime activities - but in ways which will not necessarily be advertised in advance. Given Admiral Cooper’s track record, these are likely to include an emphasis on technical innovation, alongside less reliance on long-term ground presences and a greater exploitation of the flexibility of naval power projection.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 15:41:55
Trump Doubles Tariffs on India Over Russian Oil Imports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-doubles-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-imports,,27/08/2025 06:04:58,,"Following through on its pledge to penalize India for buying Russian oil, the Trump administration has raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. The decision doubles the effective tariff rate on Indian exports, applying more pressure on New Delhi to negotiate trade terms with Washington. Export manufacturers in India have already begun laying off staff in anticipation of reduced American demand for the country's big export categories, like diamonds, jewelry, clothing and farmed shrimp. The 50 percent tariff is exceptionally high compared with the 15 percent base levy for Japan, South Korea and the EU, or even the 20 percent rate negotiated by neighboring Bangladesh; it compares to the rate for India's major-power rival, China, which currently faces a 55 percent tariff. The tariff hike puts Indian exporters in a bind, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded with stimulus measures. He has promised to cut taxes to offset loss of income, and has doubled down on his message of ""Make in India"" self-reliance. ""Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties - we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches,"" Modi said at an address in Delhi. Modi has also scheduled an unusual trip to China, his first since 2018. India and China have faced off along their mountainous border region for years, and relations have been chilly since a major clash in 2020. But both face major trade challenges with Washington, and Modi - a key U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific - has decided to fly to Beijing for a security summit attended by leaders from Pakistan, Iran, Russia and other nations. Chinese President Xi Jinping will preside over the gathering this weekend. ""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" Modi said last week, emphasizing normalization. China has undergone a tariff roller-coaster even more pronounced than India's, ranging from 20 percent in February to 125 percent in May, then back down to the current level of 55 percent. On Monday, President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports up again to 200 percent if Beijing does not allow the resumption of shipments of rare-earth magnets, critically needed for U.S. defense applications. A tariff ""truce"" between the two sides is in effect until November, and China has dispatched top negotiator Li Chenggang to Washington this week to continue talks towards a permanent agreement, according to the Wall Street Journal.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 15:41:55

A large cargo ship was driven onto the shore, and at least four people have died from injuries and flooding during the powerful storm. The storm was traveling west across the Pacific, encountering the Philippines as a tropical depression and dropping large amounts of rain on portions of China. By the time it reached Vietnam, it had strengthened with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to NASA. Other parts of Vietnam were reporting sustained winds of 82 mph. Vietnam had been preparing for the storm. At least half a million people had been evacuated before Kajiki reached the coastline. The wood chip carrier Thanh Thanh Dat 99 (22,300 dwt) had been anchored at the northern port of Ninh Binh, but on the evening of August 25, during a lull ahead of the storm attempted to sail south toward Nghi Son port. The ship, which is 495 feet (151 meters) in length, was traveling only with ballast as it was due to load in Nghi Son. The captain reported that by the time they reached the anchorage, the winds and waves were too strong to drop anchor. They were attempting to hold the ship in position as the storm approached. At 11:30 p.m. local time on August 25, they notified the authorities that the vessel was drifting from a position approximately two nautical miles offshore. Two hours later, they reported that the ship was dangerously close to shore. The cargo ship came to rest approximately 70 to 100 meters (230 to 325 feet) from shore. The authorities reported the ship was stable and that the crew was uninjured. They will explore refloating the ship after the storm has passed. The country is continuing to deal with widespread flooding and damage to structures. At least 13 people were reported injured in addition to the four confirmed deaths. The storm continued west, weakening with winds of 38 mph as it reached the border with Laos.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 21:29:11
HD Hyundai to Merge Ulsan Shipyards to Expand Defense and Commercial Work,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-to-merge-ulsan-shipyards-to-expand-defense-and-commercial-work,,27/08/2025 19:52:01,,"HD Hyundai, which is already South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, announced plans to reorganize by merging its shipbuilding operations in Ulsan to realize opportunities both in naval shipbuilding and repair, and the South Korean MASGA (Make America Shipbuilding Great Again) initiative. The company said that it looks to take a leadership role in the South Korean program following the meeting earlier this week between the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, and Donald Trump, in which South Korea committed to investing at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding and other key industries. As part of the agreement, the company announced a new partnership with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank to pursue a maritime investment strategy. Under the terms of the proposed merger, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries will acquire the mid-sized operation HD Hyundai Mipo with HHI as the surviving company. HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding holding company, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, owns 74 percent of HHI and 42 percent of Mipo, and after the merger will have a 69 percent position in the combined company. HHI says the merger is an effective response to future changes in the shipbuilding industry and points to the opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs and structure by integrating its systems. Media reports are highlighting that China recently consolidated its two large shipbuilding companies and that Japan’s two largest shipbuilders have also reorganized. In the first seven months of 2025, HD KSOE reported that it booked orders for a total of 82 ships worth $11.22 billion. It has achieved 62 percent of the annual order target of $18.05 billion for 2025. HHI specializes in larger vessels, including LNG carriers and containerships, while Mipo is considered a medium-sized operation building containerships, chemical tankers, and vehicle carriers. One of the key markets the combined company will be targeting is defense shipbuilding, which HD Hyundai highlighted to investors as a rapidly growing segment as countries expand their investments. HHI reports it has built 106 naval vessels, more than any other domestic shipbuilder. It has experience with destroyers, frigates, submarines, and patrol boats, and looks to expand both internationally and specifically with the United States as part of the MASGA program. “We will increase our competitiveness in the K shipbuilding and defense sectors by reorganizing the shipbuilding business,” the company told investors. It said the target is to grow defense revenues to $7.2 billion annually by 2035. It also looks to expand its entry into the repair business. The company recently won its first MRO contract from the U.S. for the overhaul of a U.S. Military Sealift vessel, USNS Alan Shepard, a 41,000-ton displacement Lewis and Clark class dry cargo and ammunition vessel. As part of MASGA, they believe this business segment will grow rapidly. They also look to expand their expertise in specialty ships, pointing to the opportunity for icebreakers due to the rise in Arctic development. South Korea previously announced that it plans to launch an Arctic shipping initiative and recently ordered a new Arctic research vessel. The combined company will also accelerate its focus on green shipping. They will consolidate the R&D and design capabilities of the two shipbuilders. Mipo will also provide additional capacity to the combined company, as reports are that it is currently operating at a rate of 45 ships but has a capacity to reach 70 ships annually. The combined company plans to launch by December a new overseas investment holding company to be based in Singapore. It will manage the operations of the shipyards in Vietnam and the newly launching yard in the Philippines, as well a the recently acquired tank and crane manufacturer in Vietnam that it has agreed to acquire from Doosan. HD Hyundai has also been exploring additional overseas operations, including possibly a shipyard in Morocco and Egypt, and has formed new relationships in the United States.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 21:29:11

"Australian Police Find 900 Kilos of Meth in Container of ""Spring Rolls""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/australian-police-find-900-kilos-of-meth-in-container-of-spring-rolls,,28/08/2025 03:19:26,,"Australian authorities have seized an exceptionally large shipment of amphetamine in a shipping container at a port in New South Wales, among the largest ever found in the region. On August 20, a team of Australian Border Force officers used intelligence profiling to pick a container for extra scrutiny at Port Botany. When they x-rayed the box, which was marked ""vegetable spring roll and more,"" they found that the ""and more"" part of the cargo declaration was accurate. Instead of spring rolls, they found hundreds of boxed rolls of shrink-wrap packaging, each roll filled with a core of white granules. The substance tested positive for amphetamine. In total, the concealed drugs amounted to about 900 kilos of amphetamine, worth a total of $40 million on the street in Australia. The ABF turned the matter over to the Australian Federal Police, which determined that the shipment was linked to a serious organized crime group with transnational ties. The drug consignment was added to a legimate shipment, authorities believe, without the cargo owners' knowledge. Courtesy AFP AFP carried out search warrants at a warehouse in Western Sydney and a house on the north side of Sydney Harbour, and the investigation continues. ""We use a sophisticated intelligence and risk assessment based approach, which has proven to yield significant results,"" ABF Superintendent Jared Leighton said. ""The scale of harm that would have been caused if these drugs landed in our community is unimaginable."" It is the latest in a long string of illegal stimulant busts at ports in Australia, which (per UNDOC) is the developed world's top per-capita consumer of cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine. Organized crime groups from China and South America have a hand in these illicit supply chains, attracted by the towering profits to be found on the Australian drug market. Smugglers continue to innovate: in January, AFP officers seized a cargo of ""pink cocaine,"" a club-drug mixture with ketamine and MDMA, and last October the agency caught a group that had hidden bricks of cocaine inside of two crated marine engines.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Ship Manager Fined $2M for MARPOL Offense After Crew Provides Evidence,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ship-manager-fined-2m-for-marpol-offense-after-crew-provides-evidence,,28/08/2025 02:33:51,,"U.S. officials are reporting yet another case in which a MARPOL violation was discovered after a crewmember turned over evidence to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Department of Justice reported on August 25 that V.Ships Norway pleaded guilty to the violation and was sentenced to pay a $2 million fine. “Dumping oil-contaminated waste into the waters around our ports and coasts violates the law and poses an unnecessary health and environmental hazard,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “The crew took pains to hide their illegal activity by knowingly keeping inaccurate records. We will not turn a blind eye to this kind of irresponsible and fraudulent activity.” DOJ reports that between February 2022 and August 2022, a hose was connected between the incinerator waste oil tank and the sewage holding tank on the product tanker Swift Winchester (46,000 dwt). The vessel was at the time operating under the Marshall Islands flag and owned by Winchester Shipping and managed by V. Ships. The hose was a type of “magic pipe” that allowed oily waste to transfer into the sewage holding tank and then to be discharged directly into the sea, bypassing required pollution prevention equipment. A low-ranking engine crewmember reported this to a superintendent at V.Ships. The superintendent investigated the matter and discovered what appeared to be oil in the sewage tank. DOJ acknowledges that V.Ships dismissed the Chief Engineer. In August 2022, the new Chief Engineer ordered the engine crew to clean the Oil Water Separator (OWS) filter. The engine crew took the filter onto the deck and hosed it down with a degreaser, and the oily waste washed directly overboard through a scupper. Coast Guard members from the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur conducted an examination of the vessel. While they were in the engine room, a crewmember disclosed the discharges and provided photographic and video evidence documenting the illegal discharges. The M/T Swift Winchester was charged with entering Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 25, 2022, and Port Arthur, Texas, on September 7, 2022, with a knowingly falsified Oil Record Book. V.Ships admitted that oily bilge water and oily waste were discharged from the vessel and that the discharges were omitted from the Oil Record Book.

NATO Patrol Aircraft Chase Russian Sub as U.S. Carrier Operates off Norway,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nato-patrol-aircraft-chase-russian-sub-as-u-s-carrier-operates-off-norway,,28/08/2025 02:11:29,,"A substantial share of the NATO maritime surveillance aircraft fleet has been engaged in tracking a Russian submarine off the coast of Norway. The movements of Russia's attack subs are of interest every day, but this one has attracted extra attention because it is in the same region as the carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is currently operating alongside Norwegian allied forces in the North Sea. According to the UK's Daily Express, P-8 surveillance aircraft from the UK, the U.S. and Norway have saturated a search area near the Ford Carrier Strike Group since last week. More than two dozen sorties have been flown so far, including at least eight flown by the UK's Royal Air Force. Some of the capacity originated from an airbase in Sicily, on the other side of Europe, suggesting a high priority for diverting assets to this mission. A UK defense source told The Sun that the operation was ""highly unusual,"" and several British sources called it a show of force from NATO. “It is telling Russia: ‘We see you,'” former Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe told the outlet. The Barents Observer has reported that three Yasen-class Russian attack subs departed the pens at Severomorsk earlier this week, based on satellite imagery. USS Gerald R. Ford and her escorts departed the Mediterranean earlier this month and transited through the English Channel to reach the North Sea. On arrival, the Ford strike group met up with Norwegian units to conduct joint drills. The exercise is part of Ford's deployment to the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations, and is intended to demonstrate the ""U.S. Navy's ironclad commitment to the stability and security of the European theater."" Separately, Russian fighters intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8A over the Black Sea on Wednesday, and the pilots filmed an interaction with the U.S. Navy plane. This particular P-8 had extended its rarely-spotted AESA radar, the Advanced Airborne Sensor pod - a powerful air and surface search device. The P-8 was on a mission to patrol the waters off Novorossiysk, the Russian Navy's bastion in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea.

Japan Proposes Changes in Wind Energy Terms as Mitsubishi Withdraws,https://maritime-executive.com/article/japan-proposes-changes-in-wind-energy-terms-as-mitsubishi-withdraws,,28/08/2025 02:08:37,,"The Japanese government is looking for means to revitalize its lagging efforts to develop offshore wind energy. The move comes as Mitsubishi, which in a consortium had won the first large auction, confirmed it has decided not to proceed with three wind farms. Japan’s offshore wind energy sector has been slow to start and faces significant challenges due to the offshore topography. There are limited near-shore positions for fixed-bottom wind turbines. To achieve the government’s goals of 45 GW by 2040, the industry will have to develop floating wind technology. To date, Japan has developed only a few small near-shore wind farms with a total installed capacity of approximately 300 MW. The consortium with Mitsubishi won in December the first large-scale auctions that consisted of three offshore sites near Akita on the northwest of Honshu in the Sea of Japan and Chiba, which is approximately 25 miles from Tokyo. The two sites on the Sea of Japan called for 819 MW and 478.8 MW, while the site near Tokyo would have been 390 MW, and all were fixed-bottom projects. Work was expected to start this year and next, and collectively they called for nearly 1.7 GW. Mitsubishi announced a review of the projects in February, citing increasing costs and changed economics, while reporting it would record a $354 million charge. The company, however, initially denied media reports earlier this week that indicated that the projects were being canceled. However, in a statement issued on August 27, Mitsubishi confirmed it has decided not to proceed with the development of the projects. The company said that the business environment for offshore wind power has changed worldwide due to factors such as tight supply, inflation, exchange rates, and rising interest rates, since the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. It called the changes unexpected and said that while it continues to recognize the role of renewable energy, it would not be proceeding with the three projects. The group was involved in the manufacture of wind turbine generators since 1982, but sold its joint venture to Vestas in 2020. “To adapt to these unexpected changes, we have been pursuing various options, including reassessment of costs, project schedule, and revenue. However, after discussions among the partners, we have determined that establishing a viable business plan is not feasible given the current conditions,” the company said in its statement. Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Yoji Muto, called the decision “deeply regrettable.” He said it would undermine trust in the industry. The Ministry, along with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, had just completed an expert panel review of the industry. It submitted a proposal to the government calling for revising the terms of the leases, adding a provision so that companies could apply for an additional 10 years. The leases in the first three rounds of auctions in Japan provided a 30-year total term and required removal and rebidding at the end of the term. Experts point out that companies would have approximately 20 years of operation after the time required for permitting and construction. The panel said adding 10 years would give companies more time to improve cash flow, increase electricity sales, and provide for earlier capital recovery. They believe this will also attract a broader range of investors. They proposed changing the terms for future auctions, but did not address making the provision for the 10-year extension available for the existing leases. The ministry said it plans to restage the auctions for the leases that Mitsubishi is not proceeding with. In Europe, they have also begun to extend wind leases. Denmark in June issued the first extension for an offshore wind lease. It followed with two more agreements later that same month, also highlighting that the extended term would improve the economics of some of its oldest operating wind farms while also maintaining the flow of renewable energy.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Oceanbird Wing Sail Reaches for the Sky in Demonstration,https://maritime-executive.com/article/oceanbird-wing-sail-reaches-for-the-sky-in-demonstration,,28/08/2025 01:02:35,,"After more than three years of planning and research, Oceanbird unveiled its first prototype wing sail as the latest entry into the wind-assisted propulsion market. At an event in Sweden on August 25, the company said it is entering a new phase as it moves to commercial application, which will see the first sail installed aboard a vessel I 2026. Oceanbird, the company, was launched in 2021 as a partnership between Sweden’s Wallenius Lines and Alfa Laval with the mission of developing the concept for commercial application. Wallenius first previewed its concept of a sail-powered car carrier in 2020. A Swedish R&D project team, consisting of Wallenius Marine, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SSPA/RISE, and supported by Swedish Transport Administration, spent over three years refining the design, while the company also worked on the business concepts. “We believe that wind propulsion can grow into a significant new industry for Sweden — one that brings together engineering, sustainability, and maritime leadership,” said Magnus MackAldener, interim CEO & Head of R&D at Oceanbird, who moderated the inauguration. With the sail cutting the ribbon as it rose, MackAldener said they were ready to show it to the world and take orders. The prototype is installed at the Orsesund DryDocks in Landskrona, Sweden. It stands 40 meters (131 feet) and is 14 meters (46 feet) wide. It rose from the lowered position, unfolded its two segments, and demonstrated a full rotation. Oceanbird has installed a full control room at the yard for demonstrations and crew training. The sail has a high-strength steel core. The aerodynamic surface is a composite of glass fiber, and it is made from 370,000 recycled plastic bottles. They are calling it Wing 560. “We need pioneers who are willing to take risks, to innovate, and to lead the way into the green industrial transformation, and this is a great example of leadership. Oceanbird stands as proof of this success,” said Andreas Carlson, Sweden's Minister of Infrastructure and Housing at the inauguration. During the event, the sail was raised and unfurled and demonstrated its rotation (Oceanbird) The company highlights that it has undertaken extensive data simulations as well as physical tests. It conducted wind tunnel and model tests in open water and water tanks. It has also undertaken Lidar measurements. They report that a single wing can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 10 percent, and with the full installation, it will be possible to achieve up to a 90 percent reduction in emissions if all the factors are aligned. The next step is the assembly of a second, identical wing sail, which will be completed this fall at the yard. It will be installed on the Wallenius Wilhelmsen vessel Tirranna at the beginning of 2026. Built in 2009, the 30,000 dwt vessel with a capacity of 7,620 cars was fitted in July 2024 with the foundation for the wing sail. Preparations have been completed, and they will begin tests aboard the operational vessel. The tests come as wind-assisted propulsion continues to generate interest in the industry. Several concepts of rigid sails and wind rotors are being installed in an increasing number of commercial vessels. Operations have confirmed the expected fuel savings on vessels ranging from tankers to bulkers and RoRos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Italian Coast Guard Detains Boxship for Not Ensuring it Meets Emissions Reg,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-detains-boxship-for-not-ensuring-it-meets-emissions-reg,,27/08/2025 23:21:32,,"Guardia Costeria is reporting that it has detained a smaller containership after it was unable to determine that the vessel was in compliance with emissions regulations. The Mediterranean became an Emission Control Area (ECA) this year, while the Italian authority reports that it has detained ten ships this year for failing to comply with international regulations. The new situation arose in Genoa on August 21 when the Hansa Horneburg (23,644 dwt) arrived from the Italian port of Vado Ligure. The vessel, which is registered in Liberia and managed by Leonhardt & Blumberg of Germany, was built in China in 2007. It has a capacity for 1,732 TEU, The Italian authority reports that it conducted an inspection of the vessel, and although it is equipped with valid certifications, it could not determine full compliance with the regulation relating to the containment of nitrogen oxide (NOx). The authority says that components of the electric generators did not display compliance identification, and it was unable to determine if they complied with the NOx technical code. Guardia Costiera was unable to determine compliance with the emissions regulation (Guardia Costiera) Guardia Costeria reports it undertook a comprehensive inspection from the bridge to the engine room as well as crew areas. It also conducted a safety drill aboard the vessel. The Italians said that since compliance could not be ensured, the vessel was being detained. This year and last, the vessel underwent inspections in the United States and Peru without incident. The increased diligence comes as the Mediterranean ECA became official on May 1, 2025, the fifth ECA zone under the IMO’s regulations. The IMO highlighted that ships operating in the new ECA would be subject to strict mandatory measures to prevent, reduce, and control air pollution. The focus is on sulfur emissions and particulate matter. Ships operating in the Mediterranean must comply with stricter content limits than those set by the global standard (0.10 percent mass by mass (m/m) for sulfur, compared with 0.50 percent m/m allowed outside SOx ECAs). AIS signals show that the Hansa Horneburg remains in Genoa as of August 27. The Italian authority says it will be detained until the deficiencies are addressed under the supervision of the flag administration and the class society. It will also be required to pass a follow-up Port State Control Inspection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Hanwha Shipping Details Largest U.S. Commercial Vessel Order in 20 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hanwha-shipping-details-largest-u-s-commercial-vessel-order-in-20-years,,27/08/2025 21:55:11,,"Hanwha Shipping, the newly-launched U.S. shipping subsidiary of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, provided additional details on its shipbuilding plans, which it is calling the largest U.S. commercial vessel order in more than 20 years. The company looks to build out the U.S. Jones Act tanker fleet and launch the first modern U.S. LNG carriers for the international export market. “We are able to order these U.S.-made MR tankers because of Hanwha’s investment in building a world-class shipyard in Philadelphia,” said Ryan Lynch, President & CEO of Houston-based Hanwha Shipping. “Hanwha has made a long-term commitment to bringing cutting-edge technology from Korea to the Hanwha Philly Shipyard that will create thousands of good, advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States and spearhead the revitalization of America’s maritime industrial base.” The hallmark of the initiative is an order for 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers to be built in Philadelphia. The first tanker is expected to be delivered by early 2029, in what Hanwha Shipping terms “the highest-value commercial order seen at U.S. shipyards.” The MR vessels will be fitted to transport crude oil, refined petroleum, and chemical products, and will significantly expand the U.S. Jones Act fleet of U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed vessels operating between U.S. ports. Delivered in 2017, American Pride was the 28th ship built by the yard since it started commercial operations in 2000 (Philly Shipyard) The ships return the yard now known as Hanwha Philly Shipyard to its roots. Started in 2000 at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, the company, known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, started with contracts to build 46,000 to 50,000 dwt tankers. This included a dozen 600-foot MT46 Veteran-class tankers for Overseas Shipping Group and concluded in 2017 when it delivered American Pride, the fourth 50,000 dwt product tanker built for American Petroleum Tankers (APT), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. The yard delivered 24 tankers in addition to its six containership builds for Matson. As the only company in the world with significant shipbuilding operations in both Korea and the U.S., Hanwha reports it plans to build new MR tankers in the U.S. by transferring its advanced shipbuilding technologies, processes, and supply chains to Hanwha Philly Shipyard. At the same time, Hanwha Shipping also exercised an option to order a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, following its first order announced a month ago. They will be the first U.S.-ordered LNG carriers for the export market in almost 50 years and respond to the Trump plan that calls for requiring a portion of U.S. LNG exports to be transported on U.S. ships. The ships will be built via a joint construction model between Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of the U.S.-Korea partnership. The orders are an element of a $5 billion infrastructure plan announced yesterday for Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of South Korea’s commitment to supporting the growth of U.S. shipbuilding. After acquiring the shipyard at the end of 2024, the company plans to install two additional docks and three quays to increase annual capacity from less than two vessels to up to 20. Hanwha is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility as it targets work for LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long-term, naval vessels built at the U.S. shipyard. The Hanwha group quietly launched Hanwha Shipping, based in Texas, in April 2024. According to the company, it aims to take a leading position in the American shipping ecosystem by deploying next-generation digital technologies and advancing the resilience and robustness of America’s energy security and maritime industrial base.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Saildrone Secures Class Certification for its Largest Unmanned Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saildrone-secures-class-certificate-for-its-largest-unmanned-vessel,,27/08/2025 21:04:07,,"Saildrone, the California-based manufacturer of long-endurance ISR and survey drone boats, now operates the world's largest fully-classed unmanned surface vessel. In partnership with ABS, the company has obtained classification for its 20-meter Saildrone Surveyor after a rigorous review process. Among other benefits, the achievement allows the unmanned boats to operate in the waters of nations that require vessels to maintain a class certificate. ""The ABS class certification is . . . a signal to governments and the maritime industry that Saildrone USVs are mature, safe, tested, and ready for scale,"" said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone's founder and CEO. ""It’s been a very large investment and a multi-year process to achieve ABS class certification, but we are proud to be the first company in the world to do so."" ABS said in a statement that it has made a concerted effort to support unmanned vessel technology development. ""ABS and Saildrone are pioneering new frontiers, setting the pace for innovation. This step forward is a result of our investments in ABS’ technical capability and helping to ensure our Rules are able to support innovation with an unwavering focus on safety,"" said Patrick Ryan, ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. The two partners have been working together on certification for years. In 2023, ABS provided interim classification for Saildrone's 10-meter Voyager design, a popular choice for research and government customers like NOAA and the U.S. Navy. Saildrones have deployed everywhere from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic to the center of an Atlantic hurricane, collecting data for months at a time without human intervention - a key challenge for unmanned surface vessels. The company markets its vessels on a charter basis, and claims that its service model radically reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional vessels. Surveyor takes payload capabilities up a notch compared to previous models, and can support more technically demanding missions like subsea survey, acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) water column analysis and geotechnical data collection. It has been used commercially to map subsea cables for Meta, but it is built around the needs of the U.S. Navy: the large drone is built to ABS Light Warship standards, and is equipped with the kind of capability that the Navy needs to support persistent MDA and undersea warfare data collection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36

"After Sanctions and Ukrainian Attacks, Russian Oil Flows Shift",https://maritime-executive.com/article/after-sanctions-and-ukrainian-attacks-russian-oil-flows-shift,,28/08/2025 04:49:16,,"Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure are having complex effects on the nation's oil exports. Attacks on Russian refineries have sharply cut down domestic processing, freeing up more crude for export. At the same time, strikes on the Druzhba pipeline have hit cross-border exports to Russia's remaining customers in Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily cutting off export flows to Central Europe - and further raising the volume that needs to go to market by sea. Ukraine's refinery attacks have been picking up speed this month, and in recent weeks it has hit about 10 Russian oil refineries, temporarily taking out about 17 percent of all Russian refining capacity (about 1.1 million barrels per day). Fuel shortages, price hikes and regional schemes for fuel rationing have been reported within Russia, and the Kremlin has banned gasoline exports in an attempt to keep refined fuel supplies higher at home. The attacks are likely enabled by two new long-range weapons, the Batyar drone and the ""Flamingo"" cruise missile. Drones very much like the Batyar were photographed during Sunday's attack on the Novatek gas processing plant at Ust-Luga, a key Russian energy port near St. Petersburg. Ukraine's SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the strike, calling it an example of ""drone sanctions"" on Russian energy. Amidst the disruption, Russia's seaborne crude shipments fell to about 320,000 barrels per day in mid-August, according to Bloomberg - even though Reuters reports that Russia is trying to increase seaborne crude oil exports by 200,000 bpd, likely in search of a market for volumes that would normally be refined domestically or sold via the Druzhba pipeline. Reduced loadings at Ust-Luga accounted for most of the drop, and it is possible that Ukraine's strikes on the Druzhba pumping stations also affected deliveries to the loading port (via the northern branch of the pipeline). A second development could be discouraging seaborne export loadings at Russia's Baltic terminals. India, the second-biggest buyer of Russian crude, is buying about 500,000 barrels per day less than it was in June - likely because of EU sanctions on a key Indian refiner, as well as the punishing 25% extra tariff that the Trump administration has imposed on India over its Russian oil imports. However, China - the leading importer of Russian oil - has increased buying of these discounted barrels at the same time that India's imports have fallen. According to Kpler, Chinese refiners have picked up 15 extra cargoes of oil for October and November delivery, all from the western Russian ports that ordinarily ship to India.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16
"USACE Awards Contract to Build Strategic Harbor at Nome, Alaska",https://maritime-executive.com/article/usace-awards-contract-to-build-strategic-harbor-at-nome-alaska,,28/08/2025 04:34:52,,"After a slow start, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a contract to begin construction on a revamp of the harbor at Nome, Alaska, the first stage of a plan to turn it into a deepwater home port for the U.S. Coast Guard. At 64.5 degrees north, Nome is just shy of the Arctic Circle and just 100 nautical miles southeast of the Bering Strait. It has strategic relevance in a region with an increasing Russian and Chinese presence. But its utility is limited by its infrastructure: Currently, the port's outer basin depth limits traffic to vessels with a draft of no more than 18 feet - far too shallow for most commercial and military vessels. In 2011, the USACE launched a multiyear study on improvements to the port, and it recommended deepening the harbor to 28 feet. That study was paused in 2015 after the cancellation of Shell's Arctic drilling program, which removed the economic justification for creating a deepwater port on the Bering Sea. The process was rebooted in 2016, and four years later, the port published a plan to deepen the harbor's maximum depth to 40 feet and enlarge it with new causeways and piers. The estimated project cost came to about $660 million; once federal funding was in hand, the Corps went about soliciting bids for construction. All of the bids came in too high, the Corps said in 2024, and the agency decided to cancel its contract solicitation. This month, the Corps announced that it has awarded a $399 million contract to a sole bidder to pay for the first phase of the project only. This phase - funded by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - covers the construction of one 1,200-foot causeway, and will add one new berth face. The main dredging operation is scheduled next in Phase 2, which will be bid out separately. “A robust and efficient transportation hub at Nome is foundational to the long-term viability of surrounding communities in the region,” said Col. Jeffrey Palazzini, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Alaska District in a statement. “We are committed to assisting the City of Nome by providing a reliable solution that improves the port’s navigation efficiency.” Once completed, a 40-foot harbor basin would have the depth needed to accommodate the U.S. Coast Guard's interim icebreaker, USCGC Storis (ex name Aiviq), as well as its anticipated Polar Security Cutter heavy icebreaker. For years, the service's small icebreaking fleet has been homeported in Seattle, where there is access to a full-size shipyard and a marine industrial supply chain. But Seattle is 1,800 nautical miles away from the Bering Strait, and forces based there cannot react quickly to developments in the Arctic.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Corvus Energy Battery System Powers Latin America’s First Electric Tugboat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/corvus-energy-battery-system-powers-latin-america-s-first-electric-tugboat,,28/08/2025 03:48:31,,"[By: Corvus Energy] The first electric tugboat in Latin America, the result of a collaboration between the largest towage services operator in the Americas, SAAM, and Chilean national oil company, Enap, is powered by a lithium-ion marine battery system from Corvus Energy. Based on an exclusive design from naval architects Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and built by SANMAR Shipyards for SAAM, the battery-electric tug supports ship berthing and deberthing maneuvers in one of the southernmost terminals in the world—Puerto Chacabuco in the Aysén Region of Chile in South America. About the electric tugboat The battery-powered vessel, named “Trapananda” in honor of the Chilean Patagonia region where the tug operates, measures 25 meters in length, 13 meters in beam and boasts 70 tons of bollard pull capacity, enabling it to assist large vessels under challenging harbor conditions. Third electric tug in the SAAM fleet SAAM, including its division SAAM Towage, operates more than 200 tugboats around the Americas. Notably, the Trapananda is the third battery-electric tug to join the SAAM fleet. In May 2024, SAAM launched two electric tugboats in the Port of Vancouver in Canada, making SAAM among the first zero-emission tug operators in North America. All three tugs are RAL-designed, SANMAR Shipyards-built and equipped with a Corvus Energy battery system. Environmental and operational benefits According to SAAM, battery-powered tugboats are an important part of the Company’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which includes a goal to neutralize 65% of greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of their fleet through reduction and offsetting initiatives. (Source). Fully battery-powered operations produce zero emissions and are almost completely silent. This results in significant environmental benefits, including reduced carbon footprint and less noise pollution, both in port and underwater, protecting coastal communities and marine life alike. Compared to diesel-powered tugs, electric tugboats also offer operational advantages including reduced fuel and maintenance costs. After its first year operating electric tugs in Canada, SAAM reported its “carbon intensity index [had] fallen 72% compared to diesel-powered units with similar features, and a further 90% reduction is projected for the second year of operation. In addition, the electric tugs’ operating costs were reported to be 70% lower than its diesel-powered peers.” (Source). Corvus Energy involvement The Trapananda is equipped with a Corvus Orca ESS, the most installed marine energy storage system, used onboard over 700 maritime vessels worldwide. Like the SAAM electric-powered tugs operating in Vancouver, the Trapananda is outfitted with a 3,616-kWh capacity battery system. “We are proud to support SAAM, RAL and SANMAR by supplying the battery system for the first electric tugboat to operate in Latin America, as well as for the Vancouver-based tugs,” said Tor-Gunnar Hovig, Head of Region Americas at Corvus Energy. He adds, “SAAM is leading the way towards more sustainable port operations in the Americas and beyond with these RAL-designed, SANMAR-built tugs.” ""The arrival of the Trapananda is a turning point for our industry. It signals our decisive move toward cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operations. This project represents our vision for the future: we're developing solutions that not only assist and tow ships but also help mobilize a shift toward a truly sustainable logistics chain. We consider Corvus a strategic partner in this journey,” said Pablo Cáceres, Sustainability and Development Director of SAAM Towage.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Accordingly, 4 × 7S60ME-LGIA (Liquid Gas Injection Ammonia) dual-fuel engines will be delivered to an undisclosed Asian shipyard in connection with the construction of 4 × 9,100 CEU (Car Equivalent Unit) ‘Aurora’-class Pure Car/Truck Carriers (PCTCs). Everllence views the order as signalling a new era for clean propulsion within global shipping. The newbuildings are bound for Höegh Autoliners, the major PCTC operator and part of the Leif Höegh & Co. shipping company. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. will build the engines in South Korea. Sebjørn Dahl, Chief Operations Officer, Höegh Autoliners, said: ""The engines are the beating heart of our vessels, and we take it as a clear mark of confidence that Everllence has chosen us to install some of the world’s first two-stroke ammonia engines on our final four Aurora Class vessels. With nearly 100 years of industry experience, Höegh Autoliners is proud to be among the first companies selected to pioneer this important transition together with Everllence. This collaboration underscores their trust in us as a reliable frontrunner in the shift to zero-emission shipping. Reaching zero is a shared ambition, and Everllence plays a vital role in helping us realize our goal of operating our large PCTC vessels on zero-carbon fuels from 2027."" Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business – Everllence, said: “This order – one of several ammonia pilot-projects we have in China, Japan and South Korea – gives us encouragement that we are on the right path, as does the widespread industry interest in our progress. We have adopted a responsible, safety-first approach to developing this engine on account of ammonia’s particular risk-profile, and are confident that ammonia will ultimately become one of three major, alternative fuels in the market along with methanol and methane.” Christian Ludwig – Head of Two-Stroke Sales and Promotion – Everllence, said: “We have now been running our two-stroke ammonia test engine since 2023 and can confirm that the ME-LGIA’s combustion is right where we want it. Using the Diesel principle, the ME-LGIA engine concept has many of the same merits as our existing dual-fuel engines that already entered operation over a decade ago. Inspired by these engines, we are – among other innovations – using the same sealing-oil design for the fuel-booster injection valves as this has proven to be particularly important and efficient. By end-2026, we tentatively expect to have a small number of demonstration projects on the water to enable a commercial market introduction of the G50-, S60-, G60-, G70- and G80-bore ME-LGIA engines based on positive service experience.” Aurora class Höegh’s Aurora Class will be the largest and most environmentally friendly PCTC ever built, further accelerating Höegh Autoliners’ decarbonisation efforts and setting a new standard for more sustainable deep-sea transportation. Being the first in the PCTC segment to receive DNV’s ammonia-ready and methanol-ready notations, the Auroras will also be the first to be ready to operate zero-carbon ammonia propulsion with the main engine designed by Everllence.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Corvus Energy Battery System Powers Latin America’s First Electric Tugboat,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/corvus-energy-battery-system-powers-latin-america-s-first-electric-tugboat,,28/08/2025 03:48:31,,"[By: Corvus Energy] The first electric tugboat in Latin America, the result of a collaboration between the largest towage services operator in the Americas, SAAM, and Chilean national oil company, Enap, is powered by a lithium-ion marine battery system from Corvus Energy. Based on an exclusive design from naval architects Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and built by SANMAR Shipyards for SAAM, the battery-electric tug supports ship berthing and deberthing maneuvers in one of the southernmost terminals in the world—Puerto Chacabuco in the Aysén Region of Chile in South America. About the electric tugboat The battery-powered vessel, named “Trapananda” in honor of the Chilean Patagonia region where the tug operates, measures 25 meters in length, 13 meters in beam and boasts 70 tons of bollard pull capacity, enabling it to assist large vessels under challenging harbor conditions. Third electric tug in the SAAM fleet SAAM, including its division SAAM Towage, operates more than 200 tugboats around the Americas. Notably, the Trapananda is the third battery-electric tug to join the SAAM fleet. In May 2024, SAAM launched two electric tugboats in the Port of Vancouver in Canada, making SAAM among the first zero-emission tug operators in North America. All three tugs are RAL-designed, SANMAR Shipyards-built and equipped with a Corvus Energy battery system. Environmental and operational benefits According to SAAM, battery-powered tugboats are an important part of the Company’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which includes a goal to neutralize 65% of greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of their fleet through reduction and offsetting initiatives. (Source). Fully battery-powered operations produce zero emissions and are almost completely silent. This results in significant environmental benefits, including reduced carbon footprint and less noise pollution, both in port and underwater, protecting coastal communities and marine life alike. Compared to diesel-powered tugs, electric tugboats also offer operational advantages including reduced fuel and maintenance costs. After its first year operating electric tugs in Canada, SAAM reported its “carbon intensity index [had] fallen 72% compared to diesel-powered units with similar features, and a further 90% reduction is projected for the second year of operation. In addition, the electric tugs’ operating costs were reported to be 70% lower than its diesel-powered peers.” (Source). Corvus Energy involvement The Trapananda is equipped with a Corvus Orca ESS, the most installed marine energy storage system, used onboard over 700 maritime vessels worldwide. Like the SAAM electric-powered tugs operating in Vancouver, the Trapananda is outfitted with a 3,616-kWh capacity battery system. “We are proud to support SAAM, RAL and SANMAR by supplying the battery system for the first electric tugboat to operate in Latin America, as well as for the Vancouver-based tugs,” said Tor-Gunnar Hovig, Head of Region Americas at Corvus Energy. He adds, “SAAM is leading the way towards more sustainable port operations in the Americas and beyond with these RAL-designed, SANMAR-built tugs.” ""The arrival of the Trapananda is a turning point for our industry. It signals our decisive move toward cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operations. This project represents our vision for the future: we're developing solutions that not only assist and tow ships but also help mobilize a shift toward a truly sustainable logistics chain. We consider Corvus a strategic partner in this journey,” said Pablo Cáceres, Sustainability and Development Director of SAAM Towage.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

"Australian Police Find 900 Kilos of Meth in Container of ""Spring Rolls""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australian-police-find-900-kilos-of-meth-in-container-of-spring-rolls,,28/08/2025 03:19:26,,"Australian authorities have seized an exceptionally large shipment of amphetamine in a shipping container at a port in New South Wales, among the largest ever found in the region. On August 20, a team of Australian Border Force officers used intelligence profiling to pick a container for extra scrutiny at Port Botany. When they x-rayed the box, which was marked ""vegetable spring roll and more,"" they found that the ""and more"" part of the cargo declaration was accurate. Instead of spring rolls, they found hundreds of boxed rolls of shrink-wrap packaging, each roll filled with a core of white granules. The substance tested positive for amphetamine. In total, the concealed drugs amounted to about 900 kilos of amphetamine, worth a total of $40 million on the street in Australia. The ABF turned the matter over to the Australian Federal Police, which determined that the shipment was linked to a serious organized crime group with transnational ties. The drug consignment was added to a legimate shipment, authorities believe, without the cargo owners' knowledge. Courtesy AFP AFP carried out search warrants at a warehouse in Western Sydney and a house on the north side of Sydney Harbour, and the investigation continues. ""We use a sophisticated intelligence and risk assessment based approach, which has proven to yield significant results,"" ABF Superintendent Jared Leighton said. ""The scale of harm that would have been caused if these drugs landed in our community is unimaginable."" It is the latest in a long string of illegal stimulant busts at ports in Australia, which (per UNDOC) is the developed world's top per-capita consumer of cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine. Organized crime groups from China and South America have a hand in these illicit supply chains, attracted by the towering profits to be found on the Australian drug market. Smugglers continue to innovate: in January, AFP officers seized a cargo of ""pink cocaine,"" a club-drug mixture with ketamine and MDMA, and last October the agency caught a group that had hidden bricks of cocaine inside of two crated marine engines.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Höegh Autoliners Orders 1st Ammonia Engines for Pure Car & Truck Carriers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hoeegh-autoliners-orders-1st-ammonia-engines-for-pure-car-truck-carriers,,28/08/2025 02:55:45,,"[By: Everllence] In a major leap for maritime decarbonisation, Höegh Autoliners has placed a landmark order for ammonia-burning Everllence B&W ME-LGIA engines. Accordingly, 4 × 7S60ME-LGIA (Liquid Gas Injection Ammonia) dual-fuel engines will be delivered to an undisclosed Asian shipyard in connection with the construction of 4 × 9,100 CEU (Car Equivalent Unit) ‘Aurora’-class Pure Car/Truck Carriers (PCTCs). Everllence views the order as signalling a new era for clean propulsion within global shipping. The newbuildings are bound for Höegh Autoliners, the major PCTC operator and part of the Leif Höegh & Co. shipping company. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. will build the engines in South Korea. Sebjørn Dahl, Chief Operations Officer, Höegh Autoliners, said: ""The engines are the beating heart of our vessels, and we take it as a clear mark of confidence that Everllence has chosen us to install some of the world’s first two-stroke ammonia engines on our final four Aurora Class vessels. With nearly 100 years of industry experience, Höegh Autoliners is proud to be among the first companies selected to pioneer this important transition together with Everllence. This collaboration underscores their trust in us as a reliable frontrunner in the shift to zero-emission shipping. Reaching zero is a shared ambition, and Everllence plays a vital role in helping us realize our goal of operating our large PCTC vessels on zero-carbon fuels from 2027."" Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business – Everllence, said: “This order – one of several ammonia pilot-projects we have in China, Japan and South Korea – gives us encouragement that we are on the right path, as does the widespread industry interest in our progress. We have adopted a responsible, safety-first approach to developing this engine on account of ammonia’s particular risk-profile, and are confident that ammonia will ultimately become one of three major, alternative fuels in the market along with methanol and methane.” Christian Ludwig – Head of Two-Stroke Sales and Promotion – Everllence, said: “We have now been running our two-stroke ammonia test engine since 2023 and can confirm that the ME-LGIA’s combustion is right where we want it. Using the Diesel principle, the ME-LGIA engine concept has many of the same merits as our existing dual-fuel engines that already entered operation over a decade ago. Inspired by these engines, we are – among other innovations – using the same sealing-oil design for the fuel-booster injection valves as this has proven to be particularly important and efficient. By end-2026, we tentatively expect to have a small number of demonstration projects on the water to enable a commercial market introduction of the G50-, S60-, G60-, G70- and G80-bore ME-LGIA engines based on positive service experience.” Aurora class Höegh’s Aurora Class will be the largest and most environmentally friendly PCTC ever built, further accelerating Höegh Autoliners’ decarbonisation efforts and setting a new standard for more sustainable deep-sea transportation. Being the first in the PCTC segment to receive DNV’s ammonia-ready and methanol-ready notations, the Auroras will also be the first to be ready to operate zero-carbon ammonia propulsion with the main engine designed by Everllence.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ship Manager Fined $2M for MARPOL Offense After Crew Provides Evidence,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ship-manager-fined-2m-for-marpol-offense-after-crew-provides-evidence,,28/08/2025 02:33:51,,"U.S. officials are reporting yet another case in which a MARPOL violation was discovered after a crewmember turned over evidence to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Department of Justice reported on August 25 that V.Ships Norway pleaded guilty to the violation and was sentenced to pay a $2 million fine. “Dumping oil-contaminated waste into the waters around our ports and coasts violates the law and poses an unnecessary health and environmental hazard,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “The crew took pains to hide their illegal activity by knowingly keeping inaccurate records. We will not turn a blind eye to this kind of irresponsible and fraudulent activity.” DOJ reports that between February 2022 and August 2022, a hose was connected between the incinerator waste oil tank and the sewage holding tank on the product tanker Swift Winchester (46,000 dwt). The vessel was at the time operating under the Marshall Islands flag and owned by Winchester Shipping and managed by V. Ships. The hose was a type of “magic pipe” that allowed oily waste to transfer into the sewage holding tank and then to be discharged directly into the sea, bypassing required pollution prevention equipment. A low-ranking engine crewmember reported this to a superintendent at V.Ships. The superintendent investigated the matter and discovered what appeared to be oil in the sewage tank. DOJ acknowledges that V.Ships dismissed the Chief Engineer. In August 2022, the new Chief Engineer ordered the engine crew to clean the Oil Water Separator (OWS) filter. The engine crew took the filter onto the deck and hosed it down with a degreaser, and the oily waste washed directly overboard through a scupper. Coast Guard members from the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur conducted an examination of the vessel. While they were in the engine room, a crewmember disclosed the discharges and provided photographic and video evidence documenting the illegal discharges. The M/T Swift Winchester was charged with entering Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 25, 2022, and Port Arthur, Texas, on September 7, 2022, with a knowingly falsified Oil Record Book. V.Ships admitted that oily bilge water and oily waste were discharged from the vessel and that the discharges were omitted from the Oil Record Book.

NATO Patrol Aircraft Chase Russian Sub as U.S. Carrier Operates off Norway,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nato-patrol-aircraft-chase-russian-sub-as-u-s-carrier-operates-off-norway,,28/08/2025 02:11:29,,"A substantial share of the NATO maritime surveillance aircraft fleet has been engaged in tracking a Russian submarine off the coast of Norway. The movements of Russia's attack subs are of interest every day, but this one has attracted extra attention because it is in the same region as the carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is currently operating alongside Norwegian allied forces in the North Sea. According to the UK's Daily Express, P-8 surveillance aircraft from the UK, the U.S. and Norway have saturated a search area near the Ford Carrier Strike Group since last week. More than two dozen sorties have been flown so far, including at least eight flown by the UK's Royal Air Force. Some of the capacity originated from an airbase in Sicily, on the other side of Europe, suggesting a high priority for diverting assets to this mission. A UK defense source told The Sun that the operation was ""highly unusual,"" and several British sources called it a show of force from NATO. “It is telling Russia: ‘We see you,'” former Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe told the outlet. The Barents Observer has reported that three Yasen-class Russian attack subs departed the pens at Severomorsk earlier this week, based on satellite imagery. USS Gerald R. Ford and her escorts departed the Mediterranean earlier this month and transited through the English Channel to reach the North Sea. On arrival, the Ford strike group met up with Norwegian units to conduct joint drills. The exercise is part of Ford's deployment to the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations, and is intended to demonstrate the ""U.S. Navy's ironclad commitment to the stability and security of the European theater."" Separately, Russian fighters intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8A over the Black Sea on Wednesday, and the pilots filmed an interaction with the U.S. Navy plane. This particular P-8 had extended its rarely-spotted AESA radar, the Advanced Airborne Sensor pod - a powerful air and surface search device. The P-8 was on a mission to patrol the waters off Novorossiysk, the Russian Navy's bastion in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea.

Japan Proposes Changes in Wind Energy Terms as Mitsubishi Withdraws,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/japan-proposes-changes-in-wind-energy-terms-as-mitsubishi-withdraws,,28/08/2025 02:08:37,,"The Japanese government is looking for means to revitalize its lagging efforts to develop offshore wind energy. The move comes as Mitsubishi, which in a consortium had won the first large auction, confirmed it has decided not to proceed with three wind farms. Japan’s offshore wind energy sector has been slow to start and faces significant challenges due to the offshore topography. There are limited near-shore positions for fixed-bottom wind turbines. To achieve the government’s goals of 45 GW by 2040, the industry will have to develop floating wind technology. To date, Japan has developed only a few small near-shore wind farms with a total installed capacity of approximately 300 MW. The consortium with Mitsubishi won in December the first large-scale auctions that consisted of three offshore sites near Akita on the northwest of Honshu in the Sea of Japan and Chiba, which is approximately 25 miles from Tokyo. The two sites on the Sea of Japan called for 819 MW and 478.8 MW, while the site near Tokyo would have been 390 MW, and all were fixed-bottom projects. Work was expected to start this year and next, and collectively they called for nearly 1.7 GW. Mitsubishi announced a review of the projects in February, citing increasing costs and changed economics, while reporting it would record a $354 million charge. The company, however, initially denied media reports earlier this week that indicated that the projects were being canceled. However, in a statement issued on August 27, Mitsubishi confirmed it has decided not to proceed with the development of the projects. The company said that the business environment for offshore wind power has changed worldwide due to factors such as tight supply, inflation, exchange rates, and rising interest rates, since the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. It called the changes unexpected and said that while it continues to recognize the role of renewable energy, it would not be proceeding with the three projects. The group was involved in the manufacture of wind turbine generators since 1982, but sold its joint venture to Vestas in 2020. “To adapt to these unexpected changes, we have been pursuing various options, including reassessment of costs, project schedule, and revenue. However, after discussions among the partners, we have determined that establishing a viable business plan is not feasible given the current conditions,” the company said in its statement. Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Yoji Muto, called the decision “deeply regrettable.” He said it would undermine trust in the industry. The Ministry, along with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, had just completed an expert panel review of the industry. It submitted a proposal to the government calling for revising the terms of the leases, adding a provision so that companies could apply for an additional 10 years. The leases in the first three rounds of auctions in Japan provided a 30-year total term and required removal and rebidding at the end of the term. Experts point out that companies would have approximately 20 years of operation after the time required for permitting and construction. The panel said adding 10 years would give companies more time to improve cash flow, increase electricity sales, and provide for earlier capital recovery. They believe this will also attract a broader range of investors. They proposed changing the terms for future auctions, but did not address making the provision for the 10-year extension available for the existing leases. The ministry said it plans to restage the auctions for the leases that Mitsubishi is not proceeding with. In Europe, they have also begun to extend wind leases. Denmark in June issued the first extension for an offshore wind lease. It followed with two more agreements later that same month, also highlighting that the extended term would improve the economics of some of its oldest operating wind farms while also maintaining the flow of renewable energy.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Oceanbird Wing Sail Reaches for the Sky in Demonstration,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/oceanbird-wing-sail-reaches-for-the-sky-in-demonstration,,28/08/2025 01:02:35,,"After more than three years of planning and research, Oceanbird unveiled its first prototype wing sail as the latest entry into the wind-assisted propulsion market. At an event in Sweden on August 25, the company said it is entering a new phase as it moves to commercial application, which will see the first sail installed aboard a vessel I 2026. Oceanbird, the company, was launched in 2021 as a partnership between Sweden’s Wallenius Lines and Alfa Laval with the mission of developing the concept for commercial application. Wallenius first previewed its concept of a sail-powered car carrier in 2020. A Swedish R&D project team, consisting of Wallenius Marine, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SSPA/RISE, and supported by Swedish Transport Administration, spent over three years refining the design, while the company also worked on the business concepts. “We believe that wind propulsion can grow into a significant new industry for Sweden — one that brings together engineering, sustainability, and maritime leadership,” said Magnus MackAldener, interim CEO & Head of R&D at Oceanbird, who moderated the inauguration. With the sail cutting the ribbon as it rose, MackAldener said they were ready to show it to the world and take orders. The prototype is installed at the Orsesund DryDocks in Landskrona, Sweden. It stands 40 meters (131 feet) and is 14 meters (46 feet) wide. It rose from the lowered position, unfolded its two segments, and demonstrated a full rotation. Oceanbird has installed a full control room at the yard for demonstrations and crew training. The sail has a high-strength steel core. The aerodynamic surface is a composite of glass fiber, and it is made from 370,000 recycled plastic bottles. They are calling it Wing 560. “We need pioneers who are willing to take risks, to innovate, and to lead the way into the green industrial transformation, and this is a great example of leadership. Oceanbird stands as proof of this success,” said Andreas Carlson, Sweden's Minister of Infrastructure and Housing at the inauguration. During the event, the sail was raised and unfurled and demonstrated its rotation (Oceanbird) The company highlights that it has undertaken extensive data simulations as well as physical tests. It conducted wind tunnel and model tests in open water and water tanks. It has also undertaken Lidar measurements. They report that a single wing can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 10 percent, and with the full installation, it will be possible to achieve up to a 90 percent reduction in emissions if all the factors are aligned. The next step is the assembly of a second, identical wing sail, which will be completed this fall at the yard. It will be installed on the Wallenius Wilhelmsen vessel Tirranna at the beginning of 2026. Built in 2009, the 30,000 dwt vessel with a capacity of 7,620 cars was fitted in July 2024 with the foundation for the wing sail. Preparations have been completed, and they will begin tests aboard the operational vessel. The tests come as wind-assisted propulsion continues to generate interest in the industry. Several concepts of rigid sails and wind rotors are being installed in an increasing number of commercial vessels. Operations have confirmed the expected fuel savings on vessels ranging from tankers to bulkers and RoRos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

The Mediterranean became an Emission Control Area (ECA) this year, while the Italian authority reports that it has detained ten ships this year for failing to comply with international regulations. The new situation arose in Genoa on August 21 when the Hansa Horneburg (23,644 dwt) arrived from the Italian port of Vado Ligure. The vessel, which is registered in Liberia and managed by Leonhardt & Blumberg of Germany, was built in China in 2007. It has a capacity for 1,732 TEU, The Italian authority reports that it conducted an inspection of the vessel, and although it is equipped with valid certifications, it could not determine full compliance with the regulation relating to the containment of nitrogen oxide (NOx). The authority says that components of the electric generators did not display compliance identification, and it was unable to determine if they complied with the NOx technical code. Guardia Costiera was unable to determine compliance with the emissions regulation (Guardia Costiera) Guardia Costeria reports it undertook a comprehensive inspection from the bridge to the engine room as well as crew areas. It also conducted a safety drill aboard the vessel. The Italians said that since compliance could not be ensured, the vessel was being detained. This year and last, the vessel underwent inspections in the United States and Peru without incident. The increased diligence comes as the Mediterranean ECA became official on May 1, 2025, the fifth ECA zone under the IMO’s regulations. The IMO highlighted that ships operating in the new ECA would be subject to strict mandatory measures to prevent, reduce, and control air pollution. The focus is on sulfur emissions and particulate matter. Ships operating in the Mediterranean must comply with stricter content limits than those set by the global standard (0.10 percent mass by mass (m/m) for sulfur, compared with 0.50 percent m/m allowed outside SOx ECAs). AIS signals show that the Hansa Horneburg remains in Genoa as of August 27. The Italian authority says it will be detained until the deficiencies are addressed under the supervision of the flag administration and the class society. It will also be required to pass a follow-up Port State Control Inspection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

The company looks to build out the U.S. Jones Act tanker fleet and launch the first modern U.S. LNG carriers for the international export market. “We are able to order these U.S.-made MR tankers because of Hanwha’s investment in building a world-class shipyard in Philadelphia,” said Ryan Lynch, President & CEO of Houston-based Hanwha Shipping. “Hanwha has made a long-term commitment to bringing cutting-edge technology from Korea to the Hanwha Philly Shipyard that will create thousands of good, advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States and spearhead the revitalization of America’s maritime industrial base.” The hallmark of the initiative is an order for 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers to be built in Philadelphia. The first tanker is expected to be delivered by early 2029, in what Hanwha Shipping terms “the highest-value commercial order seen at U.S. shipyards.” The MR vessels will be fitted to transport crude oil, refined petroleum, and chemical products, and will significantly expand the U.S. Jones Act fleet of U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed vessels operating between U.S. ports. Delivered in 2017, American Pride was the 28th ship built by the yard since it started commercial operations in 2000 (Philly Shipyard) The ships return the yard now known as Hanwha Philly Shipyard to its roots. Started in 2000 at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, the company, known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, started with contracts to build 46,000 to 50,000 dwt tankers. This included a dozen 600-foot MT46 Veteran-class tankers for Overseas Shipping Group and concluded in 2017 when it delivered American Pride, the fourth 50,000 dwt product tanker built for American Petroleum Tankers (APT), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. The yard delivered 24 tankers in addition to its six containership builds for Matson. As the only company in the world with significant shipbuilding operations in both Korea and the U.S., Hanwha reports it plans to build new MR tankers in the U.S. by transferring its advanced shipbuilding technologies, processes, and supply chains to Hanwha Philly Shipyard. At the same time, Hanwha Shipping also exercised an option to order a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, following its first order announced a month ago. They will be the first U.S.-ordered LNG carriers for the export market in almost 50 years and respond to the Trump plan that calls for requiring a portion of U.S. LNG exports to be transported on U.S. ships. The ships will be built via a joint construction model between Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of the U.S.-Korea partnership. The orders are an element of a $5 billion infrastructure plan announced yesterday for Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of South Korea’s commitment to supporting the growth of U.S. shipbuilding. After acquiring the shipyard at the end of 2024, the company plans to install two additional docks and three quays to increase annual capacity from less than two vessels to up to 20. Hanwha is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility as it targets work for LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long-term, naval vessels built at the U.S. shipyard. The Hanwha group quietly launched Hanwha Shipping, based in Texas, in April 2024. According to the company, it aims to take a leading position in the American shipping ecosystem by deploying next-generation digital technologies and advancing the resilience and robustness of America’s energy security and maritime industrial base.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Saildrone Secures Class Certification for its Largest Unmanned Vessel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saildrone-secures-class-certificate-for-its-largest-unmanned-vessel,,27/08/2025 21:04:07,,"Saildrone, the California-based manufacturer of long-endurance ISR and survey drone boats, now operates the world's largest fully-classed unmanned surface vessel. In partnership with ABS, the company has obtained classification for its 20-meter Saildrone Surveyor after a rigorous review process. Among other benefits, the achievement allows the unmanned boats to operate in the waters of nations that require vessels to maintain a class certificate. ""The ABS class certification is . . . a signal to governments and the maritime industry that Saildrone USVs are mature, safe, tested, and ready for scale,"" said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone's founder and CEO. ""It’s been a very large investment and a multi-year process to achieve ABS class certification, but we are proud to be the first company in the world to do so."" ABS said in a statement that it has made a concerted effort to support unmanned vessel technology development. ""ABS and Saildrone are pioneering new frontiers, setting the pace for innovation. This step forward is a result of our investments in ABS’ technical capability and helping to ensure our Rules are able to support innovation with an unwavering focus on safety,"" said Patrick Ryan, ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. The two partners have been working together on certification for years. In 2023, ABS provided interim classification for Saildrone's 10-meter Voyager design, a popular choice for research and government customers like NOAA and the U.S. Navy. Saildrones have deployed everywhere from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic to the center of an Atlantic hurricane, collecting data for months at a time without human intervention - a key challenge for unmanned surface vessels. The company markets its vessels on a charter basis, and claims that its service model radically reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional vessels. Surveyor takes payload capabilities up a notch compared to previous models, and can support more technically demanding missions like subsea survey, acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) water column analysis and geotechnical data collection. It has been used commercially to map subsea cables for Meta, but it is built around the needs of the U.S. Navy: the large drone is built to ABS Light Warship standards, and is equipped with the kind of capability that the Navy needs to support persistent MDA and undersea warfare data collection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Typhoon Drives Cargo Ship Ashore and Causes Widespread Damage in Vietnam,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/typhoon-drives-cargo-ship-ashore-and-causes-widespread-damage-in-vietnam,,27/08/2025 20:29:44,,"Vietnamese officials are reporting widespread damage as the 14th named storm of the 2025 season, Typhoon Kajiki, slammed ashore Monday night into Tuesday morning, August 25-26. A large cargo ship was driven onto the shore, and at least four people have died from injuries and flooding during the powerful storm. The storm was traveling west across the Pacific, encountering the Philippines as a tropical depression and dropping large amounts of rain on portions of China. By the time it reached Vietnam, it had strengthened with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to NASA. Other parts of Vietnam were reporting sustained winds of 82 mph. Vietnam had been preparing for the storm. At least half a million people had been evacuated before Kajiki reached the coastline. The wood chip carrier Thanh Thanh Dat 99 (22,300 dwt) had been anchored at the northern port of Ninh Binh, but on the evening of August 25, during a lull ahead of the storm attempted to sail south toward Nghi Son port. The ship, which is 495 feet (151 meters) in length, was traveling only with ballast as it was due to load in Nghi Son. The captain reported that by the time they reached the anchorage, the winds and waves were too strong to drop anchor. They were attempting to hold the ship in position as the storm approached. At 11:30 p.m. local time on August 25, they notified the authorities that the vessel was drifting from a position approximately two nautical miles offshore. Two hours later, they reported that the ship was dangerously close to shore. The cargo ship came to rest approximately 70 to 100 meters (230 to 325 feet) from shore. The authorities reported the ship was stable and that the crew was uninjured. They will explore refloating the ship after the storm has passed. The country is continuing to deal with widespread flooding and damage to structures. At least 13 people were reported injured in addition to the four confirmed deaths. The storm continued west, weakening with winds of 38 mph as it reached the border with Laos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
HD Hyundai to Merge Ulsan Shipyards to Expand Defense and Commercial Work,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-to-merge-ulsan-shipyards-to-expand-defense-and-commercial-work,,27/08/2025 19:52:01,,"HD Hyundai, which is already South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, announced plans to reorganize by merging its shipbuilding operations in Ulsan to realize opportunities both in naval shipbuilding and repair, and the South Korean MASGA (Make America Shipbuilding Great Again) initiative. The company said that it looks to take a leadership role in the South Korean program following the meeting earlier this week between the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, and Donald Trump, in which South Korea committed to investing at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding and other key industries. As part of the agreement, the company announced a new partnership with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank to pursue a maritime investment strategy. Under the terms of the proposed merger, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries will acquire the mid-sized operation HD Hyundai Mipo with HHI as the surviving company. HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding holding company, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, owns 74 percent of HHI and 42 percent of Mipo, and after the merger will have a 69 percent position in the combined company. HHI says the merger is an effective response to future changes in the shipbuilding industry and points to the opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs and structure by integrating its systems. Media reports are highlighting that China recently consolidated its two large shipbuilding companies and that Japan’s two largest shipbuilders have also reorganized. In the first seven months of 2025, HD KSOE reported that it booked orders for a total of 82 ships worth $11.22 billion. It has achieved 62 percent of the annual order target of $18.05 billion for 2025. HHI specializes in larger vessels, including LNG carriers and containerships, while Mipo is considered a medium-sized operation building containerships, chemical tankers, and vehicle carriers. One of the key markets the combined company will be targeting is defense shipbuilding, which HD Hyundai highlighted to investors as a rapidly growing segment as countries expand their investments. HHI reports it has built 106 naval vessels, more than any other domestic shipbuilder. It has experience with destroyers, frigates, submarines, and patrol boats, and looks to expand both internationally and specifically with the United States as part of the MASGA program. “We will increase our competitiveness in the K shipbuilding and defense sectors by reorganizing the shipbuilding business,” the company told investors. It said the target is to grow defense revenues to $7.2 billion annually by 2035. It also looks to expand its entry into the repair business. The company recently won its first MRO contract from the U.S. for the overhaul of a U.S. Military Sealift vessel, USNS Alan Shepard, a 41,000-ton displacement Lewis and Clark class dry cargo and ammunition vessel. As part of MASGA, they believe this business segment will grow rapidly. They also look to expand their expertise in specialty ships, pointing to the opportunity for icebreakers due to the rise in Arctic development. South Korea previously announced that it plans to launch an Arctic shipping initiative and recently ordered a new Arctic research vessel. The combined company will also accelerate its focus on green shipping. They will consolidate the R&D and design capabilities of the two shipbuilders. Mipo will also provide additional capacity to the combined company, as reports are that it is currently operating at a rate of 45 ships but has a capacity to reach 70 ships annually. The combined company plans to launch by December a new overseas investment holding company to be based in Singapore. It will manage the operations of the shipyards in Vietnam and the newly launching yard in the Philippines, as well a the recently acquired tank and crane manufacturer in Vietnam that it has agreed to acquire from Doosan. HD Hyundai has also been exploring additional overseas operations, including possibly a shipyard in Morocco and Egypt, and has formed new relationships in the United States.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Navy Officer Takes the Helm at Central Command,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/navy-officer-takes-the-helm-at-central-command,,27/08/2025 06:14:37,,"Command of United States Central Command, whose area of responsibility stretches through 21 countries from Israel in the West, across the Middle East, to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the East, changed earlier this month. General Michael Kurilla, in post since April 2022 and a combat-seasoned infantry officer, handed over to Admiral Brad Cooper. A change in command often signals a change in emphasis. Admiral Cooper hitherto has commanded the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59), the Ticonderoga Class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG 64) at ship level, and at fleet level Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Expeditionary Strike Group 7 in Okinawa, US Naval Forces Korea and the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. He has moved up from being Deputy Commander CENTCOM. He thus has intimate experience of the Middle East region acquired over many years, has recently overseen anti-Houthi operations in the Red Sea and understands in depth the character of threats posed by Iran’s regional activities. Despite priorities being accorded to the threat posed by China, conflicts in the Middle East continue to demand Department of Defense attention, notwithstanding a desire to pivot away from never-ending issues. Those selected for command at Theatre level qualify on the basis of their political acumen as well as their joint command experience, so the service background of Admiral Cooper should not be of immediate relevance in tackling these recurring Middle Eastern issues. Indeed, in similar circumstances, new commanders normally endeavor to compensate for perceived loyalty to their own parent service by focusing particularly hard on the requirements of other services. Admiral Cooper is likely to be no different. However, over time, Admiral Cooper’s substantial naval experience in the Middle East is likely to influence his approach to operational issues as they arise. Admiral Cooper has an academic interest in intelligence matters, and was instrumental in fielding Task Force 59, a fleet of unmanned surveillance drones able to improve surveillance of the Iranian coastline and other maritime bottlenecks. He is likely, once he has settled in to his new and wider responsibilities, to have particular ideas on how to improve the effectiveness of naval operations in his area of command, using this background, and now has increased influence on Congressional budgeting to fund such initiatives. However, he will have to overcome resistance and competition from Indo-Pacific Command, which will complain about the diversion of resources and heavy expenditure of missiles in recent Middle East engagements. Having an officer with this particular experience-set in charge of CENTCOM should in due course have significant impact on operations countering malign Iranian and Houthi maritime activities - but in ways which will not necessarily be advertised in advance. Given Admiral Cooper’s track record, these are likely to include an emphasis on technical innovation, alongside less reliance on long-term ground presences and a greater exploitation of the flexibility of naval power projection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Trump Doubles Tariffs on India Over Russian Oil Imports,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-doubles-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-imports,,27/08/2025 06:04:58,,"Following through on its pledge to penalize India for buying Russian oil, the Trump administration has raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. The decision doubles the effective tariff rate on Indian exports, applying more pressure on New Delhi to negotiate trade terms with Washington. Export manufacturers in India have already begun laying off staff in anticipation of reduced American demand for the country's big export categories, like diamonds, jewelry, clothing and farmed shrimp. The 50 percent tariff is exceptionally high compared with the 15 percent base levy for Japan, South Korea and the EU, or even the 20 percent rate negotiated by neighboring Bangladesh; it compares to the rate for India's major-power rival, China, which currently faces a 55 percent tariff. The tariff hike puts Indian exporters in a bind, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded with stimulus measures. He has promised to cut taxes to offset loss of income, and has doubled down on his message of ""Make in India"" self-reliance. ""Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties - we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches,"" Modi said at an address in Delhi. Modi has also scheduled an unusual trip to China, his first since 2018. India and China have faced off along their mountainous border region for years, and relations have been chilly since a major clash in 2020. But both face major trade challenges with Washington, and Modi - a key U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific - has decided to fly to Beijing for a security summit attended by leaders from Pakistan, Iran, Russia and other nations. Chinese President Xi Jinping will preside over the gathering this weekend. ""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" Modi said last week, emphasizing normalization. China has undergone a tariff roller-coaster even more pronounced than India's, ranging from 20 percent in February to 125 percent in May, then back down to the current level of 55 percent. On Monday, President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports up again to 200 percent if Beijing does not allow the resumption of shipments of rare-earth magnets, critically needed for U.S. defense applications. A tariff ""truce"" between the two sides is in effect until November, and China has dispatched top negotiator Li Chenggang to Washington this week to continue talks towards a permanent agreement, according to the Wall Street Journal.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Mazagon Dock and Indian Coast Guard Place Record High-Speed Order,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mazagon-dock-and-indian-coast-guard-place-record-high-speed-order,,27/08/2025 04:35:55,,"[By: Everllence] Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., based in Mumbai, India, has placed an order for 14 × 3 × 16V175D-MM high-speed engines from Everllence. The engines will power 14 Fast Patrol Vessels (FPVs) currently under construction for the Indian Coast Guard. The engines are all rated at 2,960 kW and scheduled for delivery from December 2025 to December 2027. The FPVs will be equipped with waterjet propulsion systems and are designed to reach speeds exceeding 33 knots. They will be deployed for coastal surveillance, fisheries protection, search-and-rescue operations, and can also be used for military missions in times of crisis. Ben Andres, Head of Sales at Everllence, said: “This project marks a major milestone for Everllence as we enter the Indian Coast Guard market – a highly strategic and demanding customer - and extend our long partnership with Mazagon Dock with another significant order. We are proud to be part of this collaboration, which not only strengthens our presence in the region but also highlights the trust placed in our 175D engine.” Waldemar Wiesner, Vice President, Head of Marine and PrimeServ Marine & Power, Middle-East/Africa at Everllence, said: “The 175D proved to be the right technical choice for this project. Close collaboration with Mazagon Dock’s technical and commercial teams was key to securing this important contract. We are thankful to the Indian Coast Guard for its timely scrutiny of technical documents and technical clearance.” The new order follows closely on the heels of another major, Indian order that Everllence won in April 2025, that time from the Indian Navy when Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. ordered complete propulsion packages from Everllence for five newbuild Fleet Support Ships. Each scope of supply features 2 × 20V32/44CR engines. About the 175D engine Everllence developed the 175D engine range to supplement and complete its product portfolio in the maritime sector. Available in three variants of 12-, 16- and 20-cylinders, the engine is available with an output ranging from 1,500 to 4,400 Kilowatts and is optimised for propelling ferries, offshore support ships, tugs and other working vessels. Other market areas, such as superyachts, planing yachts and naval marine applications are also served by additional engine variants. The 175D is also an extremely eco-friendly engine, having been designed from the outset for low fuel-consumption, coupled with compliance to the latest exhaust-gas emission standards and considering as well future-fuel requirements where it is already cleared for operation on biofuels such as FAME and HVO.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Owners of Ex-Bouchard ATB Fleet Tussle in Court, Sidelining Vessels",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/owners-of-ex-bouchard-atb-fleet-tussle-in-court-sidelining-vessels,,27/08/2025 04:19:02,,"Pennantia, the JV company that acquired eight ATBs out of the former Bouchard fleet, has paused its operations amidst a legal fight between its majority owner and its operator. One of the vessels has been arrested in Panama on a lien filed by the operator, and another of the idled ATBs may have attracted Coast Guard attention over manning levels, according to court filings. The shipowning JV, Pennantia, is majority-owned by Contrarian Capital, with minority owner Rose Cay handling maritime operations under contract (the Rose Cay name is the fleet's operating brand). Rose Cay alleges that Pennantia - controlled by Contrarian Capital - has stopped paying in full for operating expenses, and it has suspended shipmanagement services while demanding repayment. In response, Pennantia sued Rose Cay and accused it of trying to shut down operations on a false pretext in order to scuttle the pending sale of the ATB fleet. Both parties deny each others' allegations. The fallout is a new speed bump for the remnants of the Bouchard empire. The Pennantia partnership bought eight ATBs from the former Bouchard Transportation fleet when Bouchard was dissolved and its assets split up in 2021. Pennantia's acquisition includes younger Jones Act vessels, ranging from 4,000-horsepower tugs up to the tanker-sized ex-Kim M. Bouchard / RCM 270. After purchase, the fleet was initially operated by Foss under contract, but Rose Cay took over management in 2022. At that time, it took crewing and operations under its own umbrella and subcontracted these tasks to a new subsidiary, named Dove Cay LLC. In December 2024, Rose Cay claimed that Pennantia owed about $9.5 million in unpaid expenses and interest to Dove Cay, and in February it escalated with a declaration that Pennantia was in default. (Pennantia denies these claims.) Dove Cay then filed liens against the entire Pennantia fleet totaling about $29 million, including $13 million for repayment of a loan. In response, Pennantia called Rose Cay's claims ""fabricated"" and last month it filed for a court injunction to prevent Rose Cay and Dove Cay from idling the fleet or pursuing their maritime liens. In an order signed on August 18, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Pennantia's motion for an injunction in the case, allowing Dove Cay to pursue its liens against the vessels while litigation continues. The judge also allowed Rose Cay to terminate its shipmanagement contract with Pennantia, on the understanding that minimum safety and manning requirements would continue to be met. The two parties are in mediation and have discussed possible terms for a settlement; in the meantime, AIS data shows that the firm's active tugs are all at berth or at anchor in New York, Panama and Port Arthur.

Hanwha Ocean Announces $5 Billion Investment in Philly Shipyard,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/third-training-ship-christened-as-backdrop-for-us-south-korea-shipbuilding,,27/08/2025 03:49:27,,"The third U.S. training ship, State of Maine, was christened on Tuesday, August 26, in a ceremony designed to highlight the emerging partnership between the United States and South Korea for shipbuilding. The event was rescheduled a week so that it could coincide with the visit to the United States by South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, and follows one day after he met with Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. The South Korean President toured the Philadelphia shipyard that was acquired by Hanwha Ocean for approximately $100 million at the end of 2024. The company’s acquisition pre-dated the Trump initiative to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding and was seen as an entry into the U.S. naval market. The company looks to expand its work for the U.S. Navy and government ships, such as the training ships, and now to leverage the opportunities under the Trump programs. Hanwha aims to produce LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long term, naval vessels at its U.S. shipyard. Hanwha announced a $5 billion program dedicated to the installation of additional docks and quays to increase capacity at the shipyard. It is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility, and through the expansion, Hanwha aims to increase Philly Shipyard’s annual production volume from less than two vessels to up to 20. In addition to the infrastructure investment, the U.S. subsidiary of Hanwha’s shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, announced that it has ordered 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers from Hanwha Philly Shipyard, with the first tanker expected to be delivered by early 2029. It previously announced it will buy a Korean-built LNG carrier and complete its outfitting at the U.S. yard to make it the first modern American-flagged LNG carrier built in 50 years. Elaine Chao doing the honors for the naming (American Maritime Officers) Lee toured Hanwha Philly Shipyard, joined by officials from the Department of Transportation, the Maritime Administration, and others from the U.S. government, while attending the christening ceremony. Speaking through a translator, Lee said, ""The Republic of Korea's shipbuilding industry is setting out to take on a new challenge to contribute to strengthening U.S. maritime security and rejuvenating America's shipbuilding industry."" He highlighted the rapid growth of the country’s industry from “bare ground” to a powerhouse in just 50 years and referred to the “miracle of K-shipbuilding.” ""Through the MASGA (Make American Shipbuilding Great Again) project, we will achieve a 'win-win' outcome that would see the shipbuilding industries of both the United States and South Korea take a leap forward together,"" Lee highlighted. Yesterday, he promised Trump that South Korea would invest at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding, along with other key industries. Hanwha Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim expressed gratitude to the leaders of both countries and emphasized the importance of joint partnership in bolstering the shipbuilding industry. He said, “Today’s christening ceremony is the physical embodiment of our two nations working side by side to reindustrialize industry, expand our capacity to build ships, and invest in the skilled workforce that will drive the industry forward.” The third ship of the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) program, State of Maine, is the first purpose-built training ship for the Maine Maritime Academy. At 525 feet in length, it can accommodate 600 cadets for training and, in times of humanitarian need, can handle up to 1,000 people and provide access to an advanced medical facility. The ship, which is due to arrive in Maine later this year, features eight classrooms, an auditorium, and training labs, including a specially-designed training bridge. It has a helicopter pad and is outfitted both to handle containers and roll-on/roll-off cargo to give the cadets hands-on training. “This vessel marks a new era for American maritime power,” said Acting Maritime Administrator Sang Yi, who represented Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was detained in Washington and did not attend the ceremony. “MARAD’s mission to modernize sealift and empower the Merchant Marine hinges on relentless innovation and partnership. Together, we can build the fleet America needs to secure our future and dominate the seas.” Elaine Chao, who has held various senior roles in the U.S. government, including Secretary of Transportation in the first Trump administration, was godmother for the vessel. In prior administrations, she served on the Federal Maritime Commission and as Secretary of Labor. Philly Shipyard had delivered the first two vessels of the class to New York and Massachusetts. Hanwha Ocean is completing the project to build two additional training ships, which MARAD has assigned to the state maritime academies in Texas and California. The yard has also started work on the first of three LNG-fueled containerships for Matson and is completing a rock installation vessel for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Digitalisation Presents Emerging Psychological Pressures for Seafarers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/digitalisation-presents-emerging-psychological-pressures-for-seafarers,,27/08/2025 03:20:17,,"[By: VIKAND] As the digital transformation accelerates across the maritime industry, global maritime healthcare leader VIKAND warns there is a growing need to recognise and address the psychological toll of new technologies on seafarers’ mental health. While digitalisation has enabled earlier intervention and expanded access to mental health services onboard, such as remote counselling and telehealth, VIKAND notes that the long-term impact on seafarers' well-being is still unfolding. “Early access to care is undoubtedly promising, but we're only beginning to understand the psychological cost of this digital shift,” says Martin Hedman, VIKAND's Director of Mental Wellness Practices. “Technology is a double-edged sword - it streamlines support, yet introduces stressors that we haven’t fully accounted for. “Over the past 20 years, new psychological stressors have emerged from digital life including doomscrolling fatigue, loneliness from social isolation through phone use, and anxiety from navigating the increasingly complex digital processes.” One of the most pressing concerns is the persistent stigma and privacy issues surrounding digital mental health services. Many crew members, particularly senior staff, remain cautious about engaging with these services due to concerns that their data could be misused or held against them, such as losing their jobs. These anxieties, while rarely spoken outright, are frequently raised in informal conversations. Generational differences also play a role. “Older crew members often struggle more with digital interfaces, such as using smartphones for training or health access,” says Martin. “What is intuitive to a younger seafarer may be a barrier to another, amplifying stress and isolation.” Though no direct increase in mental health cases explicitly citing “technology” or “automation” has been recorded, VIKAND observes that digitalisation subtly contributes to workload pressures and fatigue, particularly in non-marine departments tasked with managing complex digital systems. Mental health professionals are integrating tech-related stress and digital fatigue into broader wellness discussions, though VIKAND says formal protocols are still emerging. Looking ahead, Martin notes that ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) could become a growing theme. With constant connectivity, seafarers are increasingly exposed to life onshore potentially heightening feelings of separation from family or online social engagement. “FOMO will be a big part of the ever so connected seafarers’ stress in the future. That is not just stress about always checking your email or social media account, but also to become even more aware of what you are missing out when you are away such as being reminded of family,” explains Martin. Additionally, automation may streamline tasks but also shift certain responsibilities onto crews, sometimes increasing the administrative load. “It’s important that we ensure these tools are implemented with care – designed to support, not overwhelm,” adds Martin. ""We need to balance the benefits of technology with a more mindful approach. He adds that with connectivity, over-accessibility may foster habits of always needing to be online, potentially leading to digital dependency. . “In today’s connected world, mental health and digital environments are closely linked,” concludes Martin. “The maritime industry could benefit from adapting further to that reality.” For more information about VIKAND’s mental wellness initiatives, visit www.vikand.com.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Wallem Launches Vessel IT Security and Management Services,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/wallem-launches-vessel-it-security-and-management-services,,27/08/2025 03:10:58,,"[By: Wallem Group] Wallem Group, a leading global maritime partner, has launched a suite of support and consultancy services to protect IT systems onboard its clients’ vessels from disruption. Its new Vessel IT Security and Management Services (VITS) offer comprehensive support to enable smooth, secure and efficient IT at sea in an increasingly digitalised and regulated maritime world. VITS have been developed with a ship's entire digital ecosystem in mind – from its business networks to the Internet of Things (IoT) systems on which operations and humans rely. It includes six management and security services to help keep vessel IT systems up and running, and minimise cyber threats. Wallem VITS offer continuous Servicedesk Support to customers from experts in vessel IT. When necessary, enquiries are escalated to specialist in-depth service teams. A Remote Vessel Infra Support service swiftly resolves IT issues from shore. In more complex cases, Wallem offers Onboard Vessel IT Support, deploying engineers to the ship to offer hands-on assistance with IT infrastructure, system upgrades, health checks and troubleshooting. “The VITS suite is Wallem’s comprehensive response to shipping’s advancing digitalisation, and the critical role IT reliability plays in maritime operations,” said Steve Whitby, Group IT & Technology Director, Wallem Group. “Ship owners increasingly seek efficiencies from remote IT support, remote management, and remote monitoring of vessel operations. Securing these benefits requires deep IT knowledge and long-standing maritime experience. VITS delivers these core specialised services.” Shipping’s growing reliance on IT explained why the other three service modules in VITS focus on cyber security, added Whitby. “Modern vessel operations demand connected IT infrastructure, but this can expose outdated onboard systems and virus signatures, hardware performance issues, and deficiencies in data back-up and IT support. Owners must secure networks, onboard systems, and data against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorised access.

South Africa Restricts Bunkering to Protect Endangered Penguin,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/south-africa-restricts-bunkering-to-protect-endangered-penguin,,27/08/2025 03:06:16,,"South Africa's government has implemented new restrictions on STS transfers and bunkering off its coastline, hoping to head off environmental damage from a potential spill. Its Algoa Bay area is a key bunkering hub for traffic on the Cape of Good Hope route, which has grown by leaps and bounds due to the Red Sea crisis - but conservation groups say that all the activity is putting a colony of critically-endangered penguins at risk. The regulation bans STS transfers within three nautical miles of shore, as well as areas within aquaculture zones and marine protected areas. The rule sets up restrictions on bunkering in Algoa Bay, limiting transfers to specific anchorages and imposing seasonal restrictions on activity. Operators will also have to monitor for the presence of protected penguins and marine mammals during transfers, and will have to use a hydrophone system to listen for the movements of these species. To further reduce the risk of pollution, transfers will be prohibited in wind speeds over 22 knots or wave heights over six feet, and only a limited number of vessels will be allowed in the bay at any given time. Operators will also be required to maintain spill-response vessels on standby to be ready to clean up in the event of a petroleum release. Breaches of the new rules are punishable with a penalty of up to $2.1 million and a prison sentence of up to five years. “These regulations are a decisive step to safeguard our oceans and secure the future of our African Penguin. They set strict standards for offshore ship-to-ship transfers, ensuring that maritime activity can only proceed in a safe and responsible way,"" said South African environment minister Dr. Dion George. Conservationists claim that heightened bunkering activity has cut the population of the African penguin in Algoa Bay by more than 90 percent, putting the world's most endangered penguin species further at risk. Local wildlife NGO SANCCOB said in a statement that it doubts that the new measures will be effective. A colony on Algoa Bay's St. Croix Island was once the largest remaining African penguin colony, with 8,000 breeding pairs living there in 2015, the year before bunkering started in the bay. There are currently 700 breeding pairs on the island, according to SANCCOB, which blamed noise from increased vessel traffic and a series of spills. The group called for banning bunker transfers at night, when releases are least likely to be detected and hardest to clean up, and reducing the wave height limitation to three feet. According to SANCCOB, the government loosened the final version of the rule by removing a requirement for operators to abide by IMO underwater noise reduction guidelines, a modification that favors vessel operators.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Havila Voyages Plans First Climate-Neutral Norwegian Coastal Round Trip,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/havila-voyages-plans-first-climate-neutral-norwegian-coastal-round-trip,,27/08/2025 02:47:14,,"Havila Voyages, which already operates four Norwegian coastal cruise ships fueled with LNG and equipped with batteries, reports it is preparing to take the next step: a climate-neutral round trip along the Norwegian coast. The trip will cover more than 5,000 nautical miles, and the company believes it can be part of an example of Norway’s leadership in transitioning the shipping industry. “Right now, we are in the planning phase to test a full round voyage on the coastal route this fall, using biogas in combination with our large battery packs,” said Bent Martini, CEO of Havila Voyages. “We are in dialogue with suppliers to secure sufficient volumes to be able to fill the tanks 100 percent with biogas, and we believe we will succeed.” Martini revealed that Havila Voyages is exploring the possibility of the sailing on its coastal route from Bergen to Kirkenes and back to Bergen. He said they hope to accomplish it as early as this fall. “That would mean that one of our ships, already this fall, could prove that it is possible to sail over 5,000 nautical miles, the entire Coastal Route, climate neutrally.” Havila built four 15,800 gross ton cruise ships using energy-efficient hull designs created to handle the varied conditions along the Norwegian coast. The ships, which can carry up to 650 passengers, including 179 between ports and 468 in cabins, are LNG fueled and equipped with a battery pack of 6.1 megawatt-hours (MWh). The company in June 2022 demonstrated the capabilities of the 86-ton battery pack, which it says allows them to operate emission-free for up to four hours. The Havila Castor sailed using just the batteries, cruising the historic Geirangerfjord. “If Norwegian authorities are serious about their environmental ambitions, the ships on the coastal route can be a beacon for the green transition in shipping and create synergies for other parts of the industry,” says Martini. “The problem for the maritime industry, when politicians waver in their decisions as we saw in the world heritage fjords, is that no one dares to invest in the green shift.” Martini points out that stricter environmental requirements are fully achievable with today’s technology, and he hopes politicians will stand by the standards they set. “Our message to politicians and decision-makers is clear: climate neutrality should be an absolute minimum in the next contract. And we will deliver on that from day one.” Havila made history in 2018 when Norway, for the first time, split the contract for the coastal operations. It received a nine-year agreement from 2021 to 2030 alongside long-term provider Hurtigruten. Hurtigruten has also made investments in the future, adding batteries and increasing efficiency for several of its vessels. The company has revealed a design study it is pursuing to create the first of a new generation of zero-emission cruise ships. Starting on January 1, 2026, Norway begins a six-year phase-in of its zero-emission regulations for coastal shipping. It starts with smaller ships under 10,000 gross tons, and has already spurred programs for zero-emission battery and hydrogen ferries. By 2032, all Norwegian shipping will have to operate with zero emissions in the historic fjords and on coastal routes.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Red Cat Plans to Start Marketing Ukraine's Drone Boats to the U.S. Navy,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/red-cat-plans-to-start,,27/08/2025 02:21:00,,"An American military drone developer has set up a new division to sell Ukrainian-tested drone boat technology to the U.S. Navy, closing the loop on the cycle of innovation that has defined the Black Sea theater of the conflict. As soon as the Russian full-scale invasion began in 2022, the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine's seaports, repeatedly striking foreign-flag merchant ships off the coast. With American and European assistance, Ukraine countered with strikes of its own. Its forces sank the Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva with antiship missiles, and followed up with strikes on Russian warships in Crimea using British/French Storm Shadow cruise missiles. But Ukraine's real innovation was an exploding one-way drone boat, remotely controlled and cheap enough to be expendable. It was based on an American prototype that had been designed to counter a Chinese invasion fleet in the Taiwan Strait, according to the New York Times. Using this American-origin design, American Starlink connectivity, and American targeting support, Ukraine's defense intelligence agency (GUR) began regularly damaging or destroying Russian vessels in and around Crimea using swarm tactics. After several design iterations, Ukraine's drone boats have also been up-gunned to carry strike UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian air patrols. Using a mix of short range missiles, these drone boats have become the first unmanned vessels in history to shoot down helicopters and fighter aircraft. Using drones alone, the GUR's Group 13 helped Ukraine attain sea control of the western Black Sea, driving the Black Sea Fleet into the relative safety of the Novorossiysk area - without the benefit of a conventional navy. Its success made the Magura design instantly recognizable in defense circles. The U.S. Navy has been investing in its own drone prototypes, reportedly with mixed results - but to date it has not publicly included the Magura series in its test and evaluation program. The defense robotics company Red Cat, a supplier of drones to Ukraine and to the U.S. Army, has offered a way to change that. It announced in May that it would begin marketing proven drone boats with ""10,000+ hours of operating time in live combat missions"" and ""dozens of successful kinetic engagements against enemy assets,"" a description that only matches Ukraine's Magura series. Red Cat has now announced a new division to carry this product line forward in the U.S. market. The new division - Blue Ops - will offer a seven-meter ""Expeditionary Multi-Role Craft"" matching the appearance and dimensions of the Magura V7, but built in the United States. It is intended for deep strike, interdiction and anti-ship warfare - like the V7 - and has autonomous capability, increased range and payload capacity. A spokesman confirmed that it is ""based on technology already being built in various European countries and is being used in the Ukraine war."" Red Cat plans to start production in the third quarter of 2025, in partnership with an existing manufacturer of USVs. To head up the Blue Ops team, Red Cat has hired Barry Hinckley, a member of the Hinckley boatbuilding family, former tech executive, and former candidate for U.S. Senate. Hinckley has experience as a yacht broker, a startup founder and an offshore racing yachtsman. The division's co-leader will be Alexander ""Sandy"" Spaulding, the former president of Hinckley Yachts. ""The future of maritime defense depends on a fast, modular weapons system built in the U.S. That’s exactly what we’re delivering,"" said Barry Hinckley in a statement. ""We’re not replacing large naval vessels—we’re building smaller, smarter, uncrewed platforms that extend their reach, provide forward protection, and can operate in places traditional ships can’t.""",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Samsung Heavy Industries Partners with Vigor as Korea Rolls Out MASGA,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/samsung-heavy-industries-partners-with-vigor-as-korea-rolls-out-masga,,27/08/2025 02:01:33,,"South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries announced a partnership with Oregon-based Vigor Marine Group as part of the companies committing to U.S. investments during the Korean president’s visit to the United States. SHI looks to use the partnership as a way to break into the lucrative repair business for the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) while also supporting South Korea’s “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) initiative. Hanwha Ocean was the first South Korean shipbuilder to win contracts under the U.S.’s maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program, and recently HD Hyundai Shipbuilding reported it has also won its first MRO contract. It comes as the U.S. looks to expand maintenance capabilities and expedite the projects by keeping the ships forward deployed as opposed to having to wait for limited shipyard space in the United States. SHI reports it will leverage its expertise and efficiency in shipbuilding while adding a new element to the forward-deployed repair program. By partnering with Vigor Marine, they report the partnership will combine VMG’s deep customer relationships, proven ability to deliver complex projects on time and on budget, and innovative, commercial mindset with SHI’s world-class Korean shipyard facilities, skilled workforce, and advanced technology leadership. Vigor Marine Group will serve as the lead U.S.-based prime contractor. “We understand the Navy’s evolving needs and have built a track record of delivering results in support of our national defense,” said Francesco Valente, President & CEO of Vigor Marine Group. “Partnering with Samsung allows us to extend that same capability to forward-deployed operations in the Indo-Pacific and potential shipbuilding opportunities here in the U.S. — helping the Navy increase its operational tempo while maintaining the highest quality standards.” Vigor reports it will continue to develop new ways to perform maintenance and modernization work more efficiently and effectively, while SHI will employ its leadership in automation, digital shipyard technology, and advanced engineering. Together, they promise to introduce new levels of innovation to forward repair operations, streamlining processes, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall fleet readiness. The deal was one of several announced during a trade meeting during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to the United States and meeting with Donald Trump. Korean companies committed to a total of $150 billion in investment in areas ranging from shipbuilding to aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and strategic minerals. Samsung Heavy Industries and Vigor Marine report they will also explore opportunities to support a U.S. shipbuilding renaissance, including a return to Vigor Marine Group’s shipbuilding roots in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor CEO Valente said investment and implementation of SHI’s advanced technology could support new shipbuilding opportunities in the United States. Vigor Marine, after being acquired by Carlyle in 2019, has consolidated its operations under a unified brand name with six locations, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to California and Alaska, as well as Virginia. The company has worked to expand its role as a preferred, full-service prime contractor in the defense and maritime sectors, offering advanced services and complete solutions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, Military Sealift Command, state ferry systems, the cruise industry, the commercial fishing industry, and more. HD Hyundai has also developed partnerships in the United States, including with Edison Chouest Offshore. As part of this week’s trade mission, it also announced an agreement with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank for investments into the U.S. shipbuilding sector. Hanwha Ocean is also planning further investments after buying the Philly Shipyard in 2024 and committing to expanding its operations.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ukraine Protests as Russia Opens Mariupol and Berdyansk to Foreign Ships,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-protests-as-russia-opens-mariupol-and-berdyansk-to-foreign-ships,,27/08/2025 00:49:03,,"Ukrainian officials are protesting the release of a new list of ports open for foreign vessels, on which Russia is including the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. Both ports have been occupied by Russian forces since 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Mariupol was the tenth largest city in Ukraine and the second largest in the eastern region. It was a vital seaport handling metals, coal, and grain, and when the war began, multiple foreign ships were trapped in the port. The facilities are said to include 22 deep-water berths. Mariupol was the scene of heavy fighting in the first part of 2022 and a siege that ended up focusing on the seaport, an asset which Russia considers a vital prize in its occupation. The city and seaport finally fell into Russian hands in May 2022, and after many months, the foreign ships were able to escape. Russia was reported to be using it as a supply port, but commercial port operations, however, have remained mostly suspended, other than the accusations by Ukraine that Russia is stealing minerals and grains and shipping them from the port. Berdiansk was an equally important seaport, and it fell into Russia's hands in the first month of the war. It is located just 50 road miles west of Mariupol and was under Russian control by March 2022. Reports said Russia had reopened the seaport and was using it to transport military supplies. The listing of seaports released by the Russian Federation on August 22 includes both Berdiansk and Mariupol as open ports able to handle foreign ships. “We consider such actions as another attempt by Russia to legalize its occupation and consolidate illegal control over Ukrainian territories,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said in a statement issued yesterday, August 25. It “strongly condemns” the Russian actions and says it considers the order “null and void.” Ukraine is calling for Western sanctions on any company or ship that uses either port to support commercial activities. In the past, it has also taken action against ships using the occupied seaports of Crimea. The courts have permitted it to seize and auction ships that carried commercial cargoes from Crimean seaports, and it has jailed and fined crewmembers on those ships. Ukrainian media is reporting that Russia has been using both seaports to export grains grown in the east in the occupied areas of Ukraine. They contend that almost 212,000 tonnes of grain were shipped from Zaporizhia Oblast in 2023 to places including Turkey, Libya, Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Over 300,000 tonnes of grain, they report, have been moved through Berdiansk, while as much as 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes a month of minerals are being exported through the Port of Mariupol. The move comes as Russia seeks to further consolidate its gains and exert control in advance of any potential peace talks. Reports said President Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump during their meeting in Alaska that Russia would keep the occupied territories, including the Sea of Azov ports and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, as part of a peace deal. Trump has suggested there would be some “swapping” of land in the peace agreement. Top image: Port of Berdyansk (Andrew Butko / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Op-Ed: MARAD Should Follow Navy's Lead to Rebuild U.S. Maritime Strength,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-marad-should-follow-navy-s-lead-to-rebuild-u-s-maritime-strength,,26/08/2025 23:21:04,,"Earlier this week, CNO Admiral Daryl Caudle and Navy Secretary John Phelan delineated their goals for the Navy - readiness, accountability, and results. They also identified clear metrics for success. The Maritime Administration and the Department of Transportation should tap the table and immediately do the same. While serving as the Maritime Administration (MARAD) Chief Counsel during the first Obama administration, I visited the rusty Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet. RRF crews repeatedly asked for additional funding, an ask I conveyed to the political appointees in the Department of Transportation (DOT). Sadly, fully funding the RRF wasn't a priority for the DOT and the Office of Management and Budget leaders of the day. The same could be said about increasing the maritime workforce, or strengthening shipbuilding. MARAD also struggled with accountability and results. This struggle stemmed from long-standing conflicting priorities between MARAD, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State and Energy. MARAD advocated for US financed goods to be shipped on US owned and crewed vessels. We fought to write the Congressionally-mandated cargo preference rule. The other agencies argued for simple money transfers. MARAD lost, and the result was the undercutting of the US maritime industry. I applaud President Trump's Executive Order on April 9, 2025 entitled ""Restoring America's Maritime Dominance."" It is now the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. It's a clear directive matched with much-needed dollars from Congress. It stops the decades long decay. Admiral Caudle told Navy sailors and civilians that he wants to be judged by specific results at the end of his tenure, to include: The Maritime Administration's equivalent is MARAD goals are intertwined with those set by the Navy. Both need a successful industrial base to build military and commercial ships. Success being ships built and repaired on time, on budget. Both need fully trained sailors. Both need fully manned ships. To put it bluntly, guns and butter have to move at the same time for the logistics tail in war to work. I am encouraged by President Trump's executive order because it demonstrates top down coverage for a robust US maritime industry, something MARAD didn't have during my term in office. We fought with DOT to write the cargo preference rule and then got undercut by USAID and State. We fought to use Jones Act vessels during the 2011 Strategic Petroleum Reserve release and then got sidelined by the Department of Energy, which wanted the oil to move on foreign-flag vessels. The Trump administration has given MARAD and DOT a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's my recommendation that they seize it, match it with Secretary Phelan's directive of readiness, accountability, and results, and adopt CNO Caudle's warfighting charge to ensure the dominance of the US maritime industry and workforce.

Drydocks World Wins Contract to Build World's Biggest FLNG Installation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/drydocks-world-wins-contract-to-build-world-s-biggest-flng-installation,,26/08/2025 21:39:46,,"DP World's shipyard division, Drydocks World, has been awarded a contract to build the world's largest FLNG project. It will be the first time that the company has built an FLNG, among the most complex types of offshore installation, though the firm has extensive experience with LNG vessels and FSRUs. The contract was awarded by Amigo LNG, a joint venture between Texas-based energy firm Epcilon LNG and Epcilon's transition energy subsidiary, Singapore-based LNG Alliance Pte Ltd. The Amigo LNG offshore development comprises a pair of 2.1 mtpa FLNGs, plus two FSUs to store and offload the product. Combined, the offshore facility will have a capacity of 4.2 mtpa, a small but incrementally important volume. The installation site is located off the coast of Guaymas, Sonora - in the sheltered Gulf of California - but the gas to be liquefied will come from America. The site location is well situated for exports of gas from the Permian to Asian markets, without the time and cost of the Panama Canal transits needed by LNG plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. ""By partnering with Drydocks World on the world’s largest FLNG facility, we are securing best-in-class quality, exceptional production capacity, and reliable long-term performance of this critical asset. We are also harnessing the key advantages of FLNG solutions — from faster project schedules to rigorous testing and seamless pre-commissioning in a controlled fabrication yard environment,"" said Dr. Muthu Chezhian, CEO of the LNG Alliance.

On Monday, LNG Alliance announced that it has signed a long term sale and purchase agreement with Macquarie covering 0.6 mtpa of the facility's production for the first 15 years of operation. Amigo LNG said that it would have its first liquefaction train for that contract up and running in the second half of 2028, the same timetable as the completion of Drydocks World's FLNG commissioning.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Trump Administration Plans to Withdraw Approval for Maryland Offshore Wind,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-signals-intent-to-withdraw-approval-give-us-wind,,26/08/2025 21:15:16,,"The efforts to derail the U.S. offshore wind energy business are continuing with the Department of Justice confirming the Trump administration’s intent to withdraw previously issued approvals for Maryland’s first offshore wind farm to be developed by US Wind. Justice informed district courts in Delaware and Maryland of its intended action following an earlier jurisdictional dispute between Maryland and the federal Environmental Protection Agency that also sought to challenge the process for the Maryland project. The TV news channel in Maryland, WBOC, reported on Friday, August 22, that the Department of Justice had moved to stay a pending lawsuit in Delaware in which a homeowner is challenging the wind farm’s permits under the Clean Water Act. The reasoning the DOJ gave was its intent to withdraw approval for the wind farm, making the court case irrelevant and a waste of time. DOJ on Monday, August 25, WBOC reports, filed additional details in the District Court of Maryland. There it told the court that the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) intends to “voluntarily remand and vacate its approval of the Construction and Operations Plan” for US Wind’s Maryland windfarm project. DOJ revealed the action would come by September 12. The filing does not reveal the reasoning, but opponents of the project have long argued the approval process was rushed, lacked transparency, and “completely ignored” the concerns of residents and the city government in Ocean City, Maryland. In the past, BOEM and the Department of the Interior have said they found “concerns” when they reviewed the approval process for other wind farm projects. Last week, the Department of Commerce also cited national security concerns, saying it would launch a review of the foreign supply of material and equipment for the wind energy industry. The Biden administration approved the Maryland wind farm project in 2024 after what the company says was a multi-year and rigorous public review process. Residents and businesses in Ocean City have argued that the wind farm would hurt their tourism business. US Wind asserts that the project has a strong legal footing, and it is confident that the project’s permits were validly issued. US Wind, which is a partnership between Italy’s Renexia and American investment firm Apollo Global Management, won its lease for nearly 47,000 acres in August 2014. Final federal approvals were given in 2024, and by Maryland in June 2025. The plan calls for two phases, which, when completed, would have 114 turbines and approximately a total of 2 GW. Reports said construction could start as early as 2026, although the DOJ is citing 2028. The EPA last month sought to challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment, alleging the state was making an error in the administration of the final appeal process for permits issued to the wind farm. The state authority fired back, saying it was the EPA that was wrong, that the authority lay with the state, and that state-issued permits adhere to, or are more stringent than, federal requirements. Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who was already in a war of words with Donald Trump over the assertions about Baltimore’s police and a plan to send in the national guard, angrily responded to the news that the administration plans to challenge the wind farm. In a statement to WBOC, Moore called the administration’s plans “utterly shortsighted,” citing the investments and jobs the wind farm would provide. He said the president’s actions will directly lead to utility rate hikes for Marylanders. Moore followed the governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, who have also been speaking out after the administration last Friday, August 22, issued a stop work order for Revolution Wind, an offshore project that has been under construction since 2024. Denmark’s Ørsted said it would comply while noting the project is 80 percent installed. It is looking for clarity and considering actions, including a lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken multiple steps since its January 2025 inauguration, starting with the presidential executive order putting the sector and the leasing process under review. It has suspended future licenses, approvals, and reviews, and then started challenging approved projects. In New Jersey, it withdrew an EPA permit related to the proposed construction of a wind farm, while in New York, it suspended offshore work for a month for the Empire Wind project. In New York, it relented after political pressure, including from the Norwegian government, and reports of a deal to permit a blocked oil pipeline to proceed. The actions of the administration have created further uncertainty and pressure on an industry that was already facing challenges ranging from rising costs to supply chain problems and a lack of vessels for installation. Investors have backed away from the U.S. industry, saying the latest moves are making the risks too high to proceed with developments.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Wan Hai released the update saying the tow is underway toward the Middle East, but the final port of refuge is still under consideration. The move toward the Middle East came after Sri Lanka rejected an application for the vessel to be berthed, while India had, shortly after the fire began, ordered its ports not to accept the vessel. The crew reported that the ship experienced an explosion and subsequent fire while sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Nhava Sheva, India on June 9. At the time it was approximately 50 nautical miles off the coast of India. “At present, the vessel’s stability, structural integrity, and draft—together with the route assessed using weather-routing software—meet the requirements for safe towing,” reports Wan Hai. The shipping company working with the appointed salvage company said the process will be closely monitored to ensure a safe and smooth arrival at the designated port of refuge. Last week, Hapag-Lloyd, which had cargo aboard the ship, gave an update putting its position approximately 177 nautical miles from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and close to the Indian EEZ boundary. India, in late June, had ordered the salvage tugs to pull the ship out of its EEZ, where the ship had remained for more than eight weeks while salvage efforts proceeded. For the past few weeks, the salvage reports have indicated that there were no visible flames or signs of fire, although one hold continued to show minor signs of smoldering. Temperatures have also been lowered aboard the ship. Salvors were able to board the ship and undertook the efforts to dewater the holds and engine room. While the danger seems minimal at this point, they have struggled to find a port of refuge. Reports said they were looking to the east, working with Singapore Maritime & Ports Authority as the flag state for the ship. The ship instead is going to be towed approximately 1,800 nautical miles crossing the Arabian Sea. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which also suffered a significant container fire off the coast of India, also ended up making the trip to Khor Fakkan in the UAE before a port of refuge could be settled. However, in that case, the ship had not been abandoned and was traveling under its own power. The UAE has large, deep-water ports that can serve as a refuge. It also has the container handling capabilities to clear the debris from the vessel. The last pictures, which came from the Indian Directorate General of Shipping in mid-July, showed that after the fire was extinguished, nearly everything on the forward two-thirds of the ship in front of the deck house and bridge had been damaged. A few containers on the stern appear to have been blocked from the fire by the deckhouse. The vessel also appeared to be on an even keel and higher in the water after the dewatering efforts.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Trump: ""We're Going to be Buying Ships From South Korea""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-we-re-going-to-be-buying-ships-from-south-korea,,26/08/2025 06:50:56,,"Shipbuilding was at the top of the agenda in talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, and the outcomes included a pledge from Trump to buy ships from Korea. In hopes of securing lower U.S. tariff rates and keeping the multibillion-dollar Korean auto industry competitive on the U.S. market, Seoul pledged an investment of $150 billion in America's shipbuilding sector. The bid was successful: Korea won a 10-point reduction in its tariff rate, putting its manufacturers on the same footing as competitors in Japan and the EU. To get the Trump administration to seal the deal, Korean trade officials came up with a slogan - ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. This gesture won the attention of the administration's trade negotiators, yielding a more favorable 15 percent tariff on Korean cars, computer chips and other exports. Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung was the first major bilateral press conference after the deal was concluded, and it appeared to yield a result that fulfills the hopes of Korean yards as well: an American intention to buy Korean hulls. ""We're going to be buying ships from South Korea,"" Trump said. ""We love their ships."" Trump told reporters that in the long term, ""we're also going to have them make ships here with our people, using our people, and we're going to go back into the shipbuilding business again."" As for timing, Trump emphasized that ""it takes a while"" and that ""shipbuilding is a tough one to start."" In addition to favoring Korean ships, Trump has also spoken highly of Finnish shipbuilding. Earlier this year, he told reporters that he has negotiated personally with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on the terms for purchasing used and new icebreakers from a non-U.S. shipyard. Two Finland-based yards, Helsinki Shipyard and Rauma, are said to be bidding for a program to build medium icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard (in cooperation with local partners in the United States). Korean state investment with U.S. guidance Coinciding with the Trump-Lee meeting on Monday, the U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management announced a partnership with Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai to launch a new ""maritime investment strategy"" focused on American shipbuilding opportunities. The new strategy, Cerberus Maritime, will also look for investment possibilities in the American maritime industry writ large, including maritime logistics, supply chains, infrastructure, ports and technology. HD Hyundai will provide shipbuilding expertise and serve as an anchor investor in the partnership. In addition, it will bring with it the Korean government's state sponsor for shipping and shipbuilding, Korea Development Bank (KDB). The policy bank is known as a lender of last resort for Korean shipyards; it was the largest shareholder in DSME before it arranged the yard's sale to Hanwha in 2022. In its investment role with HD Hyundai and Cerberus, KDB will ""facilitate investments into the Cerberus Maritime strategy"" in recognition of the initiative's importance to Korean national objectives. Cerberus and HD Hyundai have worked together in shipbuilding before. In 2022, Cerberus bought the former Hanjin-owned shipyard in Subic Bay, the biggest yard in the Philippines. Cerberus has leased out part of the space to HD Hyundai, which is investing $550 million at the site and plans to begin building product tankers there by early next year.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Whale Atlas: An Easy-to-Use Mapping Tool for Whale-Safer Global Navigation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/whale-atlas-an-easy-to-use-mapping-tool-for-whale-safer-global-navigation,,26/08/2025 04:48:00,,"2025 has been a tumultuous year for large whales in California and beyond. At least eight gray whales have been killed by ship strikes just in the Bay Area. While the majority of ship strikes go unobserved and undetected, researchers estimate that 80 endangered whales are fatally struck each year off the West Coast of the U.S. This reality was the impetus behind creating a new online portal which offers digitized details of whale conservation zones to make it easier for mariners planning multinational transits to understand and cooperate with whale-protection measures. In many places throughout the world, high-traffic shipping zones overlap with whale foraging areas and migration routes. Marine managers aim to reduce the risk of strikes by slowing ships down or asking them to avoid certain areas at certain times of the year. For the past ten years, Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies (BWBS) has engaged shipping companies, asking them to reduce their speeds voluntarily to a whale-safer level of 10 knots or less off the coast of California during peak whale migratory season. Programs like BWBS, which verifies cooperation with NOAA’s voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) requests, work collaboratively with industry, and have been proven to be effective - reducing fatal strike risk by 50%. Where and when vessels reduce speeds is just as important as the slowing down itself. Resource managers use the best available science to determine the placement and timing of VSR zones. Video credit: Katherine Brook; vessel and whale footage by Adam Ernster Advancing global awareness and collaboration around whale protection measures Whale conservation programs and protection measures centered on reducing shipping impacts on whales exist around the world, including in the Strait of Gibraltar; Hellenic Trench; Bering and Salish Seas; Costa Rica; Gulfs of Panama, Hauraki and Saint Lawrence; and the Canadian Arctic. In 2023 and 2024 the World Shipping Council released a first-of-its-kind Whale Chart Report that compiled and outlined whale protection measures across the globe in order to raise awareness to mariners of opportunities to reduce biodiversity impacts. This included VSR zones, Areas to be Avoided (ATBAs), and Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), all aimed at directing vessel traffic to either reduce speeds within or stay away from critical whale habitat areas. Seeing an opportunity to make this valuable information more interactive and user-friendly, California Marine Sanctuary Foundation (CMSF) and the BWBS team developed an online platform to enhance how mariners access and engage with the information critical to understanding and cooperating with whale protection measures. CMSF is proud to introduce “Whale Atlas: A Mariners Guide to Whale-Safer Shipping” This new, online portal showcases digitized whale conservation zones and protection measures relevant to maritime shipping activities. It houses information on: Whale Atlas with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary selected, part of the NOAA voluntary VSR request, and Blue Whales Blue Skies program in California Whale conservation zones represent areas where mariners are requested to either: reduce speeds or avoid important habitats for a few months or year-round. Whale Atlas provides this information, as well as the source/administering agency, so mariners can zoom in and out of relevant geographies, learn about opportunities to operate more sustainably, download layers in relevant formats, and incorporate measures into their transit plans. CMSF and the BWBS team will regularly update the data to ensure that the conservation zones are current as guidance, data, and priority zones evolve. Maritime shipping is a global industry, and Whale Atlas brings us one step closer to ensuring that mariners consider whale-friendly shipping practices on the same global scale. Whale Atlas is now live and can be found on the new Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies website at https://bluewhalesblueskies.org/resources/.

Daryl Caudle has been sworn in as the Navy's newly-confirmed Chief of Naval Operations, taking over from Vice CNO Adm. Jim Kilby, who has been in the top post in an acting capacity since the dismissal of Adm. Lisa Franchetti in February. Caudle is a chemical engineer by training, and he commissioned into the Navy after graduating from North Carolina State; he holds a masters in physics and another in engineering management, plus a doctorate in organizational leadership. He has run Fleet Forces Command, the Navy's training and sustainment arm, since 2021; before that, he was a career submarine officer, culminating in an appointment as Commander, Submarine Forces - the Navy's top undersea domain officer. ""The sailor will be front and center in my vision throughout my tenure as CNO — hands down, no exception,"" Caudle said at his change of command ceremony. ""To ensure that they are ready to fight and win decisively — today, tomorrow and well into the future — we will view everything we do we through an operational lens focused on three priorities: the foundry, the fleet and the way we fight."" The new CNO also emphasized that the Navy must transform itself with AI, robotics, autonomous systems, hypersonics and other advanced technologies in order to maintain deterrence. ""The way we fight today will not be the way we fight tomorrow,"" Caudle said. Caudle has a reputation as a persistent solver of technical and organizational problems. He was selected at a time of pressing need: all of the Navy's new construction programs are behind schedule, and existing surface combatants, subs, amphibs and carriers face delays at repair yards, reducing availability. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan made clear that Caudle's troubleshooting skills were valued. ""Admiral Caudle, 'the honey badger,' is the right man for the job,"" Phelan said. ""He has a reputation for challenging the status quo, demanding results and refusing to accept excuses. I look forward to seeing that relentlessness pursuit of excellence and persistence pervade the halls of the Pentagon."" Caudle takes the helm at a time of rapid change for the Navy, both in personnel and in structure. Last week, Navy Reserve chief Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Navy Special Warfare commander Rear Adm. Milton ""Jamie"" Sands III were both dismissed from their posts. The Navy has not provided a reason for the dismissals; both leaders had been promoted to their positions in August 2024. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to pull responsibility for sub procurement out of the Navy's command structure and put it directly under the deputy secretary of defense, according to USNI. A new three-star ""submarine czar"" in the Pentagon will have budget control over sub maintenance, oversee the multibillion-dollar industry-boosting program for the sub supply chain, and work with the Navy to set requirements for new submarines - all functions that previously existed within Naval Sea Systems Command.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Two Canadian First Nations Buy Strategic Mining Port Terminal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/two-canadian-first-nations-buy-strategic-mining-port-terminal,,26/08/2025 03:00:06,,"In a first-of-its-kind transaction for Canada’s British Columbia Province, two First Nations have formed a partnership with a Canadian logistics company and will acquire the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal located in northwestern British Columbia along the U.S.-Canada border. It comes as there is an increasing push to tap Canada’s minerals and resources for economic advancement. ""This isn't just about us purchasing the first Indigenous majority-owned port in British Columbia's history,"" Andrew Robinson, chief executive officer of the Nisga'a Lisims Government, told The Canadian Press. “It's about economic sovereignty, reconciliation, and ensuring that wealth generated from our lands directly benefits our people and generations to come.” The Nisga’a Nation and the Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership are partnering with Arrow Transportation Systems to launch the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. The new group is also consolidating the regional trucking operations of Arrow Transport’s Stewart Trucking Division and Tahltan-Arrow Transport to provide bulk transportation and logistics solutions in the Tahltan Territory. They note that Northwest BC is home to more than half the province’s exploration and mining sector. They believe the new partnership will provide improved access to deliver critical minerals from mine to market. The Port of Stewart is Canada’s most northerly ice-free port located to the north of Prince Rupert and supplying critical access to both British Columbia and Alberta. It is 80 to 90 miles from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the Portland Canal and provides support for the logging, mining, and exploration operations in the region. “Together, we are making history,” said Kerry Carlick, President, Tahltan Central Government. “The acquisition of this strategic asset will drive economic growth, create opportunities, and strengthen our nations’ self-determination.” The terminal primarily handles ore and logging with a breakbulk wharf and RoRo capabilities for barges. It can accommodate vessels up to approximately 50,000 dwt for the transport of ore and logs. One of the key customers is Newmont, which operates the Brucejacket and Red Chris mines in the indigenous communities’ territories and transports copper concentrate to market from the port. Newmont is strengthening its ties with the First Nations to support long-term growth of the port as a regional hub and provide the port’s new owners commercial certainty needed to move forward with the investments. The Province of British Columbia has also provided a C$5 million (US$3.6 million) grant to the two First Nations to support the purchase of the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal.

Master Boat Builders Expands Shipbuilding Operations,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/master-boat-builders-expands-shipbuilding-operations,,26/08/2025 02:08:19,,"[By Master Boat Builders] Master Boat Builders, Inc. (Master Boat), an internationally recognized vessel and workboat manufacturer, today announced that it has invested $7.8 million to modernize and expand its shipbuilding operations in Mobile County by adding a new fabrication shop and floating drydock. The expansion project creates 85 new jobs, adding to Master Boat’s skilled workforce of more than 300 workers and further contributes to Mobile County’s strength in shipbuilding and maritime services. “This investment is about more than just expanding our ability to build more high-quality vessels. It underscores our commitment to increasing American shipbuilding capacity and we’re doing it right here along America’s Gulf Coast in Mobile County,” said Garrett Rice, President of Master Boat Builders. “By modernizing our facilities and growing our skilled workforce, we’re positioning our team to deliver critical vessels that support U.S. commerce and industry, all while training the next generation of American shipbuilders.” “Mobile’s maritime industry continues to thrive, and Master Boat’s investment underscores our region’s leadership in shipbuilding,” said Bradley Byrne, Mobile Chamber president and CEO. “By creating new jobs, retaining existing ones and investing in workforce development, this project is a powerful example of how our business community is growing alongside our thriving port and maritime economy.” The expansion includes the construction of a new fabrication building, a floating dry dock to support new harbor tug contracts, workforce training initiatives and infrastructure improvements. “Master Boat Builders is a 45-year-old, third generation, locally owned shipbuilder located in the Bayou. They have employed thousands of people over that span from local communities and currently employ over 300 people. If we can’t incentivize and support the growth of a business like Master, we shouldn’t be incentivizing anyone!” said District 3 Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt. “This expansion not only secures and creates jobs for local families, but it also reinforces the fact that Mobile County is a leader in shipbuilding and maritime innovation and will be for years to come.” This project also supports the region’s ongoing workforce development and training initiatives, reflecting the growing demand for skilled talent within the maritime and shipbuilding sectors. “Master Boat’s expansion highlights the continued momentum of Alabama’s maritime industry and reinforces Mobile County’s position as a hub for shipbuilding and repair,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “This investment not only creates quality jobs but also strengthens the region’s capacity to support a vital sector of our state’s economy.” Work on this expansion began October of 2024 and is expected to be fully operational by October of this year.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Mediterranean NGO Reports Libya Shot and Damaged its Rescue Boat,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mediterranean-ngo-reports-libya-shot-and-damaged-its-rescue-boat,,26/08/2025 01:59:48,,"The NGO SOS Mediterranee released details on an encounter in the Mediterranean on Sunday, August 24, in which it says the Libyan Coast Guard opened fire on its ship and continued to attack the ship for up to 20 minutes. The group released pictures showing shattered bridge windows among other damage, which it reports the Libyans inflicted on the small rescue boat Ocean Viking. SOS Mediterranee has been operating the Ocean Viking, a former North Sea supply vessel for the oil and gas industry, since 2019 under charter from the International Red Cross. Built in 1986 and now registered in Norway, the ship was outfitted with three rigid rescue boats and a medical facility. The group reports it made two rescues on August 23, taking aboard 47 people, including nine unaccompanied minors, who it says are mostly from war-torn Somalia. The Italians had ordered the Ocean Viking to head to Marina di Carrara, a 700 nautical mile trip that would have required 3.5 days, but they received permission to remain in the Mediterranean searching for a third boat with migrants. The Ocean Viking, they report, was 40 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast when they were confronted by a patrol boat on Sunday afternoon. According to their account of the situation, the Libyans first demanded that the vessel leave the area and head north immediately. They said the instructions were radioed in English and Arabic. Today at 3pm, the #OceanViking has been deliberately and violently attacked in intl. waters by the Libyan Coast Guard, who fired hundreds of shots at our ship. The 87 survivors and crew on board were not wounded. We are currently working on a detailed reconstruction of events. pic.twitter.com/i8RkuYI1ep Without warning or an ultimatum, SOS Mediterranee reports that two soldiers aboard the Libyan boat began shooting at the Ocean Viking. They are claiming the patrol boat circled the vessel, shooting for up to 20 minutes. Four windows on the bridge were broken, multiple antennas were destroyed, and several bullets struck and damaged the three fast rescue boats, along with other equipment. None of the migrants or crew were injured. The Ocean Viking issued a mayday and called NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian. They report that they were told an Italian navy ship was the closest NATO asset, but it did not return calls. The captain of the Ocean Viking started his vessel for Syracuse, Italy, but the authorities later ordered them to sail to Augusta. SOS Mediterranee is demanding a full investigation into the incident. It is also pointing out that the vessel that attacked them was one of two patrol boats Italy gifted to Libya in June 2023. There have been similar incidents in the past with the Libyan Coast Guard and the rescue vessels. This one, however, was more aggressive and longer. The group says its volunteers and the survivors were clearly threatened and felt in serious danger.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
U.S. Coast Guard Sets Record With 34-Tonne Cocaine Offload,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-sets-record-with-34-tonne-cocaine-offload,,26/08/2025 01:48:45,,"The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Hamilton has offloaded a record-setting 34 tonnes of cocaine at the pier in Port Everglades, a quantity of the drug rarely seen in one place. It is the service's largest single cocaine offload on record, and the Coast Guard estimated its value at a (much-reduced) price of just $470 million. An overabundance of South American cocaine exports have pushed down prices in export markets, increasing volume and reducing its value at the same time. USCGC Hamilton offloaded cocaine collected in 19 separate interdictions near Aruba, Haiti, Venezuela, Curacao, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Bonaire, and a variety of high-seas locations in the Eastern Pacific, from Ecuador to Mexico. Six different Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy vessels participated in the seizures, but Hamilton played the largest role, conducting 11 interdictions and seizing a record 47,000 pounds of cocaine. Cocaine bust off Bonaire, facilitated by destroyer USS Cole (USCG) “Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,” said Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer of Hamilton. “The commitment and sacrifice of our deployed service members and their families, who forego time together for the protection of our Nation, are to be celebrated.” A large share of the cocaine traffic through the Caribbean is destined for Europe, not the United States. European customers account for about one fifth of global cocaine demand, and have historically paid a premium for the drug. The Coast Guard priced out the shipment's U.S. wholesale value at about $14,000 per kilo, a fraction of the 2024 EU average of about $35,000 per kilo; EU street and wholesale prices have fallen since the first quarter of 2025, according to multiple European media reports, driven down by an abundant supply and a price war between cartels.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Zim Confirms Turkey’s Immediate Ban on Shipping Associated with Israel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/zim-confirms-turkey-s-immediate-ban-on-shipping-associated-with-israel,,26/08/2025 00:58:53,,"Zim confirmed the earlier reports that Turkey has begun turning away ships associated with Israel. The company, which is the ninth-largest container carrier, reports it is rerouting ships scheduled to call at Turkish ports and working on a mitigation plan. In a stock exchange filing on Monday, August 25, Zim writes, “It received a notice from the Turkish Port Authorities through the company’s local agent in Turkey, that as a result of a new regulation adopted in Turkey, vessels that are either owned, managed or operated by an entity related to Israel will not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports.” The change was said to be effective immediately as of last Friday. The Globes newspaper in Israel reports that one of the company’s ships was turned away from Istanbul last Friday. It writes that the vessel was forced to proceed to Piraeus, Greece, and that there is no clear solution for the cargo scheduled to be loaded or unloaded in Istanbul. The new regulation also impacts all vessels that are carrying military cargo destined to Israel, which Zim says it was told would not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports. Also, Turkish-flagged vessels are prohibited from calling at Israeli ports. Globes reports that while it is an expansion of the trade embargo Turkey imposed 15 months ago, it says shipping companies are still waiting for clear instructions from the Turkish government. It says other major carriers, such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, are seeking clear instructions. A ship’s flag is said not to be a guarantee that it will be permitted into a Turkish port. It is not the first country to bar Israeli shipping, for example, Malaysia took a similar step in December 2023, but it is a minor trading partner with Israel. Turkey and Israel had a large trade flow, and even after the embargo, trade continued between the countries. The ban comes as Zim has already been under pressure. Last week, the company reported a 15 percent decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2025 and a 38 percent decline in earnings (EBITDA) for the quarter. Carried container volume was down six percent in the second quarter to 895,000 TEU, but box volume for the six months was up year-over-year to 1.84 million TEU. Management cited the company’s agility and ability to respond to the challenging market conditions. Based on its outlook, it raised its midpoint guidance for the full year 2025 despite the softness in the quarter. Today, it however, warned that if Turkey’s ban remains unchanged, it is expected to negatively impact financial and operating results. Recently, there have been market rumors that management was exploring a possible buyout of Zim with an investment group. Zim went public in January 2021 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
NTSB: Barge Grounded in Prince William Sound After ATB's Lines Parted,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-barge-grounded-in-prince-william-sound-because-atb-s-lines-parted,,26/08/2025 00:41:25,,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the results of its investigation into the loss of the barge Cordova Provider, which ran aground in Prince William Sound and suffered so much damage that it was declared a total loss. Cordova Provider began life as an ice-class oil recovery barge, but in 2005 it was modified with a notch to serve as one half of a unique ATB. The other half, the tug Krystal Sea, was built at the Western Towboat yard at the same time. Instead of coupler pins like those found on an Articouple or Intercon system, the Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider fit together with a wedge-and-recess system that had no moving parts. Three wedges on the tug - one on the bow, one to port and one to starboard - would line up with corresponding recesses within the notch at the stern of the barge. Changes in relative draft could be compensated for by backing out of the notch and re-entering at a different set of recesses. Instead of a positive mechanical connection, the Krystal Sea was held in the slot by four breast lines (push lines) running from the barge to winches on the stern of the towboat, much like an inland towboat. When Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider were built, the lines and bridles were steel wire rope; the operator later exchanged the wire rope for Dyneema soft lines, which were lighter and safer for the crew to handle over the side. Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider operated in this configuration to move breakbulk cargo around Prince William Sound, within sheltered waters. On the morning of January 10, 2025, the ATB got under way from Valdez, headed across the sound for Cordova. The forecast called for winds of 45 knots, consistent with wintertime weather along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Six-foot seas were expected in the sound, rising to 10 feet after midnight. The ATB's call in Cordova was completed swiftly, and the ATB departed for Whittier at 2110. By 0200 hours the next morning, as Krystal Sea crossed the middle of the sound, seas rose to 4-6 feet, with wind and waves on the port quarter of the tug - typical conditions, according to the crew. At 0250, the mate on watch heard a line snap, followed by three more. All four of the Dyneema lines that held the tug and barge together had parted in the middle, and the Cordova Provider was adrift. The master came to the bridge and maneuvered to see if there was a way to regain control of the barge, but the surface conditions made this too dangerous to attempt. Instead, the Coast Guard put the master in contact with the operator of the escort tug Latouche, moored nearby. The Latouche arrived on scene at 0550 hours and attempted to retrieve the barge by getting a line onto a bitt on its stern. The crew succeeded, but the line parted shortly after. Latouche was forced to give up the chase as Cordova Provider drifted into dangerous shallows off Axel Lind Island. The barge then ran aground, sustained extensive hull damage on the rocks, and partially sank. It was later refloated, towed offshore and disposed of through sinking in deeper water. Investigators' focus turned to the lines that connected the two vessels as an ATB unit. The operator had switched to soft shackles and Dyneema pennant lines in 2023-4, and the captain had inspected the rigging about five days before the casualty, finding nothing amiss. After the casualty, a technician from the firm that assembled the lines determined that they were in fair to good condition, with minor abrasion. Three had parted in the middle of the pennant section, and one parted at the soft shackle. All components were rated for a 100,000-pound breaking strength. NTSB concluded that the lines likely parted due to shock loading, with cascading failure after the first line parted. As the tug had served in similar conditions before, the reason for the break on this particular trip is unknown.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Northern Lights Injects First CO2 in Subsea Storage Well,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/northern-lights-injects-first-co2-in-subsea-storage-well,,25/08/2025 23:51:55,,"The pioneering Northern Lights project has injected its first shipment of carbon dioxide for long-term storage in a subsea reservoir off the coast of Norway, launching a long-anticipated service backed by Equinor (as operator), TotalEnergies, Shell and the Norwegian government. “With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” said the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, in a statement Monday. Northern Lights is the first commercial-scale project of its kind, and it is the backbone of a constellation of Norwegian carbon-capture initiatives. The offshore reservoir serves as the final destination for carbon from a variety of onshore industries, notably the Heidelberg cement plant in the town of Brevik and the Hafslund waste incineration plant in Oslo. Other future users include Yara, Stockholm Exergi and Orsted, among others, through the provision of long-distance CO2 shipping. An initial small-scale liquefied CO2 shipping service is provided by K Line. Now that Northern Lights is up and running, its backers want to expand it rapidly. The current capacity is just 1.5 million tonnes per year, about the same as the annual emissions of 320,000 non-electric cars. With backing from the EU, its owners plan to add more infrastructure to more than triple that number to 5.0 million tonnes per year. This second development phase should be completed and ready for operation in late 2028. The scope includes an additional jetty, nine new storage tanks, and more injection wells. Over the long term, Equinor wants to have 30-50 million tonnes a year of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035, primarily in Europe and in the U.S.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Italian Coast Guard Responds as Mega MSC Cruise Ship Loses Propulsion Power,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-responds-as-mega-msc-cruise-ship-loses-propulsion-power,,25/08/2025 23:20:27,,"MSC World Europa, one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a reported 8,500 people aboard, lost propulsion early Monday, August 25, off the coast of Italy. The incident drew wide media attention with sensational reports saying it had grounded or crashed. The Guardia Costiera responded to the ship, and it was emphasized that the vessel was never in any physical danger. Introduced in 2022 as the first MSC cruise ship to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, the ship was making a week-long cruise circuit in the Western Mediterranean and sailing between Genoa and Naples when, according to passengers, the vessel stopped at approximately 0530 Monday morning. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard control center at approximately 0730, and two patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched to survey the situation. At 215,863 gross tons, the massive 1,094-foot (333-meter) vessel is reported to have a total of 8,585 people aboard, including 6,496 passengers on an end of summer cruise and 2,089 crewmembers. Some of the passengers were due to disembark today in Naples, and others were waiting to join the ship. The Coast Guard placed officers aboard the ship to survey the situation and reported it was told that the ship was experiencing an electrical problem with its propulsion. The ship is one of the largest to be fueled with LNG. The ship uses GE Power Conversion’s in-board electric propulsion system using two 25 MW induction motors that drive two conventional fixed-pitch propellers via direct shaftlines. It was built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and is third in size only to Royal Caribbean International’s sister ships Icon and Star of the Seas and the Oasis class of cruise ships. MSC introduced a second ship of the class this year and has ordered four more World Class ships. Passengers were reported calm while the ship was drifting approximately eight miles off the coast of the Italian island of Ponza. The ship was able to continue to run its generators and was maintaining passenger services. Two tugs from the ports of Gioia Tauro and Naples were dispatched, and plans were being made to tow the ship, if necessary, the approximately 50 miles to Naples. However, by early afternoon, MSC Cruises was reporting that the crew had been able to initially restore partial propulsion. The Coast Guard did a further inspection, and the ship was moving at 15 knots with a Coast Guard escort to Naples. It docked at 2100 local time on Monday night. MSC said technicians would continue to repair and inspect the cruise ship. Passengers were proceeding with the disembarkation and embarkation. The plan called for the ship to resume its cruise on Tuesday, sailing for Messina.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Finnish Prosecutors Demand Jail Time for Captain, Officers of Shadow Tanker",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/finnish-prosecutors-demand-jail-time-for-captain-officers-of-shadow-tanker,,25/08/2025 22:31:48,,"The trial for the captain and two senior officers of the shadow fleet tanker Eagle S began on Monday, August 25, in the Helsinki District Court. They are facing charges ranging from aggravated sabotage and aggravated telecommunications interference to lesser charges of vandalism and endangering public safety. The trial stems from the December 25, 2024, damage by the 74,000 dwt tanker Eagle S to the undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia, as well as four telecommunications cables. Prosecutors told the court that the laden tanker, which was registered in the Cook Islands, dragged its anchor for a distance of at least 55 miles in the Baltic. For the first time, they also said in court that the vessel appeared to slow as it passed over the cables, and they contended that if the Finnish authorities had not intervened and seized the tanker, it would have done more damage as it continued its trip. The prosecution is reported to be demanding jail time for the master of the vessel, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, a Georgia national, Robert Egizaryan, another Georgian who was the first officer, and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, an Indian who was the second officer on the vessel. The Finnish news outlet Yle reports the prosecution called for sentences of two and a half years in prison, which is near the minimum of two years under the law. The maximum for aggravated sabotage (criminal mischief) is 10 years in prison, while the aggravated charges for interfering with telecommunications are up to five years. They are saying the charges are “aggravated” because their actions were intentional and deliberate. Prosecutors assert the crew was required to operate the vessel safely. The three individuals are pleading not guilty to the charges. The captain speaking to the Swedish Yle last week said it was a “maritime accident.” Defense lawyers reiterated the claim that it was an accident. The captain claimed to Yle that no alarms sounded and that they did not sense changes in the ship. In court, it was revealed that the ship stopped at midday due to an engine problem and was experiencing heavy weather in the Baltic. They have not said when the anchor was deployed, but they are saying a broken safety pin could have caused it to come loose. The court was also told that the braking system for the anchor was heavily rusted and inoperable. The Vessel Traffic Service had made an inquiry to the ship during the afternoon, at which time they said the second officer denied that the anchor was down. It was not until 1845 that they were told they were dragging something on the seafloor and instructed to raise the anchor. The officers claimed that a check of the mooring deck at dinner time that night was not safe because of the weather. The court will also have to take up the question of jurisdiction. The UAE-based shipping company that managed the Eagle S contends Finland lacks authority because the damage happened in international waters and points out that Finland was not endangered because it sends power to Estonia. During the hearing today, the court was told a manager from the shipping company had instructed the captain to delete a report showing the vessel had crossed over the damaged cables. The prosecution is also asking the court to consider compensation for the damage and repairs. The Finnish and Estonian companies have said it cost them more than $70 million to repair the cables, which were out of service for months. Finland conducted a Port State inspection on the Eagle S at the beginning of January and reported 53 deficiencies ranging from fire safety to structural conditions and violations of the Master Labor Contract for seafarers. They reported that radar and firefighting equipment were inoperable and problems in the cargo pump room. The vessel was detained in Finland for 53 days before it was permitted to sail. The incident raised awareness of the dangers to the subsea infrastructure and the issues with the shadow fleet. Baltic and Scandinavian countries increased their monitoring of the shadow fleet and began challenging the vessels on documentation, including insurance coverage. The countries were also successful in getting NATO to deploy additional resources to the Baltic and North Sea. Russia has responded, denying knowledge of the vessels’ actions, and calling the Western efforts piracy, vowing to defend the shadow fleet tankers.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Egypt and Greece Reject Turkish-Libyan EEZ Claim,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/egypt-and-greece-reject-turkish-libyan-eez-claim,,25/08/2025 22:31:21,,"Egypt and Greece have rejected a bilateral accord first tabled in 2019, which seeks to establish a maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya in the Mediterranean. The accord appears likely to be signed up to by the government in eastern Libya, having been agreed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government in western Libya six years ago. The purpose of the accord is to facilitate oil exploration, by establishing a boundary within the sea corridor claimed by Libya and Turkey. When the accord was originally tabled in 2019, it was met with almost universal rejection. It was regarded as a breach of the International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), by the United States, the EU, Russia and the Arab League amongst many, but in particular by Greece, Egypt and Cyprus because the Libyan-Turkish corridor was superimposed over their own UNCLOS-backed claims for 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones. The Turkish-Libyan accord is likely to be hotly contested, and it is not clear what lies behind the revived claim. It is possible that some of those who were originally vehemently opposed to the carve-up have now switched sides, conjecturing that under the Trump administration, potential economic gains could outweigh previous political understandings and the potential breaches of UNCLOS - and also believing that the revival of the Libyan-Turkish claim could become part of a settlement of Libya’s long-running political crisis. Turkey is already in dispute with Greece and Cyprus over exploitation of oil and gas reserves to the south of Cyprus, among many other issues. Greece and Turkey (and Turkey's Ottoman predecessors) have spent centuries contesting territorial control over the region, most recently including the partition of Cyprus in 1974 and the ongoing dispute over islands and maritime zones in the Aegean.

Marie Maersk Resumes Voyage with No Visible Damage From Container Fire,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/marie-maersk-resumes-voyage-with-no-visible-damage-from-container-fire,,25/08/2025 20:39:24,,"The large Maersk containership, Marie Maersk, which has been battling a container fire for nearly two weeks, is reportedly back underway after teams determined it is safe for the vessel to proceed. With the help of external firefighting teams and equipment brought out to the ship while it was off Africa, Maersk has reported that the fire was contained. The company released two pictures taken on Friday, August 22, when a supply vessel reached the scene with additional firefighting equipment. There is no visible fire damage to any of the boxes aboard what appears to be a heavily laden vessel. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU. “After an inspection of affected areas of the vessel and careful consideration of all aspects together with authorities and class, it was deemed safe that Marie Maersk resumes her eastbound voyage around Cape of Good Hope on Sunday. Her next port of destination is under final review, and we will inform as soon as it has been decided,” Maersk reported. Marie Maersk with no visible fire damage to the containers aboard (Maersk) The containership had spent a week lying off the west coast of Liberia after smoke was first detected coming from containers on August 13. The ship was moved closer to the coast so that fire equipment could be brought out. Late last week, the ship rounded the western coast of Africa and was then met with additional supplies offshore near Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire). A supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment reached the Marie Maersk on Friday evening and transferred special equipment onboard on Saturday, August 23. The AIS signal for the ship shows it now underway with a declared destination of Cape Town, South Africa. Its routing called for a stop in Malaysia before proceeding to China. The company has repeated said the navigational equipment and machinery was not damaged, and the ship was stable. Maersk reports that the external firefighting team will remain on board, and “special measures” have been put in place to ensure a safe journey. An intermediate stop might be implemented, Maersk said, depending on the optimal place for handling the damaged containers and to mitigate onward disruptions in its network. Contingencies are in place in case the planned journey needs to be revised en route. The company has not advised on the location of the boxes that were smoking or the nature of the cargo. In general, mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo is one of the most frequent dangers cited for the containership. Maersk has said the full extent of the damage would not be known until the vessel reaches a port and unloads containers from the area where the fire was located.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ukrainian Drones Damage Russia’s Ust-Luga Oil and Gas Terminal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ukrainian-drones-damage-russia-s-ust-luga-oil-and-gas-terminal,,25/08/2025 19:43:58,,"Ust-Luga, one of the main terminals in Russia’s oil and gas industry, was damaged by a long-range attack from Ukraine. It is the second time since the war began that Ukraine has been successful in attacking the facility, and it comes as both sides have increased their attacks against the energy infrastructure. The Governor of the Leningrad Region, Alexander Drozdenko, started posting alerts about UAV attacks on Saturday, August 23, which continued into Sunday. The reports initially placed the drones at various points around the region, with Drozdenko reporting that at least 10 drones were destroyed on Saturday, prompting him to issue a warning for citizens to “refrain from being near industrial zones and enterprises, as well as visiting public places.” On Sunday, August 24, Drozdenko acknowledged that at least 10 drones had attacked the port of Ust-Luga, although he said they were all destroyed. Debris from a drone was, however, reported to have caused a fire at the Novatek terminal. The reports said there were no casualties. The extent of the damage is unclear, and many of the photos being posted online are from a 2024 fire at the plant. Drozdenko said the fire had been “localized” and that the fuel tanks were not damaged. By Sunday afternoon, the report was that the fire at Ust-Luga had been extinguished and Novatek was starting repairs and restoration work. The Ust-Luga terminal in the innermost part of the Gulf of Finland is a key  facility for export of oil and gas. It’s evidently been hit by  long range drones. pic.twitter.com/d6ChcgQQGJ Looks like Ust-Luga was hit by a Ukrainian Shahed-style drone. Some 600 miles from Ukraine. https://t.co/948Ma4zBEz pic.twitter.com/YTlQPjaETo It is believed the gas processing equipment was struck, taking the plant offline. Some reports are suggesting it could take months to repair, which would be a major blow to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Novatek has been operating the facility, which is located about 70 miles west of St. Petersburg, since 2013. Reports are that it handles more than seven million tons of gas condensate as well as more than four million tons of heavy and light oil. It is also a supplier of marine and jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel fuel. The daring attack was staged more than 600 miles from Ukraine and was part of a larger assault on the energy system. Russia’s defense ministry is saying 95 drones were launched across 14 regions and all were downed with minor damage. It acknowledged 13 drones destroyed over Ust-Luga, as well as some damage to a nuclear power plant. Russia has been striking Ukraine’s fuel import and distribution network and facilities. Last week, a tanker was reportedly damaged while unloading at the port of Izmail on the Danube.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Video: Chilean Navy Rescues Survivor From the Rocks in Tierra Del Fuego,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-chilean-navy-rescues-survivor-from-the-rocks-in-tierra-del-fuego,,25/08/2025 05:57:42,,"Against all odds, the Chilean Navy has rescued a survivor from a fishing vessel that went missing off Tierra del Fuego on Thursday. The four fishermen aboard the vessel were harvesting sea urchins, and the crew disappeared along with their vessel, the Ana Belen. Good Samaritan fishermen located the survivor - who was wearing a black wetsuit - in an area known locally as the Bahia Sea, near the western entrance to Beagle Channel. The maze of inlets at the westward fringe of Tierra del Fuego bears the full brunt of the region's stormy weather, and this creates real challenges for shore access. The survivor could not be reached by helicopter because of powerful downdrafts from the cliffs above, and heaving surf made it impossible to get a small boat near to the rocky shoreline. To complete the retrieval of the survivor, a Chilean Navy helicopter dropped a rescue swimmer into the water near the rocks, and he swam through the waves and climbed up on shore to reach the fisherman. Then, together, they got back into the frigid water and swam out to a pickup point. ""The extraction lasted approximately 25 minutes, which was vitally important since they had to swim to the rescue boat that was waiting for them in a safe place,"" said Serio Surriba, commander of the naval aviation unit in Puerto Williams. The survivor has been identified as Juan Andrés Rojas Casco, a Paraguayan national. The search for the three other missing fishermen continues, and the Chilean Navy has pledged to make ""every effort to find the rest of the crew.""

"""Black Box"" on Tanker Eagle S Failed to Record During Cable Break",https://maritime-executive.com/article/black-box-on-tanker-eagle-s-failed-to-record-during-cable-break,,28/08/2025 05:52:48,,"Investigators who boarded the tanker Eagle S after it severed a subsea power cable found that its voyage data recorder (VDR) had failed to record the time period of the casualty - not because of tampering, but because of an inherent design flaw that turned it off. On Christmas Day, a power transmission cable and multiple telecom cables in the Gulf of Finland were suddenly severed. Eagle S happened to be under way in the area, and her trackline corresponded to the damage sites. Within hours, Finnish police boarded the vessel by helicopter and diverted it to Porvoo for arrest and examination. At the time of interdiction, the tanker had its port side anchor chain in the water, and a follow-up survey found a 50-nautical-mile drag line on the bottom - along with the damaged anchor. In early March, Finnish authorities released Eagle S, but detained the master and the first and second officers to await criminal charges. Prosecutors have charged them with aggravated vandalism and aggravated interference with telecommunications, with potential penalties of up to 2.5 years in jail if convicted. The trial is now under way. Any investigation of potential wrongdoing at sea will start with VDR data, including key parameters of vessel status (heading, speed, engine RPM) and audio of crew conversations on the bridge. But investigators found that Eagle S' VDR had ceased recording on the afternoon of December 18, before the incident, and resumed at about 1300 hours on the 25th. Eagle S crossed and severed the subsea power cable about 30 minutes earlier, while the VDR was not recording. The investigators found no evidence of tampering with the VDR, but discovered a curious technical cause. The VDR was an older design from the 2000s, and its time stamp system relied on GPS timing signals, without which it could not function. When the Eagle S sailed into the Russian end of the Gulf of Finland - one of the world's most GPS-denied environments - it lost its GPS signal, and the VDR's time reverted to 2005. The system then auto-deleted these older 2005 files to save space in its limited memory, according to YLE. When Eagle S regained GPS, recording resumed - but only after the ship had already cut the power cable. The officers maintain that they could not reasonably have known that they were dragging an anchor along the bottom, but prosecutors contend that they were negligent in overlooking it. One key piece of evidence presented to the jury this week is an electronic log of the ship's speed, which dropped precipitously in the minutes before the cable break, falling from 12 knots to 9 knots. Engine RPM fell at the same time. The prosecutors contend that the speed change was a clear indication that something was wrong, and that the crew should have checked the anchors. However, the defense countered that the bridge team had noticed the speed drop and contacted the chief engineer, who informed them that the vessel was having engine problems. The chief engineer (who has not been charged) told the court that the engine was indeed having problems on that voyage, and had been an issue well before the casualty. The officers did not think to go forward and check the anchors, the defense contends, because they were relying upon the chief engineer's professional assessment.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 15:22:53

The investigators found no evidence of tampering with the VDR, but discovered a curious technical cause. The VDR was an older design from the 2000s, and its time stamp system relied on GPS timing signals, without which it could not function. When the Eagle S sailed into the Russian end of the Gulf of Finland - one of the world's most GPS-denied environments - it lost its GPS signal, and the VDR's time reverted to 2005. The system then auto-deleted these older 2005 files to save space in its limited memory, according to YLE. When Eagle S regained GPS, recording resumed - but only after the ship had already cut the power cable. The officers maintain that they could not reasonably have known that they were dragging an anchor along the bottom, but prosecutors contend that they were negligent in overlooking it. One key piece of evidence presented to the jury this week is an electronic log of the ship's speed, which dropped precipitously in the minutes before the cable break, falling from 12 knots to 9 knots. Engine RPM fell at the same time. The prosecutors contend that the speed change was a clear indication that something was wrong, and that the crew should have checked the anchors. However, the defense countered that the bridge team had noticed the speed drop and contacted the chief engineer, who informed them that the vessel was having engine problems. The chief engineer (who has not been charged) told the court that the engine was indeed having problems on that voyage, and had been an issue well before the casualty. The officers did not think to go forward and check the anchors, the defense contends, because they were relying upon the chief engineer's professional assessment.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 15:42:19

NTSB: Delayed Emergency Response Contributed to Collision and $1M in Damage,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-delayed-emergency-response-contributed-to-collision-and-1m-in-damage,,28/08/2025 20:30:27,,"The National Transportation Safety Board is out with a new warning for crews about testing and training to respond to a loss of steering control due to a malfunction. It concluded in an investigation into a 2023 collision in the Houston Ship Channel that the failure of a small rubber sheath and a delayed response by the crew to implement emergency steering procedures contributed to the collision after a component failed in the primary steering system. The multi-purpose carrier BBC Africa (7,530 dwt) was departing Houston, Texas, on August 25, 2023, when the vessel suddenly lost steering control and veered off course, striking the docked bulker Common Faith (57,000 dwt), which was at the Anderson Grain Terminal in Houston. The post ballast tank of the bulker was punctured, along with damage to the shell plating, which cost a total of $467,000 to repair. The BBC Africa suffered damage to its bulbous bow, hull, and shell plating and forward bulwarks, costing $700,000 to repair. There were no injuries or pollution reported from the incident. NTSB reconstructed the events using AIS data and crew interviews. The BBC Africa’s Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was not functioning, but the vessel had permission to sail while repairs were being arranged. On the morning of August 25, pre-departure testing of the system on the BBC Africa showed no problems. The second officer tested the steering gear, checked rudder movements, and ran the steering gear pumps, while engineers also completed a pre-departure checklist. The master also tested steering from the port bridge wing and told the pilot aboard that everything was “in good working order.” About 10 minutes after having gotten underway, the ship was making speeds up to 6.8 knots, and everything was going smoothly. The pilot released the escort tug, and the pilot and master ordered that maneuvering control (bow thruster, main propulsion engine control, and steering) be transferred from the port bridge wing to the main control station on the bridge. The chief officer pressed the button to activate the controls on the bridge. The pilot then gave a command for starboard 10, and the helmsman confirmed adjusting the rudder. Sensing the vessel was not turning at the expected rate, the pilot ordered starboard 20 and then hard to starboard. It was then that the chief officer realized the indicator light on the main control station had gone off and tried pressing it several times to reengage the controls. The rudder indicator was showing a hard port position of 30 degrees. The master then switched the vessel’s steering to emergency override mode and got the rudder back to 30 degrees starboard. The pilot also ordered full astern, and the master then put the bow thruster to 100 percent starboard thrust. However, it was too late, and they hit the docked bulker. Investigators were unable to replicate the failure, but working with the system manufacturer determined that a component failure had caused the system to fail. The company’s investigation found the rubber on the joystick (tiller) had invisible cracks that let moisture into the control unit, which contributed to the loss of the electrical signal. The shipping company, on advice from the manufacturer, changed the bridge wing steering control tillers, the “in command” push buttons, and the main power supply transformer. They made the same changes on two other vessels with similar control systems. The report says that the primary cause was the equipment failure. However, they also noted a stressful situation with short reaction time due to the vessel being in the confines of the port. The NTSB notes the crew had gone through training and regular drills, but recommended further training, saying that the delayed response from the ship’s crew to implement the emergency steering procedure from the bridge contributed to the vessel striking the docked bulker. The steering gear manufacturer also issued a safety bulletin. It highlighted incidents with systems manufactured between 2002 and 2009, noting that they had malfunctioned due to a weakness with the protective rubber and the micro switches. The bulletin said the consequence of the failing micro switches could lead to unintended rudder movement.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 21:29:38
Video: Ukraine Damages Russian Missile Boat in the Sea of Azov,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-ukraine-damages-russian-missile-boat-in-the-sea-of-azov,,28/08/2025 18:22:36,,"Ukraine military intelligence has released a video showing one of its one-way attack aerial drones attacking a Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette in the Sea of Azov. The corvette was hit and damaged on August 28, but it is not yet clear if the vessel has been able to recover to port. Defence Intelligence of Ukraine strikes russian ""buyan-m"" corvette — a carrier of ""kalibr"" cruise missiles — in the Azov Sea : https://t.co/Q1lOahxlqy pic.twitter.com/SMPEc1b3Z6 The attack is noteworthy because of the location of the attack. The Sea of Azov is effectively a Russian lake, Ukraine having lost its control of coastline in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in 2022. Hence Ukraine will have had to fly the attack drone either through Russian land-based air defenses in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, or taken a longer route over the sea and around Crimea. The drone’s pilots will then need to have locked onto the target at this long range. Location of the corvette when struck in the Sea of Azov (45°42′N 35°18′E ) (Google Earth, Landsat Copernicus, CJRC) Ukraine has demonstrated it can do this against static targets at extreme range. However, to be able to do so against a moving target at long range is technically a considerable accomplishment. This should once again cause Russian naval commanders to consider the security of their naval assets even in ports far distant from Crimea such as Novorossiysk, to where vessels have already been pulled back for safety. The attack may have been mounted by Ukraine to demonstrate that it can control sea approaches to the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, which Russia has recently sought to open to foreign shipping. Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation) Buyan-M Class corvettes are primarily designed for littoral coastal defense, and are the mainstay of both what remains of the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. They are however armed with two vertical launch cells, each able to hold four Kalibr missiles. The Kalibr is designed to be an anti-ship weapon, but has frequently been used to hit ground targets in Ukraine. In its land-attack version, the Kalibr has a range of 1,500 miles, and can therefore hit targets anywhere in Ukraine form the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 21:29:38

The program administered by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is critical as it transports fuel supplies for the U.S. Department of Defense. Crowley Stena Marine Solutions, the joint venture between Crowley and Stena Bulk, reports that MARAD recently approved operating the MR tanker CS Anthem under the Tanker Security Program. The companies note that the vessel will advance the nation’s strategic sealift capabilities. ""The addition of the CS Anthem demonstrates our commitment to strengthening U.S. maritime security and providing reliable, U.S.-crewed tanker capacity in support of national defense,"" said Tucker Gilliam, vice president of fleet operations for Crowley Shipping. ""Together with Stena Bulk, we are proud to continue advancing solutions that serve both commercial and government energy transportation needs."" The new vessel is largely a swap with the same characteristics as the damaged ship. Built in 2017, CS Anthem had been operating for India’s Scorpio. It is 49,990 dwt compared with 49,729 dwt for the Stena Immaculate, which was also built in 2017, and which it replaces. The databases show CS Antheim was recently transferred to the U.S. flag from the Marshall Islands and now has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida. Crowley is responsible for crewing and managing the tanker under a bareboat charter through the joint venture. The company also manages the tankers Stena Imperative and Stena Impeccable in the Tanker Security Program. Stena Immaculate was anchored off the east coast of England after transporting a cargo of jet fuel. It was waiting for its berth when the containership Solong hit the tanker at anchor. The resulting fire engulfed both vessels, but Crowley’s crew acted heroically, starting fire suppression systems before they were safely evacuated. The tanker survived with portions of its cargo intact. They arranged for another tanker to receive the fuel, and the damaged vessel was towed to Great Yarmouth in the UK, where it appears to still be berthed. The Solong recently arrived at a recycling yard in Belgium, while the master of the vessel is facing trial for the incident that killed one of the crewmembers aboard the containership.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Vanguard Tech Launches Digital CSO Product to Address Insecurity at Sea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vanguard-tech-launches-digital-cso-product-to-address-insecurity-at-sea,,29/08/2025 02:17:28,,"[By Vanguard Tech] As Red Sea insecurity reshapes global shipping routes, Vanguard Tech has launched a first-of-its-kind 'Digital CSO' to assist CSOs in managing risk, resilience, and response at sea. Triggered by ongoing insecurity in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and a growing need to provide seafarers with more than just traditional routing guidance, Vanguard Tech has unveiled its new 'Digital CSO' product, a first-of-its-kind digital Company Security Officer (CSO) solution designed to assist CSOs and give shipping companies live visibility, faster decision-making, and stronger protection in the world's most volatile waters. The product, developed over the last 18 months, encompasses complete end-to-end maritime risk management; from the initial planning stages, all the way through to safe arrival. With the Vanguard Tech Digital Platform anchoring the service, Digital CSO is designed to Assess, Alert, Advise, Act, and Assure. Digital CSO redefines vessel risk through a fully integrated AI-driven platform. The product is available to clients on a tiered basis – ensuring scalable support for fleets of all sizes – and encompasses elements ranging from maritime intelligence, digital tracking, SSAS alerting, closed-loop tracking, annual ISPS-compliant emergency drills, and access to the new Vanguard AI insurance platform. Although the product is applicable globally, some elements have been individually tailored to particular high-risk areas. For example, amidst ongoing Houthi targeting of vessels, the affiliation assessments can give assurances to all stakeholders – from owners to insurers – that vessels can transit high-risk areas safely. Benjamin Simonson, Vanguards Head of Operations said, ""For years, the CSO's duties were carried out in a traditional way. With Vanguard's Digital CSO, we're not replacing that role but empowering it with advanced technology. It's now about live insights, data-driven accountability, and continuous monitoring. By bringing risk intelligence, tracking, and communication together in one platform, shipping companies can make faster, more accurate decisions. The result is fewer delays, stronger compliance, and greater protection where it matters most. For the first time, Vanguard is delivering end-to-end digital risk management for shipping - fully automated, seamless, and designed to give operators, managers, and owners true peace of mind."" The launch comes at a time of heightened global maritime disruption, with shipping seeking smarter, technology-driven solutions to navigate risks such as piracy, conflict spillover, and sanctions exposure. With security conditions in key maritime chokepoints deteriorating, Vanguard positions Digital CSO as a transformational solution for shipping companies — providing not just compliance, but proactive resilience, operational assurance, and safer seas.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
North Carolina Utility Cites Costs Deferring Offshore Wind Power for Solar,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/north-carolina-utility-cites-costs-deferring-offshore-wind-power-for-solar,,29/08/2025 01:55:25,,"Duke Energy, which is one of the United States’ largest energy companies, has determined that offshore wind energy does not offer a cost advantage over solar power for North Carolina. The determination came as the utility was planning its long-term power sources and is based on proposals from the current leaseholders for offshore wind in North Carolina. Headquartered in North Carolina, the company operates utilities in the Southeast as well as the Midwest. Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy. As part of this review, it was instructed to request estimates from the three leaseholders for the development of up to 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. Duke, through its non-regulated subsidiary Cinergy, holds one of the leases that it was awarded in 2022. The project known as Carolina Long Bay is 22 miles south of Bald Head Island and could support up to approximately 1.6 GW. Neighboring Carolina Long Bay is TotalEnergies, which has the potential for 1.6 GW, and the two companies have explored collaborations. A third offshore site available to Duke is Avangrid’s Kitty Hawk South, which was awarded in 2017. The company originally said it could produce up to 2.4 GW, but in 2022 sold the northern portion of its lease to Dominion Energy. The three developers submitted a total of eight proposals, Duke reports in a filing to the Utilities Commission. It was looking for the projects to be developed by 2035. In the filing submitted on August 11, Duke informed the commission that, based on its review, it determined solar and battery storage was cheaper in every instance. The company reports it was comparing the cost of building 3,576 MW of solar panels and 3,440 MW of battery storage capacity. A spokesperson for the company told North Carolina Public Radio that they determined “offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time.” The commission had instructed Duke that if the proposals were cost-competitive, to proceed with a binding request for proposals. Supporters of wind energy were quick to criticize the review, noting that solar only provides power 30 to 40 percent of the time, whereas wind energy can generate between 80 and 90 percent of the time. They said they were “disappointed” that Duke was not proceeding, highlighting that it would require at least a decade before construction and commercial operations could be realized. “The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the public radio station WUNC. Duke Energy is aggressively pursuing solar energy in Florida. The company reported last month that it currently owns, operates, and maintains a portfolio of more than 25 solar sites across Florida that generate approximately 1.5 GW, and between 2025 and 2027, the company plans to build 12 new solar sites, adding 900 megawatts. By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects it will have over 6.1 GW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online. The company is reviewing its North Carolina plans. In a 2024 plan, it showed up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035. Another model included as much as 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. The planning study was undertaken before the Trump administration’s latest moves against the offshore wind energy sector. In addition to its ending leasing, the administration is now starting a national security review. It has also curtailed tax credits and other incentives for offshore wind energy development.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Report: Chemical Tanker Attacked by Pirates in Gulf of Guinea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-chemical-tanker-attacked-by-pirates-in-gulf-of-guinea,,29/08/2025 01:12:36,,"[Breaking] A pirate attack has been reported aboard a chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in the Gulf of Guinea, a rare occurrence in what was once a hotspot of maritime hijackings and kidnappings.

Australia Awards More Preliminary Feasibility Licenses for Offshore Wind,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australia-awards-more-preliminary-feasibility-licenses-for-offshore-wind,,29/08/2025 00:58:16,,"The Australian government reports it is continuing to push forward with efforts to spur development for offshore wind energy. In its latest step, it awarded two additional preliminary feasibility licenses, both going to groups backed by European majors, for what could become the first offshore wind farms in the Indian Ocean. The move comes as some of the major European corporations have stalled their efforts in Australia or withdrawn. Last week, it was revealed that Equinor will not be accepting its feasibility license for a proposed project that would have involved floating wind turbines off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The company reportedly could not reach an agreement with its local partner Oceanex, while last month it also withdrew from a project planned for the Bass Strait. Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, called the new licenses being awarded another important step for the industry in Western Australia. He highlighted that “Western Australia needs some 50 GW of additional generation by 2042.” The zone located south of Perth was declared in September 2024, with the government saying it could provide as much as 11.4 GW of renewable energy. The first of the licenses was awarded to Oceanex Energy, which is planning a project in the northern part of the zone, but awards for the southern portion of the zone were delayed while two developers could resolve an overlap between their plans. One of the new licenses went to a group backed by France’s EFP Group. It is planning the Bunbury Offshore Wind South project. Ocean Winds, a partnership between Spain’s EDP Renewables and France’s ENGIE is also receiving a preliminary license for its Westward Wind project. The preliminary licenses permit the companies to continue planning efforts. They are also required to meet with the indigenous people, which Australia calls “traditional owners.” The companies will later apply for the full feasibility permits. A third project, called Wind With Purpose, is still pursuing discussions with a potential Tier 1 partner, it told ABC News Australia. The government deferred granting it a preliminary feasibility license. Minister Bowen said in a statement, “Australia’s offshore wind industry is progressing, with feasibility licenses granted for projects targeting a total of 24.21 GW of renewable energy and preliminary offers for another 4 GW.” He told ABC News that there is more to come, referencing the ongoing efforts to push forward the offshore wind industry.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
"India Pitches $1 Trillion Maritime ""Roadmap"" to Foreign Envoys",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/india-pitches-1-trillion-maritime-roadmap-to-foreign-envoys,,29/08/2025 00:40:52,,"India's shipping ministry is shooting for the moon with its ambitions for the nation's maritime future. At a meeting for foreign ambassadors ahead of India Maritime Week, Union minister for shipping Sarbananda Sonowal pitched a $1 trillion ""roadmap"" for public and private investment in the nation's critical infrastructure. Speaking to representatives from 28 nations, Sonowal said that India is working to transform and modernize its ports, logistics and shipping systems. ""These opportunities open up a $1 trillion maritime investment roadmap, with strong potential for joint ventures in developing ports and cargo terminal operations, multi-modal terminals, maritime services, shipbuilding, ship recycling and ship repairs, green hydrogen hubs, and sustainable shipping solutions,"" he said. To get ready, India's government has been overhauling the nation's maritime legal structure to bring it up to date and align it with international standards, making the country more accessible for foreign shipping investors. Five newly-passed legislative acts - the Bills of Lading Act, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Merchant Shipping Act, Coastal Shipping Act, and Indian Ports Act - are all part of a plan to update laws that date back to the era of British governance. The investment pitch delved into specifics of opportunities for foreign partners. Port investors could spend on projects like Vadhavan Port, a gigantic transshipment-focused container port in Maharashtra with a proposed nameplate capacity of 23 million TEU at full buildout - enough to double India's entire container-handling capacity. Other opportunities include Galathea Bay Transshipment Port, a large-scale container facility planned in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and Tuna Tekra Terminal, a two million TEU container port on India's west coast, operated by DP World. The government is also looking to attract investors for LNG bunkering hubs, industrial parks and green fuel infrastructure. ""India stands ready to collaborate and lead towards a maritime future that is prosperous, sustainable and inclusive,"" Sonowal said.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Tsuneishi’s China Shipyard Launches Next-Gen Methanol Containership,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/tsuneishi-s-china-shipyard-launches-next-gen-methanol-containership,,28/08/2025 23:59:23,,"The Chinese shipyard in the Tsuneishi Shipbuilding group marked a milestone on August 27 as it floated the first of its next-generation energy-efficient methanol dual-fuel containership. The vessel is also the largest container vessel built by the Tsuneishi Group and part of its efforts to build leadership in methanol-fueled vessels. The newly launched containership will have a capacity of 5,915 TEU. The yard also notes that in response to the growing demand for refrigerated transport in recent years, the vessel can also carry up to 1,400 reefer containers. The name of the vessel and its details were not released by the yard, but the blue livery and funnel markings are distinctive. Maersk is currently completing the introduction of its large, 16,000-plus TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships and in 2023 reported it had also entered a contract with Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group for six 9,000 TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships due doe delivery in late 2026 and to be completed by March 2027. Maersk’s fleet strategy announced in August 2024 called for orders reaching a total of 50 to 60 vessels, equaling 800,000 TEU for delivery between 2026 and 2030. Tsuneishi highlights its new class of vessels incorporates an improved hull form and the group’s proprietary energy-saving technology, MT-FAST, an energy-saving device that improves propulsion efficiency by approximately four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. They also highlight the vessel employing a concept known as a “final solution” towards achieving zero CO2 emissions. It will be capable of using green methanol as its primary fuel. The main engine and also the on-board generators – including the HiMSEN engine (8H32DF-LM) manufactured by HD Hyundai – are capable of operating on methanol fuel. It also adopts a large-capacity shaft generator that enables what Tsuneiship says will be “outstanding fuel efficiency.” It is also designed for shore power. Assembly of the first of the new ships began in April 2025. The vessel launched this week is scheduled for delivery in February 2026. Tsuneishi Shipbuilding says it will continue to advance the practical application of methanol dual-fuelled vessels. In July, the group’s yard in the Philippines launched the world’s first methanol dual-fueled Kamsarmax, and before that, in May, it introduced a methanol dual-fueled Ultramax built at its yard in Japan.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Op-Ed: Shipping Must Evolve to Support Neurodivergent Seafarers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-shipping-must-evolve-to-support-neurodivergent-seafarers,,28/08/2025 23:50:06,,"Whilst the maritime industry continues to adapt to change, one aspect of workforce inclusion is still widely overlooked - neurodiversity. With latest statistics suggesting nearly 20 percent of the global population is neurodivergent, this is not a segment of our society we can simply ignore. The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to the natural differences in how people experience, process, and respond to the world around them. It includes a range of cognitive profiles such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. Autism, for example, is a developmental condition that affects how individuals communicate, interact, and process sensory information. Common traits may include differences in social communication, a preference for routine, sensory sensitivities, and intense focus on specific interests. While these can present challenges in some environments, they also contribute valuable strengths such as attention to detail, reliability, and creative problem-solving. To date, the prevalence among seafarers is unknown. Seafaring is already a demanding profession, with long contracts, unpredictable conditions, isolation from family, and confined living spaces testing the resilience of even the most seasoned professionals. For neurodivergent seafarers, these pressures can be more difficult to manage and often involve additional, less visible challenges. Simultaneously, the idiosyncratic nature of seafaring - with its need for attention to detail, particular social structure, routine onboard, and need for intense focus and problem-solving skills - may appeal to neurodivergent individuals. Despite growing awareness of neurodiversity in other industries, maritime is still in the early stages of recognizing exactly how neurodivergence can affect life at sea. Many operational structures, such as overstimulating environments and training practices, are designed around neurotypical norms. In some cases, cultural attitudes and stigma towards neurodivergence can make matters worse. Misunderstandings or a lack of awareness may lead to unfair assumptions or behavior and, in some cases, even discourage individuals from being open about their needs. This is not just an issue of wellbeing. It also influences safety, retention and long-term career development. Neurodivergent individuals often bring highly valuable skills to maritime roles, such as thinking, problem-solving, pattern recognition, and deep focus. These strengths align with the increasing complexity of maritime operations, particularly in safety and technical environments. However, when understanding and support are lacking, this potential is often overlooked. In April an industry-first initiative by NeurodiversAtSea, the Seafarers Hospital Society and The Seafarers’ Charity was launched. The program is designed to provide tailored support to neurodivergent seafarers and to better understand how maritime environments can evolve to be more inclusive. This is a meaningful step forward, and a strong signal that change is both possible and necessary. That said, progress cannot rest on a few initiatives alone. Industry-wide commitment is essential. There is still a significant gap in data. Without targeted research into the lived experiences of neurodivergent seafarers, it is difficult to develop meaningful support. Strategies must be grounded in evidence rather than assumptions. It is equally important to build disclosure-safe environments. Many seafarers may avoid disclosing neurodivergence due to fear of judgment, limited understanding or the risk of being at a professional disadvantage. Creating a culture of safety and acceptance is essential. People must feel as though they are able to express their needs without any concern for negative consequences or reactions. Training must also improve. Neurodiversity awareness should be included in programs at every level, from cadets to senior leadership. This involves understanding communication differences and adapting daily practices to support all aspects of neurodiversity. Too often, we hear from people who speak confidently about issues they have never personally faced. While intentions may be sincere, policies or initiatives shaped without direct input from those affected often overlook the reality of daily experience. As younger generations enter the workforce, this conversation becomes even more urgent. Many young professionals are more likely to identify as neurodivergent or expect employers to support cognitive diversity. Inclusion is no longer optional. It is a key factor in attracting and retaining future talent. At OneCare Group, we support maritime organizations in making this a reality. Through our Neurodiversity and ADHD Awareness Initiative, we provide the resources and guidance necessary to help ensure that neurodivergent seafarers are not simply accommodated but supported to thrive in every role, both at sea and ashore. By shifting from policy to practice, and from awareness to advocacy, we can drive a more inclusive maritime culture, one where diversity fuels safety, innovation, and human performance.

Report: Lürssen’s Naval Shipbuilder Target for German Defense Consolidation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-luerssen-s-naval-shipbuilder-target-for-german-defense-consolidation,,28/08/2025 22:53:21,,"Media reports in Germany are highlighting the potential for the sale of the shipbuilder NVL (Naval Vessels Lürssen) to defense industry major Rheinmetall as part of the further consolidation in the defense sector. The German government is reported to be encouraging the industry to explore steps to enhance its capabilities to meet the country’s urgent needs. Rheinmetall, a manufacturer of tanks and ammunition, has in the past expressed interest in entering the naval shipbuilding sector. The company is now reported to be in discussions with NVL to acquire the operation, which is one of Germany’s leading naval shipbuilders. The supervisory board of Rheinmetall is reported to be set to discuss the acquisition, writes the German newspaper Bild. The news outlet NDR followed up on the reports by speaking with the company’s CEO during an event on Wednesday, August 27. NDR reports he responded by saying, “We are always interested in expanding our product portfolio...We will only talk about it once decisions have been made.” The German government has been encouraging the industry to explore opportunities while saying it needs to increase the country’s defense capabilities and to do so quickly. NVL is a current partner in the new frigate program with Damen that has become mired in problems with its electronics. Germany’s defense ministry has said it will look to rapidly grow its naval operations based on the increased dangers in the Baltic and North Sea. The German Press Agency (dpa) reports Lürssen sent a letter to its workforce saying, in response to the needs of the government, it has “decided to intensify consolidation talks.” Bild reports that the family that controls Lürssen is looking to focus on the company’s yacht shipbuilding operation. The group separated in 2021, putting Lürssen’s yacht and naval businesses into independent units. Lürssen also recently completed the sale in June of its naval shipbuilding operation in Australia to the local company Civmec. NVL is the product of consolidation in the naval shipbuilding sector. Lürssen and German Naval Yards Keil agreed in 2020 to consolidate their operations. NVL’s operations now consist of four leading yards, including Peene-Werft in Wolgast and Blohm+Voss in Hamburg. Norderwerft in Hamburg and Neue Jadewerft in Wilhelmshaven are dedicated to repairs, refits, and modernisations of naval vessels and auxiliary ships. The products include a specialization in corvettes and patrol boats as well as frigates, minesweepers, and coast guard vessels, both domestically and internationally. TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems) and German Naval Yards are the other two large competitors in the sector. Media reports suggest that Rheinmetall was one of the potential suitors that also looked at TKMS as Thyssenkrupp was considering alternatives for the company before settling on the plan to spin off the naval shipbuilder later this year to shareholders.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
"Study: Maritime Industry is Trying Out AI, But is Still Skeptical",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/study-maritime-industry-is-trying-out-ai-but-is-still-skeptical,,28/08/2025 21:58:59,,"Maritime companies are enthusiastic about AI's potential for streamlining business and operational tasks, but are struggling to move beyond small-scale experiments, according to a new industry study by Marcura and Thetius. The study found that 82 percent of maritime professionals are optimistic about AI's role in their sector, but nearly two-thirds worry that over-reliance on the technology could erode critical human skills and judgment. The overwhelming majority believe that AI tools still need human oversight to make sure that they perform as needed - and it's clear that AI will need human input for data collection, data labeling and prompts, in addition to human evaluation of the outputs. The study, which surveyed more than 130 maritime professionals and conducted in-depth interviews, paints a picture of an industry caught between promise and reality. Though 81 percent of companies are running AI pilot projects, only 11 percent have established formal policies to guide how these technologies should be scaled across their operations. The research identified clear consensus on AI's most promising applications. Nearly all respondents — 97 percent — see benefits in reducing manual workflow inefficiencies, while 87 percent believe AI can improve charter party contract analysis and help spot potential pitfalls. However, more than two-thirds of respondents — 69 percent — expressed concerns that AI solutions might miss critical warning signs in contracts or voyage planning, potentially leading to costly business mistakes. 37 percent said they had personally witnessed AI failures in their organizations, and nearly a quarter of respondents said that AI vendors' claims often fail to match real-world results, The specialized nature of maritime operations are a key factor in these implementation challenges. As anyone in maritime who has tried to use ChatGPT knows, generic AI tools often struggle with the sector's idiosyncratic terms and acronyms, its unique rules and its operational realities - all of which are a foreign language and culture that outsiders have to learn, including software outsiders. ""A general AI agent might interpret 'SF' as 'standard form,' but in shipping, it means 'stowage factor,'"" explained Janani Yagnamurthy, vice president of analytics at Marcura. ""Off-the-shelf solutions might automate basic processes, but they miss the nuanced context that maritime professionals rely on."" The skepticism about AI was highest for legal and compliance tasks; though the legal profession as a whole has adopted widespread use of AI for basic tasks, shipping respondents rated their compliance departments as least-suited for AI usage at present, citing concerns about data governance, regulatory liability and misinterpretation of legal nuances by AI. Maritime-specific, purpose built AI agents may perform better than generic tools for these tasks. Marcura says that its AI-powered contract analysis tools recently helped a dry bulk operator avoid more than $120,000 in potential losses by identifying missing clauses in the draft of an agreement. Despite successes in specific applications, most companies are still just testing the waters, and only 17 percent have established transparent processes for how AI systems inform decisionmaking in their companies. ""When change happens, it's very natural to fear losing control,"" Yagnamurthy said. ""Skilled maritime professionals have spent decades honing their judgment in high-stakes roles. The best AI functions like a co-pilot, not a replacement."" Familiarity and fluency with AI will also need improvement: 38 percent reported that inadequate training is the biggest barrier to scaling up the use of the technology in their business. Poor implementation and poor education of the users can lead to poor outcomes, multiple respondents said. ""People train their AI models but they don’t train their people. If the crew and the office do not understand the AI outputs, it could lead to misuse, which creates mistrust. We need to first train our people and our minds,"" one shipmanager told the research team.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
NTSB: Delayed Emergency Response Contributed to Collision and $1M in Damage,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-delayed-emergency-response-contributed-to-collision-and-1m-in-damage,,28/08/2025 20:30:27,,"The National Transportation Safety Board is out with a new warning for crews about testing and training to respond to a loss of steering control due to a malfunction. It concluded in an investigation into a 2023 collision in the Houston Ship Channel that the failure of a small rubber sheath and a delayed response by the crew to implement emergency steering procedures contributed to the collision after a component failed in the primary steering system. The multi-purpose carrier BBC Africa (7,530 dwt) was departing Houston, Texas, on August 25, 2023, when the vessel suddenly lost steering control and veered off course, striking the docked bulker Common Faith (57,000 dwt), which was at the Anderson Grain Terminal in Houston. The post ballast tank of the bulker was punctured, along with damage to the shell plating, which cost a total of $467,000 to repair. The BBC Africa suffered damage to its bulbous bow, hull, and shell plating and forward bulwarks, costing $700,000 to repair. There were no injuries or pollution reported from the incident. NTSB reconstructed the events using AIS data and crew interviews. The BBC Africa’s Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was not functioning, but the vessel had permission to sail while repairs were being arranged. On the morning of August 25, pre-departure testing of the system on the BBC Africa showed no problems. The second officer tested the steering gear, checked rudder movements, and ran the steering gear pumps, while engineers also completed a pre-departure checklist. The master also tested steering from the port bridge wing and told the pilot aboard that everything was “in good working order.” About 10 minutes after having gotten underway, the ship was making speeds up to 6.8 knots, and everything was going smoothly. The pilot released the escort tug, and the pilot and master ordered that maneuvering control (bow thruster, main propulsion engine control, and steering) be transferred from the port bridge wing to the main control station on the bridge. The chief officer pressed the button to activate the controls on the bridge. The pilot then gave a command for starboard 10, and the helmsman confirmed adjusting the rudder. Sensing the vessel was not turning at the expected rate, the pilot ordered starboard 20 and then hard to starboard. It was then that the chief officer realized the indicator light on the main control station had gone off and tried pressing it several times to reengage the controls. The rudder indicator was showing a hard port position of 30 degrees. The master then switched the vessel’s steering to emergency override mode and got the rudder back to 30 degrees starboard. The pilot also ordered full astern, and the master then put the bow thruster to 100 percent starboard thrust. However, it was too late, and they hit the docked bulker. Investigators were unable to replicate the failure, but working with the system manufacturer determined that a component failure had caused the system to fail. The company’s investigation found the rubber on the joystick (tiller) had invisible cracks that let moisture into the control unit, which contributed to the loss of the electrical signal. The shipping company, on advice from the manufacturer, changed the bridge wing steering control tillers, the “in command” push buttons, and the main power supply transformer. They made the same changes on two other vessels with similar control systems. The report says that the primary cause was the equipment failure. However, they also noted a stressful situation with short reaction time due to the vessel being in the confines of the port. The NTSB notes the crew had gone through training and regular drills, but recommended further training, saying that the delayed response from the ship’s crew to implement the emergency steering procedure from the bridge contributed to the vessel striking the docked bulker. The steering gear manufacturer also issued a safety bulletin. It highlighted incidents with systems manufactured between 2002 and 2009, noting that they had malfunctioned due to a weakness with the protective rubber and the micro switches. The bulletin said the consequence of the failing micro switches could lead to unintended rudder movement.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Video: Ukraine Damages Russian Missile Boat in the Sea of Azov,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-ukraine-damages-russian-missile-boat-in-the-sea-of-azov,,28/08/2025 18:22:36,,"Ukraine military intelligence has released a video showing one of its one-way attack aerial drones attacking a Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette in the Sea of Azov. The corvette was hit and damaged on August 28, but it is not yet clear if the vessel has been able to recover to port. Defence Intelligence of Ukraine strikes russian ""buyan-m"" corvette — a carrier of ""kalibr"" cruise missiles — in the Azov Sea : https://t.co/Q1lOahxlqy pic.twitter.com/SMPEc1b3Z6 The attack is noteworthy because of the location of the attack. The Sea of Azov is effectively a Russian lake, Ukraine having lost its control of coastline in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in 2022. Hence Ukraine will have had to fly the attack drone either through Russian land-based air defenses in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, or taken a longer route over the sea and around Crimea. The drone’s pilots will then need to have locked onto the target at this long range. Location of the corvette when struck in the Sea of Azov (45°42′N 35°18′E ) (Google Earth, Landsat Copernicus, CJRC) Ukraine has demonstrated it can do this against static targets at extreme range. However, to be able to do so against a moving target at long range is technically a considerable accomplishment. This should once again cause Russian naval commanders to consider the security of their naval assets even in ports far distant from Crimea such as Novorossiysk, to where vessels have already been pulled back for safety. The attack may have been mounted by Ukraine to demonstrate that it can control sea approaches to the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, which Russia has recently sought to open to foreign shipping. Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation) Buyan-M Class corvettes are primarily designed for littoral coastal defense, and are the mainstay of both what remains of the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. They are however armed with two vertical launch cells, each able to hold four Kalibr missiles. The Kalibr is designed to be an anti-ship weapon, but has frequently been used to hit ground targets in Ukraine. In its land-attack version, the Kalibr has a range of 1,500 miles, and can therefore hit targets anywhere in Ukraine form the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25

"UK, France and Germany Trigger UN ""Snapback"" Sanctions on Iran",https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-france-and-germany-trigger-un-snapback-sanctions-on-iran,,29/08/2025 06:00:05,,"The UK, Germany and France have followed in the footsteps of U.S. regulators and have reimposed ""snapback"" sanctions on Iran over its nuclear weapons program. The decision amounts to an end of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the 2015 multilateral agreement that is known in the U.S. as the ""Iran nuclear deal."" The UN Security Council unanimously approved the JCPOA, and international monitors found that for the next three years, Iran appeared to keep to the letter of the deal on uranium enrichment and nuclear R&D. However, its other military activities continued unabated, creating an ongoing and urgent concern for Iran's critics and neighbors. Though not nuclear per se, these activities - specifically Iran's accumulating missile stockpile, its involvement in civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and its provision of training and support for anti-American militias - had serious strategic implications. In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions on Iran, initiating a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran's economically-vital petroleum sector. One year later, Iran began breaching the terms of the agreement on enriched uranium and centrifuges, and it restricted international monitors' access to its nuclear sites. The UK, France and Germany tried to mediate, but did not immediately exit the deal. ""We acted in good faith to preserve the JCPoA, in the sincere hope of finding a way to resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue, while preserving the agreement and remaining within its framework,"" the three European nations (together, the E3) said in a joint statement. In July 2025, in a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, the E3 proposed to extend its terms if Iran would meet several criteria, beginning with inspections and resumption of negotiations. Iran did not agree, and the E3 concluded that ""Iran's non-compliance with the JCPoA is clear and deliberate."" The E3 have decided to notify the UN Security Council that Iran is not following its commitments under the deal, activating the ""snapback"" mechanism that reimposes UN sanctions. ""If the UNSC does not adopt within 30 days a resolution to continue the lifting of UNSC resolutions on Iran, six Security Council resolutions, including on sanctions, will be restored,"" the E3 noted. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the announcement and said that it was a prelude to renewed negotiations. In a statement, Rubio said that ""snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it."" The UN sanctions that are set to enter into renewed effect will reimpose an arms embargo, an overseas asset freeze, a travel ban, limits on ballistic missile programs, and restrictions on nuclear technology. These limits could reinforce the economic effects of the U.S. government's unilateral ""maximum pressure"" sanctions regime. Iran's currency, the rial, fell abruptly after the E3's announcement, reflecting market expectations of additional economic pressure. In a statement Thursday, the Iranian government called the E3's actions a ""provocative and unnecessary escalation,"" and pledged to respond. ""Iran has acted responsibly and in good faith in adhering to diplomacy for resolving nuclear-related issues,"" asserted Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a statement. The current status of its nuclear program is opaque, as UN experts have been banned from its sites, and Iran denies that it has intentions of producing a nuclear bomb. But as of May - before a series of Israeli and American airstrikes - it was believed to possess enough high-enriched uranium to produce nine nuclear weapons. To achieve a nuclear breakout, Iran would still need to develop a working weapon design, and would have to process its uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal for fabrication.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Nord Stream Suspect Also Under Investigation for Tanker Attack in Italy,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nord-stream-suspect-also-under-investigation-for-tanker-attack-in-italy,,29/08/2025 04:14:25,,"The Ukrainian military veteran arrested last week in connection with the Nord Stream pipeline attack is also under investigation for involvement in the blast that hit the tanker Seajewel, according to Italian media reports. Serhii Kuzientsov, an ex-Ukrainian special forces soldier, was detained in the Italian resort town of Rimini last week by the Carabinieri. He has an outstanding warrant in Germany for involvement in the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream pipeline system, which badly damaged three out of the four Russian gas lines under the Baltic. According to Corriere della Sera, Kuzientsov had driven to Rimini in a car with Ukrainian plates, accompanied by his family, and had registered for lodging under his own name - hardly attempting to evade detection. Kuzientsov faces extradition to Germany to stand trial for charges related to the Nord Stream attack, and he is fighting that process in court. At a hearing on Monday, he told the Bologna Court of Appeal that he was in Ukraine at the time of the Nord Stream attack, and denied any knowledge of it. He is in detention while the legal process moves forward, according to Corriere de Bologna - but there is a possibility that he could also be charged in Italy for a separate incident. Prosecutors in Genoa have been conducting a terrorism investigation in connection with the attack on a crude oil tanker at Savona in February, and have previously told local media that they suspect a Ukrainian nexus. The vessel, Seajewel, is one of seven tankers that were hit by mysterious explosions in the first half of the year. All previously carried Russian cargoes, prompting speculation over possible Ukrainian involvement; Ukraine has invested significant resources in attacking the Russian energy industry, which is the financial foundation of the ongoing invasion. The Genoa investigation is looking into Kuzientsov's potential involvement in the attack on the Seajewel, according to Corriere della Sera. That inquiry is ongoing, and could lead to additional charges of wrecking a vessel with an aggravating factor of terrorist intent. Other arrests could be coming: German authorities have identified five more suspected accomplices in connection with the Nord Stream attacks, and have filed at least one other outstanding warrant.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Crowley Replaces Fire-Damaged Tanker to Support US Tanker Security Program,https://maritime-executive.com/article/crowley-replaces-fire-damaged-tanker-to-support-us-tanker-security-program,,29/08/2025 02:21:19,,"Nearly six months after the tragic incident in which one of the tankers Crowley manages for the US’s Tanker Security Program was damaged after it was hit by a containership, the shipping manager reports it has received US permission for a replacement. The program administered by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is critical as it transports fuel supplies for the U.S. Department of Defense. Crowley Stena Marine Solutions, the joint venture between Crowley and Stena Bulk, reports that MARAD recently approved operating the MR tanker CS Anthem under the Tanker Security Program. The companies note that the vessel will advance the nation’s strategic sealift capabilities. ""The addition of the CS Anthem demonstrates our commitment to strengthening U.S. maritime security and providing reliable, U.S.-crewed tanker capacity in support of national defense,"" said Tucker Gilliam, vice president of fleet operations for Crowley Shipping. ""Together with Stena Bulk, we are proud to continue advancing solutions that serve both commercial and government energy transportation needs."" The new vessel is largely a swap with the same characteristics as the damaged ship. Built in 2017, CS Anthem had been operating for India’s Scorpio. It is 49,990 dwt compared with 49,729 dwt for the Stena Immaculate, which was also built in 2017, and which it replaces. The databases show CS Antheim was recently transferred to the U.S. flag from the Marshall Islands and now has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida. Crowley is responsible for crewing and managing the tanker under a bareboat charter through the joint venture. The company also manages the tankers Stena Imperative and Stena Impeccable in the Tanker Security Program. Stena Immaculate was anchored off the east coast of England after transporting a cargo of jet fuel. It was waiting for its berth when the containership Solong hit the tanker at anchor. The resulting fire engulfed both vessels, but Crowley’s crew acted heroically, starting fire suppression systems before they were safely evacuated. The tanker survived with portions of its cargo intact. They arranged for another tanker to receive the fuel, and the damaged vessel was towed to Great Yarmouth in the UK, where it appears to still be berthed. The Solong recently arrived at a recycling yard in Belgium, while the master of the vessel is facing trial for the incident that killed one of the crewmembers aboard the containership.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Vanguard Tech Launches Digital CSO Product to Address Insecurity at Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vanguard-tech-launches-digital-cso-product-to-address-insecurity-at-sea,,29/08/2025 02:17:28,,"[By Vanguard Tech] As Red Sea insecurity reshapes global shipping routes, Vanguard Tech has launched a first-of-its-kind 'Digital CSO' to assist CSOs in managing risk, resilience, and response at sea. Triggered by ongoing insecurity in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and a growing need to provide seafarers with more than just traditional routing guidance, Vanguard Tech has unveiled its new 'Digital CSO' product, a first-of-its-kind digital Company Security Officer (CSO) solution designed to assist CSOs and give shipping companies live visibility, faster decision-making, and stronger protection in the world's most volatile waters. The product, developed over the last 18 months, encompasses complete end-to-end maritime risk management; from the initial planning stages, all the way through to safe arrival. With the Vanguard Tech Digital Platform anchoring the service, Digital CSO is designed to Assess, Alert, Advise, Act, and Assure. Digital CSO redefines vessel risk through a fully integrated AI-driven platform. The product is available to clients on a tiered basis – ensuring scalable support for fleets of all sizes – and encompasses elements ranging from maritime intelligence, digital tracking, SSAS alerting, closed-loop tracking, annual ISPS-compliant emergency drills, and access to the new Vanguard AI insurance platform. Although the product is applicable globally, some elements have been individually tailored to particular high-risk areas. For example, amidst ongoing Houthi targeting of vessels, the affiliation assessments can give assurances to all stakeholders – from owners to insurers – that vessels can transit high-risk areas safely. Benjamin Simonson, Vanguards Head of Operations said, ""For years, the CSO's duties were carried out in a traditional way. With Vanguard's Digital CSO, we're not replacing that role but empowering it with advanced technology. It's now about live insights, data-driven accountability, and continuous monitoring. By bringing risk intelligence, tracking, and communication together in one platform, shipping companies can make faster, more accurate decisions. The result is fewer delays, stronger compliance, and greater protection where it matters most. For the first time, Vanguard is delivering end-to-end digital risk management for shipping - fully automated, seamless, and designed to give operators, managers, and owners true peace of mind."" The launch comes at a time of heightened global maritime disruption, with shipping seeking smarter, technology-driven solutions to navigate risks such as piracy, conflict spillover, and sanctions exposure. With security conditions in key maritime chokepoints deteriorating, Vanguard positions Digital CSO as a transformational solution for shipping companies — providing not just compliance, but proactive resilience, operational assurance, and safer seas.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
North Carolina Utility Cites Costs Deferring Offshore Wind Power for Solar,https://maritime-executive.com/article/north-carolina-utility-cites-costs-deferring-offshore-wind-power-for-solar,,29/08/2025 01:55:25,,"Duke Energy, which is one of the United States’ largest energy companies, has determined that offshore wind energy does not offer a cost advantage over solar power for North Carolina. The determination came as the utility was planning its long-term power sources and is based on proposals from the current leaseholders for offshore wind in North Carolina. Headquartered in North Carolina, the company operates utilities in the Southeast as well as the Midwest. Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy. As part of this review, it was instructed to request estimates from the three leaseholders for the development of up to 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. Duke, through its non-regulated subsidiary Cinergy, holds one of the leases that it was awarded in 2022. The project known as Carolina Long Bay is 22 miles south of Bald Head Island and could support up to approximately 1.6 GW. Neighboring Carolina Long Bay is TotalEnergies, which has the potential for 1.6 GW, and the two companies have explored collaborations. A third offshore site available to Duke is Avangrid’s Kitty Hawk South, which was awarded in 2017. The company originally said it could produce up to 2.4 GW, but in 2022 sold the northern portion of its lease to Dominion Energy. The three developers submitted a total of eight proposals, Duke reports in a filing to the Utilities Commission. It was looking for the projects to be developed by 2035. In the filing submitted on August 11, Duke informed the commission that, based on its review, it determined solar and battery storage was cheaper in every instance. The company reports it was comparing the cost of building 3,576 MW of solar panels and 3,440 MW of battery storage capacity. A spokesperson for the company told North Carolina Public Radio that they determined “offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time.” The commission had instructed Duke that if the proposals were cost-competitive, to proceed with a binding request for proposals. Supporters of wind energy were quick to criticize the review, noting that solar only provides power 30 to 40 percent of the time, whereas wind energy can generate between 80 and 90 percent of the time. They said they were “disappointed” that Duke was not proceeding, highlighting that it would require at least a decade before construction and commercial operations could be realized. “The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the public radio station WUNC. Duke Energy is aggressively pursuing solar energy in Florida. The company reported last month that it currently owns, operates, and maintains a portfolio of more than 25 solar sites across Florida that generate approximately 1.5 GW, and between 2025 and 2027, the company plans to build 12 new solar sites, adding 900 megawatts. By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects it will have over 6.1 GW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online. The company is reviewing its North Carolina plans. In a 2024 plan, it showed up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035. Another model included as much as 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. The planning study was undertaken before the Trump administration’s latest moves against the offshore wind energy sector. In addition to its ending leasing, the administration is now starting a national security review. It has also curtailed tax credits and other incentives for offshore wind energy development.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel has been attacked about 56 nautical miles south of Lome. The ship in question is ""highly likely"" to be the chemical tanker Endo Ponente, the firm reported. AIS data provided by Pole Star shows that Endo Ponente got under way from an anchorage off Lome on the morning of August 28 and headed due south, making 6-7 knots. At about 1830, she made a round turn to starboard and her speed dropped to less than a knot. Her last AIS transmission was received half an hour later. Endo Ponente is a 2010-built chemical tanker flagged in Malta. The operator has been contacted for comment.

Australia Awards More Preliminary Feasibility Licenses for Offshore Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australia-awards-more-preliminary-feasibility-licenses-for-offshore-wind,,29/08/2025 00:58:16,,"The Australian government reports it is continuing to push forward with efforts to spur development for offshore wind energy. In its latest step, it awarded two additional preliminary feasibility licenses, both going to groups backed by European majors, for what could become the first offshore wind farms in the Indian Ocean. The move comes as some of the major European corporations have stalled their efforts in Australia or withdrawn. Last week, it was revealed that Equinor will not be accepting its feasibility license for a proposed project that would have involved floating wind turbines off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The company reportedly could not reach an agreement with its local partner Oceanex, while last month it also withdrew from a project planned for the Bass Strait. Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, called the new licenses being awarded another important step for the industry in Western Australia. He highlighted that “Western Australia needs some 50 GW of additional generation by 2042.” The zone located south of Perth was declared in September 2024, with the government saying it could provide as much as 11.4 GW of renewable energy. The first of the licenses was awarded to Oceanex Energy, which is planning a project in the northern part of the zone, but awards for the southern portion of the zone were delayed while two developers could resolve an overlap between their plans. One of the new licenses went to a group backed by France’s EFP Group. It is planning the Bunbury Offshore Wind South project. Ocean Winds, a partnership between Spain’s EDP Renewables and France’s ENGIE is also receiving a preliminary license for its Westward Wind project. The preliminary licenses permit the companies to continue planning efforts. They are also required to meet with the indigenous people, which Australia calls “traditional owners.” The companies will later apply for the full feasibility permits. A third project, called Wind With Purpose, is still pursuing discussions with a potential Tier 1 partner, it told ABC News Australia. The government deferred granting it a preliminary feasibility license. Minister Bowen said in a statement, “Australia’s offshore wind industry is progressing, with feasibility licenses granted for projects targeting a total of 24.21 GW of renewable energy and preliminary offers for another 4 GW.” He told ABC News that there is more to come, referencing the ongoing efforts to push forward the offshore wind industry.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

At a meeting for foreign ambassadors ahead of India Maritime Week, Union minister for shipping Sarbananda Sonowal pitched a $1 trillion ""roadmap"" for public and private investment in the nation's critical infrastructure. Speaking to representatives from 28 nations, Sonowal said that India is working to transform and modernize its ports, logistics and shipping systems. ""These opportunities open up a $1 trillion maritime investment roadmap, with strong potential for joint ventures in developing ports and cargo terminal operations, multi-modal terminals, maritime services, shipbuilding, ship recycling and ship repairs, green hydrogen hubs, and sustainable shipping solutions,"" he said. To get ready, India's government has been overhauling the nation's maritime legal structure to bring it up to date and align it with international standards, making the country more accessible for foreign shipping investors. Five newly-passed legislative acts - the Bills of Lading Act, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Merchant Shipping Act, Coastal Shipping Act, and Indian Ports Act - are all part of a plan to update laws that date back to the era of British governance. The investment pitch delved into specifics of opportunities for foreign partners. Port investors could spend on projects like Vadhavan Port, a gigantic transshipment-focused container port in Maharashtra with a proposed nameplate capacity of 23 million TEU at full buildout - enough to double India's entire container-handling capacity. Other opportunities include Galathea Bay Transshipment Port, a large-scale container facility planned in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and Tuna Tekra Terminal, a two million TEU container port on India's west coast, operated by DP World. The government is also looking to attract investors for LNG bunkering hubs, industrial parks and green fuel infrastructure.

Tsuneishi’s China Shipyard Launches Next-Gen Methanol Containership,https://maritime-executive.com/article/tsuneishi-s-china-shipyard-launches-next-gen-methanol-containership,,28/08/2025 23:59:23,,"The Chinese shipyard in the Tsuneishi Shipbuilding group marked a milestone on August 27 as it floated the first of its next-generation energy-efficient methanol dual-fuel containership. The vessel is also the largest container vessel built by the Tsuneishi Group and part of its efforts to build leadership in methanol-fueled vessels. The newly launched containership will have a capacity of 5,915 TEU. The yard also notes that in response to the growing demand for refrigerated transport in recent years, the vessel can also carry up to 1,400 reefer containers. The name of the vessel and its details were not released by the yard, but the blue livery and funnel markings are distinctive. Maersk is currently completing the introduction of its large, 16,000-plus TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships and in 2023 reported it had also entered a contract with Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group for six 9,000 TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships due doe delivery in late 2026 and to be completed by March 2027. Maersk’s fleet strategy announced in August 2024 called for orders reaching a total of 50 to 60 vessels, equaling 800,000 TEU for delivery between 2026 and 2030. Tsuneishi highlights its new class of vessels incorporates an improved hull form and the group’s proprietary energy-saving technology, MT-FAST, an energy-saving device that improves propulsion efficiency by approximately four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. They also highlight the vessel employing a concept known as a “final solution” towards achieving zero CO2 emissions. It will be capable of using green methanol as its primary fuel. The main engine and also the on-board generators – including the HiMSEN engine (8H32DF-LM) manufactured by HD Hyundai – are capable of operating on methanol fuel. It also adopts a large-capacity shaft generator that enables what Tsuneiship says will be “outstanding fuel efficiency.” It is also designed for shore power. Assembly of the first of the new ships began in April 2025. The vessel launched this week is scheduled for delivery in February 2026. Tsuneishi Shipbuilding says it will continue to advance the practical application of methanol dual-fuelled vessels. In July, the group’s yard in the Philippines launched the world’s first methanol dual-fueled Kamsarmax, and before that, in May, it introduced a methanol dual-fueled Ultramax built at its yard in Japan.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Op-Ed: Shipping Must Evolve to Support Neurodivergent Seafarers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-shipping-must-evolve-to-support-neurodivergent-seafarers,,28/08/2025 23:50:06,,"Whilst the maritime industry continues to adapt to change, one aspect of workforce inclusion is still widely overlooked - neurodiversity. With latest statistics suggesting nearly 20 percent of the global population is neurodivergent, this is not a segment of our society we can simply ignore. The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to the natural differences in how people experience, process, and respond to the world around them. It includes a range of cognitive profiles such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. Autism, for example, is a developmental condition that affects how individuals communicate, interact, and process sensory information. Common traits may include differences in social communication, a preference for routine, sensory sensitivities, and intense focus on specific interests. While these can present challenges in some environments, they also contribute valuable strengths such as attention to detail, reliability, and creative problem-solving. To date, the prevalence among seafarers is unknown. Seafaring is already a demanding profession, with long contracts, unpredictable conditions, isolation from family, and confined living spaces testing the resilience of even the most seasoned professionals. For neurodivergent seafarers, these pressures can be more difficult to manage and often involve additional, less visible challenges. Simultaneously, the idiosyncratic nature of seafaring - with its need for attention to detail, particular social structure, routine onboard, and need for intense focus and problem-solving skills - may appeal to neurodivergent individuals. Despite growing awareness of neurodiversity in other industries, maritime is still in the early stages of recognizing exactly how neurodivergence can affect life at sea. Many operational structures, such as overstimulating environments and training practices, are designed around neurotypical norms. In some cases, cultural attitudes and stigma towards neurodivergence can make matters worse. Misunderstandings or a lack of awareness may lead to unfair assumptions or behavior and, in some cases, even discourage individuals from being open about their needs. This is not just an issue of wellbeing. It also influences safety, retention and long-term career development. Neurodivergent individuals often bring highly valuable skills to maritime roles, such as thinking, problem-solving, pattern recognition, and deep focus. These strengths align with the increasing complexity of maritime operations, particularly in safety and technical environments. However, when understanding and support are lacking, this potential is often overlooked. In April an industry-first initiative by NeurodiversAtSea, the Seafarers Hospital Society and The Seafarers’ Charity was launched. The program is designed to provide tailored support to neurodivergent seafarers and to better understand how maritime environments can evolve to be more inclusive. This is a meaningful step forward, and a strong signal that change is both possible and necessary. That said, progress cannot rest on a few initiatives alone. Industry-wide commitment is essential. There is still a significant gap in data. Without targeted research into the lived experiences of neurodivergent seafarers, it is difficult to develop meaningful support. Strategies must be grounded in evidence rather than assumptions. It is equally important to build disclosure-safe environments. Many seafarers may avoid disclosing neurodivergence due to fear of judgment, limited understanding or the risk of being at a professional disadvantage. Creating a culture of safety and acceptance is essential. People must feel as though they are able to express their needs without any concern for negative consequences or reactions. Training must also improve. Neurodiversity awareness should be included in programs at every level, from cadets to senior leadership. This involves understanding communication differences and adapting daily practices to support all aspects of neurodiversity. Too often, we hear from people who speak confidently about issues they have never personally faced. While intentions may be sincere, policies or initiatives shaped without direct input from those affected often overlook the reality of daily experience. As younger generations enter the workforce, this conversation becomes even more urgent. Many young professionals are more likely to identify as neurodivergent or expect employers to support cognitive diversity. Inclusion is no longer optional. It is a key factor in attracting and retaining future talent. At OneCare Group, we support maritime organizations in making this a reality. Through our Neurodiversity and ADHD Awareness Initiative, we provide the resources and guidance necessary to help ensure that neurodivergent seafarers are not simply accommodated but supported to thrive in every role, both at sea and ashore. By shifting from policy to practice, and from awareness to advocacy, we can drive a more inclusive maritime culture, one where diversity fuels safety, innovation, and human performance. Marinos Kokkinis is Managing Director at OneCare Group.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Report: Lürssen’s Naval Shipbuilder Target for German Defense Consolidation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-luerssen-s-naval-shipbuilder-target-for-german-defense-consolidation,,28/08/2025 22:53:21,,"Media reports in Germany are highlighting the potential for the sale of the shipbuilder NVL (Naval Vessels Lürssen) to defense industry major Rheinmetall as part of the further consolidation in the defense sector. The German government is reported to be encouraging the industry to explore steps to enhance its capabilities to meet the country’s urgent needs. Rheinmetall, a manufacturer of tanks and ammunition, has in the past expressed interest in entering the naval shipbuilding sector. The company is now reported to be in discussions with NVL to acquire the operation, which is one of Germany’s leading naval shipbuilders. The supervisory board of Rheinmetall is reported to be set to discuss the acquisition, writes the German newspaper Bild. The news outlet NDR followed up on the reports by speaking with the company’s CEO during an event on Wednesday, August 27. NDR reports he responded by saying, “We are always interested in expanding our product portfolio...We will only talk about it once decisions have been made.” The German government has been encouraging the industry to explore opportunities while saying it needs to increase the country’s defense capabilities and to do so quickly. NVL is a current partner in the new frigate program with Damen that has become mired in problems with its electronics. Germany’s defense ministry has said it will look to rapidly grow its naval operations based on the increased dangers in the Baltic and North Sea. The German Press Agency (dpa) reports Lürssen sent a letter to its workforce saying, in response to the needs of the government, it has “decided to intensify consolidation talks.” Bild reports that the family that controls Lürssen is looking to focus on the company’s yacht shipbuilding operation. The group separated in 2021, putting Lürssen’s yacht and naval businesses into independent units. Lürssen also recently completed the sale in June of its naval shipbuilding operation in Australia to the local company Civmec. NVL is the product of consolidation in the naval shipbuilding sector. Lürssen and German Naval Yards Keil agreed in 2020 to consolidate their operations. NVL’s operations now consist of four leading yards, including Peene-Werft in Wolgast and Blohm+Voss in Hamburg. Norderwerft in Hamburg and Neue Jadewerft in Wilhelmshaven are dedicated to repairs, refits, and modernisations of naval vessels and auxiliary ships. The products include a specialization in corvettes and patrol boats as well as frigates, minesweepers, and coast guard vessels, both domestically and internationally. TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems) and German Naval Yards are the other two large competitors in the sector. Media reports suggest that Rheinmetall was one of the potential suitors that also looked at TKMS as Thyssenkrupp was considering alternatives for the company before settling on the plan to spin off the naval shipbuilder later this year to shareholders.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
"Study: Maritime Industry is Trying Out AI, But is Still Skeptical",https://maritime-executive.com/article/study-maritime-industry-is-trying-out-ai-but-is-still-skeptical,,28/08/2025 21:58:59,,"Maritime companies are enthusiastic about AI's potential for streamlining business and operational tasks, but are struggling to move beyond small-scale experiments, according to a new industry study by Marcura and Thetius. The study found that 82 percent of maritime professionals are optimistic about AI's role in their sector, but nearly two-thirds worry that over-reliance on the technology could erode critical human skills and judgment. The overwhelming majority believe that AI tools still need human oversight to make sure that they perform as needed - and it's clear that AI will need human input for data collection, data labeling and prompts, in addition to human evaluation of the outputs. The study, which surveyed more than 130 maritime professionals and conducted in-depth interviews, paints a picture of an industry caught between promise and reality. Though 81 percent of companies are running AI pilot projects, only 11 percent have established formal policies to guide how these technologies should be scaled across their operations. The research identified clear consensus on AI's most promising applications. Nearly all respondents — 97 percent — see benefits in reducing manual workflow inefficiencies, while 87 percent believe AI can improve charter party contract analysis and help spot potential pitfalls. However, more than two-thirds of respondents — 69 percent — expressed concerns that AI solutions might miss critical warning signs in contracts or voyage planning, potentially leading to costly business mistakes. 37 percent said they had personally witnessed AI failures in their organizations, and nearly a quarter of respondents said that AI vendors' claims often fail to match real-world results, The specialized nature of maritime operations are a key factor in these implementation challenges. As anyone in maritime who has tried to use ChatGPT knows, generic AI tools often struggle with the sector's idiosyncratic terms and acronyms, its unique rules and its operational realities - all of which are a foreign language and culture that outsiders have to learn, including software outsiders. ""A general AI agent might interpret 'SF' as 'standard form,' but in shipping, it means 'stowage factor,'"" explained Janani Yagnamurthy, vice president of analytics at Marcura. ""Off-the-shelf solutions might automate basic processes, but they miss the nuanced context that maritime professionals rely on."" The skepticism about AI was highest for legal and compliance tasks; though the legal profession as a whole has adopted widespread use of AI for basic tasks, shipping respondents rated their compliance departments as least-suited for AI usage at present, citing concerns about data governance, regulatory liability and misinterpretation of legal nuances by AI. Maritime-specific, purpose built AI agents may perform better than generic tools for these tasks. Marcura says that its AI-powered contract analysis tools recently helped a dry bulk operator avoid more than $120,000 in potential losses by identifying missing clauses in the draft of an agreement. Despite successes in specific applications, most companies are still just testing the waters, and only 17 percent have established transparent processes for how AI systems inform decisionmaking in their companies. ""When change happens, it's very natural to fear losing control,"" Yagnamurthy said. ""Skilled maritime professionals have spent decades honing their judgment in high-stakes roles. The best AI functions like a co-pilot, not a replacement."" Familiarity and fluency with AI will also need improvement: 38 percent reported that inadequate training is the biggest barrier to scaling up the use of the technology in their business. Poor implementation and poor education of the users can lead to poor outcomes, multiple respondents said. ""People train their AI models but they don’t train their people. If the crew and the office do not understand the AI outputs, it could lead to misuse, which creates mistrust. We need to first train our people and our minds,"" one shipmanager told the research team.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

Pirates Scared Off from Tanker Attack by Approaching Togolese Patrol Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pirates-scared-off-from-tanker-attack-by-approaching-togolese-patrol-boat,,29/08/2025 19:43:40,,"The suspected attack on a small chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in West Africa is over, with the crew reported to be safe and AIS signals showing the vessel underway. The incident took place approximately 60 nautical miles south of Lome, Togo, but details remain unclear. The joint French–British monitoring operation Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) records the incident as concluded and lists it as a small vessel coming in close proximity to the tanker, which has been identified in other reports as the Endo Ponete (7,250 dwt) registered in Malta. Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel had been attacked and termed it an attempted boarding, while Ambrey called it a boarding incident. The vessel was getting underway from Togo and southbound for the Democratic Republic of Congo when the small boat approached. Vanguard reports the captain ordered the crew to muster and enter the citadel, and they notified the local authorities. A Togolese patrol boat was dispatched, and according to the reports, the pirates fled when they saw the approaching naval support. The vessel was searched, and the crew was released from the citadel. There are no reports of damage, but it is unclear if the vessel was boarded. Built in 2010, the tanker, which is 95 meters (312 feet) in length, is reported to have been operating in the region since being acquired by Endo Tankers in June 2023. It previously operated as the Mandume, registered in the Marshall Islands. Product tankers have emerged as a favored target of the pirates in the region. In April, a product tanker was boarded and robbed while off the Nigerian coast, and in the past, product tankers have been robbed of fuel in the region near Cote d’Ivoire. In March, a product tanker was robbed and crewmembers kidnapped further south off the Central African coast. MDAT-GoG reports this is the first incident in the region in at least 90 days. It reported a rash of incidents in the March and April timeframe, but overall, serious crime against merchant ships has been dramatically reduced after peaking in 2020 in the Gulf of Guinea region.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 20:56:46

Ukraine’s Navy confirmed an attack, reporting the death toll has risen to two sailors, while others are missing or injured. Neither side released extensive details, but reports are identifying the vessel as the Simferopol, a reconnaissance vessel built in Ukraine in 2019 based on a trawler. The vessel is 1,220 tons displacement and about 55 meters (180 feet) in length and was designed for 29 crew. It was outfitted with electronic intelligence and surveillance equipment in support of the Ukrainian Navy’s operations. The vessel was reported to be operating in the Danube Delta region when it was struck on August 28. Russia’s statement claimed the vessel was sunk, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy today on television said they could not confirm that the vessel had sunk.

They declined to say how many sailors are missing or injured, with the spokesperson emphasizing that most of the sailors were safe. They said the Russian naval drones were known and that there had been attempts in the past to deploy them in the Black Sea. This was the first known successful attack using the naval drones. Ukraine has successfully deployed a range of naval and aerial drones during the campaign, inflicting a range of losses on the Russian Navy and support vessels. Yesterday, Ukraine claimed that it had successfully attacked a Russian naval vessel deep inside Crimea in what was being described as a bold attack far behind enemy lines. Last month, a Ukrainian dredger working in the Danube reportedly struck a mine, killing three crewmembers. The canal connecting to the Danube was closed for weeks before it reopened.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 20:56:46

Evolving Role for Ship Managers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/evolving-role-for-ship-managers,,30/08/2025 03:53:38,,"Ship management is often identified as a tool for smaller fleets or individual shipowners to run their ships and keep up with the majors. The leading ship managers, however, say the practice is evolving from technical skills to incorporate consulting and advising as the shipping business is confronted with new challenges ranging from geopolitical issues to emerging technologies, increasing regulations and a shortage of seafarers. The emergence of the ship management industry was driven by a basic desire to achieve cost efficiencies, often through scale, while also ensuring regulatory compliance - all to permit owners to focus on the commercial rather than technical aspects of operations. Historically, ship management was mostly used by owners with smaller portfolios who lacked in-house expertise and found value in outsourcing. ""It's been an industry driven by standardized solutions designed to streamline operations and costs,"" says Mark O'Neil, CEO of Columbia Group. The model was designed, however, for a more stable and predictable era, when owners could rely on internal resources and conventional advisory partnerships to navigate relatively stable markets and regulatory environments. Despite rapid growth and increasing demands on shipowners, ship management companies only handle about 20 percent of the global commercial fleet. The other 80 percent, notes Niraj Nanda, Chief Commercial Officer of Anglo-Eastern, which has been in the business for over 50 years, is managed in-house. Integrated Approach As ships have gotten bigger and economic pressures have increased, the scope of work for ship managers has changed. Today, it requires an integrated approach to ensure safety, efficiency and regulatory compliance, according to Lisa Holum, Managing Director of OSM Thome Singapore. Tracing its roots back to the 1963 founding of Thome in Singapore and formed by the 2023 merger with OSM Maritime Group, OSM Thome encompasses not only technical management but also crew, compliance, procurement and sustainability initiatives. ""The ship management industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from being a cost-based, task-oriented service to becoming a strategic value partner to shipowners,"" explains Ajay Chaudhry, Co-CEO – Ship Management, Synergy Marine Group. ""At Synergy, we believe the practice is being reshaped by three forces: regulatory pressure, technological maturity and rising expectations around crew wellbeing."" Emerging regulations around decarbonization and crew safety, for example, mean ship management is shifting from an operations focus to a value focus. The role of a ship manager is being fundamentally redefined with a shift towards risk mitigation, creating strategic advantages and providing access to specialized capabilities that owners cannot easily develop in-house. ""Owners give their vessels to a third-party manager so they can focus on their core competence of managing their vessels commercially while the manager specializes in operating ships efficiently and safely,"" says Ioannis Stefanou, Managing Director, Ship Management at Wallem Group. ""When we partner with an owner, we don't just manage their vessels. We also offer consultancy advice and added value services to take care of their very expensive assets."" The pressures on shipowners are driving many of the changes in the industry. ""Ship management is moving towards more of a global solution,"" says Captain Kuba Szymanski, General Secretary of InterManager, the only organization dedicated to representing the ship management industry. ""New requirements are making the role of a ship manager more like a business partner and not just a service provider."" Owners expect managers to deliver not only operational excellence but also guidance on decarbonization, digital solutions, regulatory compliance and crew challenges. ""We're moving beyond traditional ship management to offer a fully integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, energy and offshore services platform,"" highlights Columbia's O'Neil, noting that Columbia takes a holistic approach, combining digital tools, maritime HR, AI, sustainability and more. Ownership Changes Further driving change is a shift in the ownership profile of the shipping industry. In addition to the emergence of massive fleets, shipping has become more specialized with unique vessels for each segment and new types of owners. Capt. Szymanski of Inter- Manager notes ship managers already occupy the ""top end,"" serving LNG, LPG and tankers, but he sees the service ""now drifting toward"" bulk carriers and containerships. Other sectors, including ro-ros, passenger vessels and cruise ships, have also turned to outside managers, especially as they enter new markets. Ownership is moving from the traditional private families and legacy fleets to institutional investors, energy majors and first-time entrants who expect enterprise-grade governance, sustainability credentials and strategic alignment. ""We see a notable increase in leasing companies purchasing vessels, both newbuilds and resale tonnage, and then chartering them out on long-term or bareboat terms,"" says OSM Thome's Holum, who notes these new entrants rely on third-party managers. ""Many of these lessors are financial institutions without in-house technical management expertise."" The new owners include private equity firms and other non-maritime investors as well. Adds Anglo-Eastern's Nanda: ""These new stakeholders often lack operational expertise in ship management, creating opportunities for ship managers to provide end-to-end solutions."" Crew Scarcity Stricter environmental regulations, rapid technological advances, geopolitical instability and economic volatility have meant that managing a ship has never been more complex. However, the biggest challenge across all sectors of the industry may be crew scarcity and the related issues of aging seafarers and low participation rates from traditional sources of seafarers. The U.N.-led Maritime Just Transition Task Force recently highlighted that hundreds of thousands of seafarers must also be upskilled to prepare for the handling of methanol and then ammonia and hydrogen as future alternative fuels. The largest ship managers operate their own training centers, and some run pre-sea training programs. Anglo- Eastern, for example, has expanded its simulation-based training facilities with the leading engine companies - MAN Energy Solutions (now Everllence), WinGD and Wärtsilä - and launched the industry's first LNG/Ammonia bunkering station skid at its Maritime Institute in Mumbai, India. ""A ship is only as good as the crew we can place on it,"" says Sebastian von Hardenberg, CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. ""As we introduce future fuels to the maritime sector, safeguarding the crew and the vessels they operate through proper training must come first."" The company is taking proactive steps to close the skills gap, investing in training programs, simulation technology and collaborative forums. It established internal expert groups to design vessel-specific training modules covering everything from bunkering and emergency response to cargo handling protocols. In 2024, BSM launched its Smart Academy program to give undergraduate cadets training in a controlled and realistic work environment onshore and onboard, including training on a bridge simulator. Wallem has an in-house saying that ""The ships of the future will not be managed by the managers of the past."" It notes that new skills are required as digitalization spreads through shipping. ""The young generation of seafarers is tech savvy and computer skills come naturally to them,"" says Stefanou. Wallem has set up training for the use of methanol and ammonia and helped customers with wind-assisted propul- sion. With a focus on crew wellbeing, it conducted over 7,000 hours of training in 2024 and has a ""Mental Health Wellbeing Champion” onboard every ship. Anglo-Eastern's Nanda says, ""Attracting and retaining skilled seafarers remains a pressing issue, requiring innovative recruitment and training strategies."" In June, the company launched its Mission 30 initiative with the goal of increasing the proportion of management-level officers under the age of 30 from one percent to 30 percent by 2030. Next Challenges ""Owners increasingly need advisors who understand global complexity and can act as strategic partners, not just service providers,"" concludes Columbia's O'Neil. ""The next big challenges include talent retention, the mental health of seafarers, geopolitical instability and generational shifts in expectations. Ship managers must evolve from reactive support to proactive problem-solvers."" All the companies point to their efforts to develop specialized services and teams to address the emerging challenges. V. Group, for example, launched V.ERDE to address decarbonization while OSM Thome launched its green services division, EVIGO. Bernhard Schulte introduced LiveFleet, a single data source platform to monitor compliance with regulations, while Anglo-Eastern, through its newbuilding and project management divisions - Anglo-Eastern Technical Services (AETS) and SeaQuest - is expanding its involvement in future-fuel ship design. ""Beyond fuel and emissions, the next frontier of challenges lies in managing operational complexity, specifically around data governance, workforce transformation and asset lifecycle alignment,"" says Synergy's Chaudhry. ""Owners today are overwhelmed with compliance obligations, ESG disclosures and performance benchmarking, often across multiple jurisdictions and systems. The ship manager's role is no longer operational alone. It's increasingly strategic helping owners anticipate disruption, adapt with agility and remain competitive in a rapidly changing seascape."" Lifecycle Custodians Ship managers must now serve as ""lifecycle custodians,"" expanding their services to encompass broader challenges. To protect the financial interests of their clients, managers must advise on a growing range of issues to help guide owners through the dynamic maritime industry and anticipate the challenges that lie ahead. – MarEx Allan Jordan is the magazine's Associate Editor This article originally appeared in the July-August 2025 issue of The Maritime Executive.

Built in 1943 in Ohio by the American Ship Building Company, Cuyahoga was a historic bulk freighter launched as the J. Burton Ayers to transport iron ore during World War II. She was later converted into a self-unloading ship and was renamed Cuyahoga in 1995 by Lower Lakes Towing, part of Rand Logistics. Her original steam plant was finally converted to diesel in 2000, and she continued to maintain seasonal services on the Lakes transporting dry bulk commodities like coal, salt, grain, and crushed stone. On May 23, 2023, the Cuyahoga left Marblehead, Ohio, on a regular voyage bound for Kingsville. Three hours into the voyage, a fire ignited in the engine room, forcing the 20 crewmembers to initiate emergency responses. The 620-foot (189-meter) vessel was loaded with 11,400 metric tonnes of granular crushed stone. To avert a disaster, the crew responded by cutting the fuel supply to the main engine before attempting to activate the vessel’s carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed fire suppression system remotely, which was without success. An attempt to locally activate the system also failed and resulted in the cylinder room flooding with CO2. However, due to the cessation of fuel flow, the engine stopped, and the fire extinguished itself soon after as the vessel was anchored north of Pelee Island, Ontario. TSB investigators established that the fire was caused by fuel spraying from a disconnected injection line onto exposed hot surfaces of the engine’s exhaust gas piping. It emerged that after an earlier repair, the retaining clamps were not reinstalled on the fuel injection lines, increasing the effects of engine vibration, something that made the lines susceptible to loosening. TSB terms it one of the many casual repairs that were undertaken on the aging bulker. Following the earlier engine repair, recurring minor leaks were addressed as routine maintenance without investigating the underlying cause. Although the practice deviated from the manufacturer's specifications, the crew was unaware as they lacked regular access to updated maintenance and torque specifications from the engine manufacturers. The investigation established that while vibration is inherent in all diesel engines due to various factors, the Cuyahoga’s main engine systems showed the effects of excessive engine vibration. To reduce the effects of vibration on the fuel injection line fittings, retaining clamps had been added to secure the fuel injection lines to the cylinder heads, making the lines more rigid and reducing mechanical vibration in the fuel injection lines. TSB writes in its report that Cuyahoga's fuel injection return line for cylinder 7 was disconnected, which resulted in a spray of marine diesel oil. They believe all the retaining clamps on the fuel injection lines were most likely removed in 2021 when the crew replaced the fuel supply and return manifolds. The CO2 fire suppression system failed due to several factors, reports TSB. The remote release cables had been routed through the engine room and were damaged by the fire, rendering them inoperative. When the crew attempted a manual release, TSB reports the system discharged CO2 into the cylinder room instead of the engine room, due to incorrect activation instructions and loose or missing components. Two days after the fire, the vessel was towed to Kingsville. No injuries or pollution were reported, but the bulker’s engine room and associated machinery sustained heat and smoke damage. The main engine and various electrical cables and equipment also sustained moderate to severe fire damage. Although the aged vessel returned to service following the incident, another fire broke out while she was docked in Ashtabula, southwest of Erie, Ohio, on Lake Erie, in March 2024. That fire occurred while the vessel was being prepared after winter layup, but it ended her long career. In July, Cuyahoga was towed into the IMS Docks for scrapping. TSB warns that the issues raised in this investigation, particularly around emergency procedures and the use and maintenance of fixed fire suppression systems, are not unique and affect the safety of marine transportation across Canada. The safety organization reports it started a more wide-reaching national safety issue investigation in July 2025 after having raised concerns about these issues for years. TSB says it is in the process of building a clearer understanding of how vessel fires are currently managed and identifying the gaps in Canada’s preparedness for marine emergencies.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
Malfunction on Research Vessel Falkor (too) Stops Uruguay's Expedition,https://maritime-executive.com/article/malfunction-on-research-vessel-falkor-too-stops-uruguay-s-expedition,,30/08/2025 02:10:39,,"A high-profile research expedition to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan sovereign waters has suffered a setback after the research vessel Falkor (too) suffered technical issues. The vessel was forced to return to port for repairs. The Universidad de la República (Udelar) announced that only days after embarking on August 22 for the much-publicized ‘Uruguay SUB 200’ expedition, the vessel was returning to the Port of Montevideo. The expedition had received the attention of President Yamandú Orsi. The ship, which is owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) and is highlighted as one of the most advanced research vessels, is said to have suffered issues with the main structure that is used to deploy and recover heavy underwater equipment. The A-frame structure malfunctioned as it was being raised from its stowed position to vertical, forcing a return to port for repairs. “It's with great sadness that we inform you that we're returning to port to fix some technical issues. We hope it's resolved soon and we can get back to exploring our ocean,” said the University in an alert. The vessel had departed for the mission to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan waters with a team of 37 scientists and technicians from 18 institutions in six countries. Dubbed ‘Uruguay SUB 200: Journey into the Unknown,’ the month-long expedition was aimed at studying marine ecology, underwater archaeology, deep-sea mapping, and marine geophysics, among others. The mission would have seen Falkor (too) sail about 200 to 300 kilometers off the Uruguayan coast to explore 50 points of interest on the seabed, from 200 to 3,500 meters deep. Of critical importance was the fact that the scientific team was expected to share the mission’s experience through live broadcasts from high-quality images taken on the seabed by the vessel’s suBastian remotely operated vehicle that is capable of reaching depths of 4,500 meters. Built in 2011 as the offshore industry vessel Polar Queen, SOI acquired Falkor (too) from Norwegian shipping company GC Rieber Shipping ASA. The 110-meter vessel was refitted to become a state-of-the-art mobile research facility with modern laboratories, tools, equipment, and a high-performance computing system for ocean exploration and study. The vessel has an endurance of 60 to 120 days. The name was chosen to continue the tradition of an earlier vessel. The original Falkor was donated to Italy’s science agency National Research Council (CNR), in 2022. Earlier this month, Falkor (too) completed a three-week Argentinian-led expedition that studied the Mar del Plata Canyon, one of the country’s largest underwater canyons that is located 300 kilometers offshore. Early this year, the Class C polar certified vessel also completed its first science expedition to Antarctica.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
Arrest Warrant Issued After Captain Skips Hearing on Intoxication Charge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/arrest-warrant-issued-after-captain-skips-hearing-on-intoxication-charge,,30/08/2025 01:42:19,,"The containership captain, who was arrested on charges that he was operating his vessel while intoxicated, failed to show for a court hearing this week. The King County District Court in Washington State issued a $10,000 warrant for his arrest on August 27 after both the captain and his lawyer did not attend a scheduled pre-trial hearing. Oleh Danylin, age 48 and a Ukrainian citizen, was charged on August 25 with operating the vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX (108,770 dwt / 8,800 TEU), while intoxicated after having been reported by a Puget Sound pilot. The first officer of the containership had assumed command of the vessel and, along with the pilot, navigated the ship from the anchorage in Everett, Washington, to the berth in Seattle. The ship was detained until MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company supplied a replacement captain. The court had ordered Danylin to remain in the state, not to consume alcohol, and that his passport should be in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard. Court papers from when he was charged reflect that he was requesting an interpreter, but pleaded not guilty to the charge. A U.S. Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service had boarded the ship, and according to court papers, the captain agreed to a sobriety test. Court papers said he was performing so poorly, the investigators stopped the test for his own safety. He later told investigators that he had not consumed alcohol in two months. He said the smell the pilot reported was “likely mouthwash” he used 10 minutes prior. However, he had agreed to the sobriety test and then a chemical breath test given by the Coast Guard, which showed 0.24 percent blood alcohol. He took two additional breath tests administered that same afternoon by the Washington State Patrol, and both registered 0.25 percent blood alcohol content. The Coast Guard imposed $1,000 civil penalty, and Danylin was charged and appeared before the judge on August 25. The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to attend a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
USCG Lifts Hatch Cover as It Investigates Baltimore Bulker Explosion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-lifts-hatch-cover-as-it-investigates-baltimore-bulker-explosion,,30/08/2025 00:21:35,,"The hatch cover that was blown overboard during the explosion on the bulker W-Sapphire was retrieved from the Baltimore shipping channel on Thursday, August 28. It is part of the ongoing investigation into the incident 10 days ago, on August 18, shortly after the vessel departed the coal terminal in Baltimore. The Fort McHenry Federal Channel leading into and out of the Port of Baltimore was closed to vessel traffic on Thursday from 0730 to 1500 local time. A 500-yard safety zone radius was established around the location of the hatch cover at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay. Dive and salvage operations were undertaken. By mid-afternoon, the USCG posted that the 30-ton hatch had been successfully retrieved from the Patapsco River. The safety zone restriction was removed and the channel reopened. Army Corps surveying the harbor area after the explosion (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore District had assisted the USCG and deployed its survey vessel Buck to conduct sonar surveys around Baltimore's Fort McHenry Channel on August 19, the day after the explosion. Captain Jake Tuer, who conducted the survey, reported that the data collected during this process would help determine the operational plan moving forward, including reopening the channel that day and yesterday’s recovery. The 751-foot bulker W-Sapphire remains anchored in the channel near Sandy Point State Park and north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The ship had been escorted into the anchorage shortly after the explosion and will remain there while the USCG and state authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion. Initial radio calls from the vessel said there was possibly water intake into the hold, but the force of the explosion appears to have mostly been driven upward, breaking through the hatch cover. Bulker being escorted out of the channel after the explosion on August 18 (North Point - Edgemere Volunteer Fire Department) Investigators are looking into the cause of the explosion, which ripped the hatch cover off the vessel’s number 2 hold. One leaf remained on deck while the other went overboard. There was a massive fireball, which observers said went several hundred feet into the air, followed by a smoke plume. Coal dust explosions are typically a secondary result of another trigger and require a mix of fuel, heat, and oxygen with the dust suspended in the air. They are reported to be considering spontaneous combustion as well as an external source of heat or fire that contributed to the explosion.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
"Israel Responds to Turkish Trade Ban, Moves Tugboat Order to Bulgaria",https://maritime-executive.com/article/israel-responds-to-turkish-trade-ban-moves-tugboat-order-to-bulgaria,,29/08/2025 22:49:16,,"The Israel Ports Company, which oversees the operations of the country’s ports, along with the Ministry of Transport, is reporting that they have moved an order for two advanced technology tugboats to a shipyard in Bulgaria in response to the actions of the Turkish government. According to the reports, the order was valued at $30 million and had previously been with an unnamed Turkish shipbuilder. News of the change came as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed in a speech to parliament today, August 29, the country’s new actions against Israel. As has been reported, Turkey is banning Israeli ships from its ports, ships transporting military cargo for Israel, and also, according to the minister, has closed its airspace. Turkish ships are also prohibited from calling at Israeli ports, expanding on a trade ban the government imposed last year. “Our decision to replace the Turkish shipyard with a friendly shipyard in Bulgaria is an expression of a clear policy,” said Miri Regev of the Minister of Transportation and Road Safety, according to a report in the Israeli news outlet Haipo. “We will not give in to boycotts, but will continue to ensure the strengthening of the ports, the continuity of service, and the independence of the State of Israel's operations.” The Haifa Maritime Transport Company signed the new contract with Bulgaria’s MTG Dolphin shipyard in Varna, Bulgaria. They will build two tugs to be delivered to the port by the end of 2026. ""The new tugboats are an integral part of our preparations for the coming years,” said Moshe Ben Zaken, Director General of the Ministry of Transportation. “We are working determinedly to provide Israel's ports with the most advanced technological tools to deal with the constant increase in the volume of maritime traffic."" The new tugs will be the most powerful yet deployed in Israel, with a pulling capacity of 85 tons. They will use Rotor tug technology. The plan calls for the new vessels to replace two of the four tugs currently operating in the Haifa port. Israel in April acquired for approximately $14.6 million a tug named Almog. The VECTOR model tug has a pulling capacity of 73 tons and is currently the most powerful in the country. It was deployed to the port of Ashdod and operates in the southern part of the country. Turkey has historically been a strong trading partner with Israel. It was exporting building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment to Israel. The Bank of Israel reported more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 embargo, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
DOT and MARAD Pull Nearly $700M in Port and Wind Terminal Grants,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dot-and-marad-pull-nearly-700m-in-port-and-wind-terminal-grants,,29/08/2025 21:13:55,,"The efforts to detail the U.S. offshore wind power industry are continuing with the US Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) terminating and withdrawing nearly $700 million in grants made by the Biden administration for wind ports and terminals. In total, they identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections in discretionary grant programs to be canceled. The press statement references “doomed offshore wind projects,” saying the funding will be prioritized toward restoring America’s maritime dominance. They report that DOT and MARAD are refocusing on “rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources.” DOT has withdrawn one project from the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program, saving they report roughly $427 million. MARAD has withdrawn six projects, retracting $177 million, and terminated six projects in the Port Infrastructure Development Program, saving roughly $75 million. It totals $679 million in grants. “The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,"" said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit supporting offshore wind and ocean energy. ""Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries; however, by selectively limiting infrastructure investments and removing mandated agreements in energy and shipyards, the administration is stalling essential development that delivers on shared priorities of national security and energy dominance, and signals to the investment community the U.S. is not safe place for investment."" The largest project included in the list is California’s Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, which loses roughly $427 million in grants. The list also includes major wind projects including the Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts which was terminated at a saving of roughly $33.8 million, the Norfolk (Virginia) Offshore Wind Logistics Port ($39 million), Sparrows Point (Maryland) Steel Marshalling Port ($47 million), New Jersey’s Wind Port at Paulsboro ($20 million), Arthur Kill (New York) Terminal ($48 million) and the Redwood (California) Marine Terminal ($8.7 million). It also includes $10.5 million for the Bridgeport Port Authority (Connecticut) for the Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project. The Port of Davisville (Rhode Island) loses $11.25 million. The Lake Erie Renewable energy project ($11 million), Radio Island Rail Improvements (North Carolina) loses $1.7 million, and Portsmouth Marine Terminal (Virginia) loses $20 million. The statement says that, where possible, funding from these projects will be ""recompeted"" to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States. “Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” The accusations from Duffy and the Trump administration ignore the extensive investments made by the offshore wind industry into shipbuilding and the revitalization of ports such as Salem, Bridgeport, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. In 2023, President Joe Biden highlighted that companies had announced 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects as well as investments of nearly $3.5 billion across 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to strengthen the American offshore wind supply chain. The vessels ranged from the first Jones Act-compliant installation vessels to SOVs and crew transfer vessels. They were being built at shipyards ranging from Florida to Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Many of the projects went to smaller shipyards to build crew transfer vessels. Among the large projects were SOVs built by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana and Fincantieri Bay in Wisconsin.

Evolving Role for Ship Managers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/evolving-role-for-ship-managers,,30/08/2025 03:53:38,,"Ship management is often identified as a tool for smaller fleets or individual shipowners to run their ships and keep up with the majors. The leading ship managers, however, say the practice is evolving from technical skills to incorporate consulting and advising as the shipping business is confronted with new challenges ranging from geopolitical issues to emerging technologies, increasing regulations and a shortage of seafarers. The emergence of the ship management industry was driven by a basic desire to achieve cost efficiencies, often through scale, while also ensuring regulatory compliance - all to permit owners to focus on the commercial rather than technical aspects of operations. Historically, ship management was mostly used by owners with smaller portfolios who lacked in-house expertise and found value in outsourcing. ""It's been an industry driven by standardized solutions designed to streamline operations and costs,"" says Mark O'Neil, CEO of Columbia Group. The model was designed, however, for a more stable and predictable era, when owners could rely on internal resources and conventional advisory partnerships to navigate relatively stable markets and regulatory environments. Despite rapid growth and increasing demands on shipowners, ship management companies only handle about 20 percent of the global commercial fleet. The other 80 percent, notes Niraj Nanda, Chief Commercial Officer of Anglo-Eastern, which has been in the business for over 50 years, is managed in-house. Integrated Approach As ships have gotten bigger and economic pressures have increased, the scope of work for ship managers has changed. Today, it requires an integrated approach to ensure safety, efficiency and regulatory compliance, according to Lisa Holum, Managing Director of OSM Thome Singapore. Tracing its roots back to the 1963 founding of Thome in Singapore and formed by the 2023 merger with OSM Maritime Group, OSM Thome encompasses not only technical management but also crew, compliance, procurement and sustainability initiatives. ""The ship management industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from being a cost-based, task-oriented service to becoming a strategic value partner to shipowners,"" explains Ajay Chaudhry, Co-CEO – Ship Management, Synergy Marine Group. ""At Synergy, we believe the practice is being reshaped by three forces: regulatory pressure, technological maturity and rising expectations around crew wellbeing."" Emerging regulations around decarbonization and crew safety, for example, mean ship management is shifting from an operations focus to a value focus. The role of a ship manager is being fundamentally redefined with a shift towards risk mitigation, creating strategic advantages and providing access to specialized capabilities that owners cannot easily develop in-house. ""Owners give their vessels to a third-party manager so they can focus on their core competence of managing their vessels commercially while the manager specializes in operating ships efficiently and safely,"" says Ioannis Stefanou, Managing Director, Ship Management at Wallem Group. ""When we partner with an owner, we don't just manage their vessels. We also offer consultancy advice and added value services to take care of their very expensive assets."" The pressures on shipowners are driving many of the changes in the industry. ""Ship management is moving towards more of a global solution,"" says Captain Kuba Szymanski, General Secretary of InterManager, the only organization dedicated to representing the ship management industry. ""New requirements are making the role of a ship manager more like a business partner and not just a service provider."" Owners expect managers to deliver not only operational excellence but also guidance on decarbonization, digital solutions, regulatory compliance and crew challenges. ""We're moving beyond traditional ship management to offer a fully integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, energy and offshore services platform,"" highlights Columbia's O'Neil, noting that Columbia takes a holistic approach, combining digital tools, maritime HR, AI, sustainability and more. Ownership Changes Further driving change is a shift in the ownership profile of the shipping industry. In addition to the emergence of massive fleets, shipping has become more specialized with unique vessels for each segment and new types of owners. Capt. Szymanski of Inter- Manager notes ship managers already occupy the ""top end,"" serving LNG, LPG and tankers, but he sees the service ""now drifting toward"" bulk carriers and containerships. Other sectors, including ro-ros, passenger vessels and cruise ships, have also turned to outside managers, especially as they enter new markets. Ownership is moving from the traditional private families and legacy fleets to institutional investors, energy majors and first-time entrants who expect enterprise-grade governance, sustainability credentials and strategic alignment. ""We see a notable increase in leasing companies purchasing vessels, both newbuilds and resale tonnage, and then chartering them out on long-term or bareboat terms,"" says OSM Thome's Holum, who notes these new entrants rely on third-party managers. ""Many of these lessors are financial institutions without in-house technical management expertise."" The new owners include private equity firms and other non-maritime investors as well. Adds Anglo-Eastern's Nanda: ""These new stakeholders often lack operational expertise in ship management, creating opportunities for ship managers to provide end-to-end solutions."" Crew Scarcity Stricter environmental regulations, rapid technological advances, geopolitical instability and economic volatility have meant that managing a ship has never been more complex. However, the biggest challenge across all sectors of the industry may be crew scarcity and the related issues of aging seafarers and low participation rates from traditional sources of seafarers. The U.N.-led Maritime Just Transition Task Force recently highlighted that hundreds of thousands of seafarers must also be upskilled to prepare for the handling of methanol and then ammonia and hydrogen as future alternative fuels. The largest ship managers operate their own training centers, and some run pre-sea training programs. Anglo- Eastern, for example, has expanded its simulation-based training facilities with the leading engine companies - MAN Energy Solutions (now Everllence), WinGD and Wärtsilä - and launched the industry's first LNG/Ammonia bunkering station skid at its Maritime Institute in Mumbai, India. ""A ship is only as good as the crew we can place on it,"" says Sebastian von Hardenberg, CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. ""As we introduce future fuels to the maritime sector, safeguarding the crew and the vessels they operate through proper training must come first."" The company is taking proactive steps to close the skills gap, investing in training programs, simulation technology and collaborative forums. It established internal expert groups to design vessel-specific training modules covering everything from bunkering and emergency response to cargo handling protocols. In 2024, BSM launched its Smart Academy program to give undergraduate cadets training in a controlled and realistic work environment onshore and onboard, including training on a bridge simulator. Wallem has an in-house saying that ""The ships of the future will not be managed by the managers of the past."" It notes that new skills are required as digitalization spreads through shipping. ""The young generation of seafarers is tech savvy and computer skills come naturally to them,"" says Stefanou. Wallem has set up training for the use of methanol and ammonia and helped customers with wind-assisted propul- sion. With a focus on crew wellbeing, it conducted over 7,000 hours of training in 2024 and has a ""Mental Health Wellbeing Champion” onboard every ship. Anglo-Eastern's Nanda says, ""Attracting and retaining skilled seafarers remains a pressing issue, requiring innovative recruitment and training strategies."" In June, the company launched its Mission 30 initiative with the goal of increasing the proportion of management-level officers under the age of 30 from one percent to 30 percent by 2030. Next Challenges ""Owners increasingly need advisors who understand global complexity and can act as strategic partners, not just service providers,"" concludes Columbia's O'Neil. ""The next big challenges include talent retention, the mental health of seafarers, geopolitical instability and generational shifts in expectations. Ship managers must evolve from reactive support to proactive problem-solvers."" All the companies point to their efforts to develop specialized services and teams to address the emerging challenges. V. Group, for example, launched V.ERDE to address decarbonization while OSM Thome launched its green services division, EVIGO. Bernhard Schulte introduced LiveFleet, a single data source platform to monitor compliance with regulations, while Anglo-Eastern, through its newbuilding and project management divisions - Anglo-Eastern Technical Services (AETS) and SeaQuest - is expanding its involvement in future-fuel ship design. ""Beyond fuel and emissions, the next frontier of challenges lies in managing operational complexity, specifically around data governance, workforce transformation and asset lifecycle alignment,"" says Synergy's Chaudhry. ""Owners today are overwhelmed with compliance obligations, ESG disclosures and performance benchmarking, often across multiple jurisdictions and systems. The ship manager's role is no longer operational alone. It's increasingly strategic helping owners anticipate disruption, adapt with agility and remain competitive in a rapidly changing seascape."" Lifecycle Custodians Ship managers must now serve as ""lifecycle custodians,"" expanding their services to encompass broader challenges.

TSB: Fuel Leak Due to Casual Repair Caused Fire on Canada’s Oldest Laker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/tsb-fuel-leak-due-to-casual-repair-caused-fire-on-canada-s-oldest-laker,,30/08/2025 02:47:45,,"The fire that broke out in the engine room of Canada’s oldest vessel operating on the Great Lakes in 2023, the Cuyaoga, was a disaster waiting to happen, according to a new report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). The report cites a history of repeated fuel leaks and dangers that were often resolved with casual repairs on fuel injection pipes. Built in 1943 in Ohio by the American Ship Building Company, Cuyahoga was a historic bulk freighter launched as the J. Burton Ayers to transport iron ore during World War II. She was later converted into a self-unloading ship and was renamed Cuyahoga in 1995 by Lower Lakes Towing, part of Rand Logistics. Her original steam plant was finally converted to diesel in 2000, and she continued to maintain seasonal services on the Lakes transporting dry bulk commodities like coal, salt, grain, and crushed stone. On May 23, 2023, the Cuyahoga left Marblehead, Ohio, on a regular voyage bound for Kingsville. Three hours into the voyage, a fire ignited in the engine room, forcing the 20 crewmembers to initiate emergency responses. The 620-foot (189-meter) vessel was loaded with 11,400 metric tonnes of granular crushed stone. To avert a disaster, the crew responded by cutting the fuel supply to the main engine before attempting to activate the vessel’s carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed fire suppression system remotely, which was without success. An attempt to locally activate the system also failed and resulted in the cylinder room flooding with CO2. However, due to the cessation of fuel flow, the engine stopped, and the fire extinguished itself soon after as the vessel was anchored north of Pelee Island, Ontario. TSB investigators established that the fire was caused by fuel spraying from a disconnected injection line onto exposed hot surfaces of the engine’s exhaust gas piping. It emerged that after an earlier repair, the retaining clamps were not reinstalled on the fuel injection lines, increasing the effects of engine vibration, something that made the lines susceptible to loosening. TSB terms it one of the many casual repairs that were undertaken on the aging bulker. Following the earlier engine repair, recurring minor leaks were addressed as routine maintenance without investigating the underlying cause. Although the practice deviated from the manufacturer's specifications, the crew was unaware as they lacked regular access to updated maintenance and torque specifications from the engine manufacturers. The investigation established that while vibration is inherent in all diesel engines due to various factors, the Cuyahoga’s main engine systems showed the effects of excessive engine vibration. To reduce the effects of vibration on the fuel injection line fittings, retaining clamps had been added to secure the fuel injection lines to the cylinder heads, making the lines more rigid and reducing mechanical vibration in the fuel injection lines. TSB writes in its report that Cuyahoga's fuel injection return line for cylinder 7 was disconnected, which resulted in a spray of marine diesel oil. They believe all the retaining clamps on the fuel injection lines were most likely removed in 2021 when the crew replaced the fuel supply and return manifolds. The CO2 fire suppression system failed due to several factors, reports TSB. The remote release cables had been routed through the engine room and were damaged by the fire, rendering them inoperative. When the crew attempted a manual release, TSB reports the system discharged CO2 into the cylinder room instead of the engine room, due to incorrect activation instructions and loose or missing components. Two days after the fire, the vessel was towed to Kingsville. No injuries or pollution were reported, but the bulker’s engine room and associated machinery sustained heat and smoke damage. The main engine and various electrical cables and equipment also sustained moderate to severe fire damage. Although the aged vessel returned to service following the incident, another fire broke out while she was docked in Ashtabula, southwest of Erie, Ohio, on Lake Erie, in March 2024. That fire occurred while the vessel was being prepared after winter layup, but it ended her long career. In July, Cuyahoga was towed into the IMS Docks for scrapping. TSB warns that the issues raised in this investigation, particularly around emergency procedures and the use and maintenance of fixed fire suppression systems, are not unique and affect the safety of marine transportation across Canada. The safety organization reports it started a more wide-reaching national safety issue investigation in July 2025 after having raised concerns about these issues for years. TSB says it is in the process of building a clearer understanding of how vessel fires are currently managed and identifying the gaps in Canada’s preparedness for marine emergencies.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Malfunction on Research Vessel Falkor (too) Stops Uruguay's Expedition,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/malfunction-on-research-vessel-falkor-too-stops-uruguay-s-expedition,,30/08/2025 02:10:39,,"A high-profile research expedition to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan sovereign waters has suffered a setback after the research vessel Falkor (too) suffered technical issues. The vessel was forced to return to port for repairs. The Universidad de la República (Udelar) announced that only days after embarking on August 22 for the much-publicized ‘Uruguay SUB 200’ expedition, the vessel was returning to the Port of Montevideo. The expedition had received the attention of President Yamandú Orsi. The ship, which is owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) and is highlighted as one of the most advanced research vessels, is said to have suffered issues with the main structure that is used to deploy and recover heavy underwater equipment. The A-frame structure malfunctioned as it was being raised from its stowed position to vertical, forcing a return to port for repairs. “It's with great sadness that we inform you that we're returning to port to fix some technical issues. We hope it's resolved soon and we can get back to exploring our ocean,” said the University in an alert. The vessel had departed for the mission to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan waters with a team of 37 scientists and technicians from 18 institutions in six countries. Dubbed ‘Uruguay SUB 200: Journey into the Unknown,’ the month-long expedition was aimed at studying marine ecology, underwater archaeology, deep-sea mapping, and marine geophysics, among others. The mission would have seen Falkor (too) sail about 200 to 300 kilometers off the Uruguayan coast to explore 50 points of interest on the seabed, from 200 to 3,500 meters deep. Of critical importance was the fact that the scientific team was expected to share the mission’s experience through live broadcasts from high-quality images taken on the seabed by the vessel’s suBastian remotely operated vehicle that is capable of reaching depths of 4,500 meters. Built in 2011 as the offshore industry vessel Polar Queen, SOI acquired Falkor (too) from Norwegian shipping company GC Rieber Shipping ASA. The 110-meter vessel was refitted to become a state-of-the-art mobile research facility with modern laboratories, tools, equipment, and a high-performance computing system for ocean exploration and study. The vessel has an endurance of 60 to 120 days. The name was chosen to continue the tradition of an earlier vessel. The original Falkor was donated to Italy’s science agency National Research Council (CNR), in 2022. Earlier this month, Falkor (too) completed a three-week Argentinian-led expedition that studied the Mar del Plata Canyon, one of the country’s largest underwater canyons that is located 300 kilometers offshore. Early this year, the Class C polar certified vessel also completed its first science expedition to Antarctica.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Arrest Warrant Issued After Captain Skips Hearing on Intoxication Charge,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/arrest-warrant-issued-after-captain-skips-hearing-on-intoxication-charge,,30/08/2025 01:42:19,,"The containership captain, who was arrested on charges that he was operating his vessel while intoxicated, failed to show for a court hearing this week. The King County District Court in Washington State issued a $10,000 warrant for his arrest on August 27 after both the captain and his lawyer did not attend a scheduled pre-trial hearing. Oleh Danylin, age 48 and a Ukrainian citizen, was charged on August 25 with operating the vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX (108,770 dwt / 8,800 TEU), while intoxicated after having been reported by a Puget Sound pilot. The first officer of the containership had assumed command of the vessel and, along with the pilot, navigated the ship from the anchorage in Everett, Washington, to the berth in Seattle. The ship was detained until MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company supplied a replacement captain. The court had ordered Danylin to remain in the state, not to consume alcohol, and that his passport should be in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard. Court papers from when he was charged reflect that he was requesting an interpreter, but pleaded not guilty to the charge. A U.S. Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service had boarded the ship, and according to court papers, the captain agreed to a sobriety test. Court papers said he was performing so poorly, the investigators stopped the test for his own safety. He later told investigators that he had not consumed alcohol in two months. He said the smell the pilot reported was “likely mouthwash” he used 10 minutes prior. However, he had agreed to the sobriety test and then a chemical breath test given by the Coast Guard, which showed 0.24 percent blood alcohol. He took two additional breath tests administered that same afternoon by the Washington State Patrol, and both registered 0.25 percent blood alcohol content. The Coast Guard imposed $1,000 civil penalty, and Danylin was charged and appeared before the judge on August 25. The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to attend a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
USCG Lifts Hatch Cover as It Investigates Baltimore Bulker Explosion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-lifts-hatch-cover-as-it-investigates-baltimore-bulker-explosion,,30/08/2025 00:21:35,,"The hatch cover that was blown overboard during the explosion on the bulker W-Sapphire was retrieved from the Baltimore shipping channel on Thursday, August 28. It is part of the ongoing investigation into the incident 10 days ago, on August 18, shortly after the vessel departed the coal terminal in Baltimore. The Fort McHenry Federal Channel leading into and out of the Port of Baltimore was closed to vessel traffic on Thursday from 0730 to 1500 local time. A 500-yard safety zone radius was established around the location of the hatch cover at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay. Dive and salvage operations were undertaken. By mid-afternoon, the USCG posted that the 30-ton hatch had been successfully retrieved from the Patapsco River. The safety zone restriction was removed and the channel reopened. Army Corps surveying the harbor area after the explosion (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore District had assisted the USCG and deployed its survey vessel Buck to conduct sonar surveys around Baltimore's Fort McHenry Channel on August 19, the day after the explosion. Captain Jake Tuer, who conducted the survey, reported that the data collected during this process would help determine the operational plan moving forward, including reopening the channel that day and yesterday’s recovery. The 751-foot bulker W-Sapphire remains anchored in the channel near Sandy Point State Park and north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The ship had been escorted into the anchorage shortly after the explosion and will remain there while the USCG and state authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion. Initial radio calls from the vessel said there was possibly water intake into the hold, but the force of the explosion appears to have mostly been driven upward, breaking through the hatch cover. Bulker being escorted out of the channel after the explosion on August 18 (North Point - Edgemere Volunteer Fire Department) Investigators are looking into the cause of the explosion, which ripped the hatch cover off the vessel’s number 2 hold. One leaf remained on deck while the other went overboard. There was a massive fireball, which observers said went several hundred feet into the air, followed by a smoke plume. Coal dust explosions are typically a secondary result of another trigger and require a mix of fuel, heat, and oxygen with the dust suspended in the air. They are reported to be considering spontaneous combustion as well as an external source of heat or fire that contributed to the explosion.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
"Israel Responds to Turkish Trade Ban, Moves Tugboat Order to Bulgaria",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/israel-responds-to-turkish-trade-ban-moves-tugboat-order-to-bulgaria,,29/08/2025 22:49:16,,"The Israel Ports Company, which oversees the operations of the country’s ports, along with the Ministry of Transport, is reporting that they have moved an order for two advanced technology tugboats to a shipyard in Bulgaria in response to the actions of the Turkish government. According to the reports, the order was valued at $30 million and had previously been with an unnamed Turkish shipbuilder. News of the change came as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed in a speech to parliament today, August 29, the country’s new actions against Israel. As has been reported, Turkey is banning Israeli ships from its ports, ships transporting military cargo for Israel, and also, according to the minister, has closed its airspace. Turkish ships are also prohibited from calling at Israeli ports, expanding on a trade ban the government imposed last year. “Our decision to replace the Turkish shipyard with a friendly shipyard in Bulgaria is an expression of a clear policy,” said Miri Regev of the Minister of Transportation and Road Safety, according to a report in the Israeli news outlet Haipo. “We will not give in to boycotts, but will continue to ensure the strengthening of the ports, the continuity of service, and the independence of the State of Israel's operations.” The Haifa Maritime Transport Company signed the new contract with Bulgaria’s MTG Dolphin shipyard in Varna, Bulgaria. They will build two tugs to be delivered to the port by the end of 2026. ""The new tugboats are an integral part of our preparations for the coming years,” said Moshe Ben Zaken, Director General of the Ministry of Transportation. “We are working determinedly to provide Israel's ports with the most advanced technological tools to deal with the constant increase in the volume of maritime traffic."" The new tugs will be the most powerful yet deployed in Israel, with a pulling capacity of 85 tons. They will use Rotor tug technology. The plan calls for the new vessels to replace two of the four tugs currently operating in the Haifa port. Israel in April acquired for approximately $14.6 million a tug named Almog. The VECTOR model tug has a pulling capacity of 73 tons and is currently the most powerful in the country. It was deployed to the port of Ashdod and operates in the southern part of the country. Turkey has historically been a strong trading partner with Israel. It was exporting building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment to Israel. The Bank of Israel reported more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 embargo, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
DOT and MARAD Pull Nearly $700M in Port and Wind Terminal Grants,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dot-and-marad-pull-nearly-700m-in-port-and-wind-terminal-grants,,29/08/2025 21:13:55,,"The efforts to detail the U.S. offshore wind power industry are continuing with the US Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) terminating and withdrawing nearly $700 million in grants made by the Biden administration for wind ports and terminals. In total, they identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections in discretionary grant programs to be canceled. The press statement references “doomed offshore wind projects,” saying the funding will be prioritized toward restoring America’s maritime dominance. They report that DOT and MARAD are refocusing on “rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources.” DOT has withdrawn one project from the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program, saving they report roughly $427 million. MARAD has withdrawn six projects, retracting $177 million, and terminated six projects in the Port Infrastructure Development Program, saving roughly $75 million. It totals $679 million in grants. “The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,"" said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit supporting offshore wind and ocean energy. ""Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries; however, by selectively limiting infrastructure investments and removing mandated agreements in energy and shipyards, the administration is stalling essential development that delivers on shared priorities of national security and energy dominance, and signals to the investment community the U.S. is not safe place for investment."" The largest project included in the list is California’s Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, which loses roughly $427 million in grants. The list also includes major wind projects including the Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts which was terminated at a saving of roughly $33.8 million, the Norfolk (Virginia) Offshore Wind Logistics Port ($39 million), Sparrows Point (Maryland) Steel Marshalling Port ($47 million), New Jersey’s Wind Port at Paulsboro ($20 million), Arthur Kill (New York) Terminal ($48 million) and the Redwood (California) Marine Terminal ($8.7 million). It also includes $10.5 million for the Bridgeport Port Authority (Connecticut) for the Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project. The Port of Davisville (Rhode Island) loses $11.25 million. The Lake Erie Renewable energy project ($11 million), Radio Island Rail Improvements (North Carolina) loses $1.7 million, and Portsmouth Marine Terminal (Virginia) loses $20 million. The statement says that, where possible, funding from these projects will be ""recompeted"" to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States. “Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” The accusations from Duffy and the Trump administration ignore the extensive investments made by the offshore wind industry into shipbuilding and the revitalization of ports such as Salem, Bridgeport, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. In 2023, President Joe Biden highlighted that companies had announced 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects as well as investments of nearly $3.5 billion across 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to strengthen the American offshore wind supply chain. The vessels ranged from the first Jones Act-compliant installation vessels to SOVs and crew transfer vessels. They were being built at shipyards ranging from Florida to Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Many of the projects went to smaller shipyards to build crew transfer vessels. Among the large projects were SOVs built by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana and Fincantieri Bay in Wisconsin. Seatrium AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas, is completing the massive turbine installation vessel Charybdis, the first of its kind in the United States, for Dominion, and Hanwha Philly Shipyard recently floated a rock installation vessel being built for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Pirates Scared Off from Tanker Attack by Approaching Patrol Boats,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pirates-scared-off-from-tanker-attack-by-approaching-togolese-patrol-boat,,29/08/2025 19:43:40,,"The suspected attack on a small chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in West Africa is over, with the crew reported to be safe and AIS signals showing the vessel underway. The incident took place approximately 60 nautical miles south of Lome, Togo, but details remain unclear. The joint French–British monitoring operation Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) records the incident as concluded and lists it as a small vessel coming in close proximity to the tanker, which has been identified in other reports as the Endo Ponete (7,250 dwt) registered in Malta. Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel had been attacked and termed it an attempted boarding, while Ambrey called it a boarding incident. The vessel was getting underway from Togo and southbound for the Democratic Republic of Congo when the small boat approached. Vanguard reports the captain ordered the crew to muster and enter the citadel, and they notified the local authorities. A Togolese patrol boat was dispatched, and according to the reports, the pirates fled when they saw the approaching naval support. In addition, the Nigerian Maritime Administration (NIMASA) and the Nigerian Navy were also coordinating and dispatched an additional boat to assist the tanker. The tanker was searched, and the crew was released from the citadel. There are no reports of damage, but it is unclear if the vessel was boarded. Built in 2010, the tanker, which is 95 meters (312 feet) in length, is reported to have been operating in the region since being acquired by Endo Tankers in June 2023. It previously operated as the Mandume, registered in the Marshall Islands. Product tankers have emerged as a favored target of the pirates in the region. In April, a product tanker was boarded and robbed while off the Nigerian coast, and in the past, product tankers have been robbed of fuel in the region near Cote d’Ivoire. In March, a product tanker was robbed and crewmembers kidnapped further south off the Central African coast. MDAT-GoG reports this is the first incident in the region in at least 90 days. It reported a rash of incidents in the March and April timeframe, but overall, serious crime against merchant ships has been dramatically reduced after peaking in 2020 in the Gulf of Guinea region.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02

"UK, France and Germany Trigger UN ""Snapback"" Sanctions on Iran",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-france-and-germany-trigger-un-snapback-sanctions-on-iran,,29/08/2025 06:00:05,,"The UK, Germany and France have followed in the footsteps of U.S. regulators and have reimposed ""snapback"" sanctions on Iran over its nuclear weapons program. The decision amounts to an end of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the 2015 multilateral agreement that is known in the U.S. as the ""Iran nuclear deal."" The UN Security Council unanimously approved the JCPOA, and international monitors found that for the next three years, Iran appeared to keep to the letter of the deal on uranium enrichment and nuclear R&D. However, its other military activities continued unabated, creating an ongoing and urgent concern for Iran's critics and neighbors. Though not nuclear per se, these activities - specifically Iran's accumulating missile stockpile, its involvement in civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and its provision of training and support for anti-American militias - had serious strategic implications. In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions on Iran, initiating a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran's economically-vital petroleum sector. One year later, Iran began breaching the terms of the agreement on enriched uranium and centrifuges, and it restricted international monitors' access to its nuclear sites. The UK, France and Germany tried to mediate, but did not immediately exit the deal. ""We acted in good faith to preserve the JCPoA, in the sincere hope of finding a way to resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue, while preserving the agreement and remaining within its framework,"" the three European nations (together, the E3) said in a joint statement. In July 2025, in a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, the E3 proposed to extend its terms if Iran would meet several criteria, beginning with inspections and resumption of negotiations. Iran did not agree, and the E3 concluded that ""Iran's non-compliance with the JCPoA is clear and deliberate."" The E3 have decided to notify the UN Security Council that Iran is not following its commitments under the deal, activating the ""snapback"" mechanism that reimposes UN sanctions. ""If the UNSC does not adopt within 30 days a resolution to continue the lifting of UNSC resolutions on Iran, six Security Council resolutions, including on sanctions, will be restored,"" the E3 noted. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the announcement and said that it was a prelude to renewed negotiations. In a statement, Rubio said that ""snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it."" The UN sanctions that are set to enter into renewed effect will reimpose an arms embargo, an overseas asset freeze, a travel ban, limits on ballistic missile programs, and restrictions on nuclear technology. These limits could reinforce the economic effects of the U.S. government's unilateral ""maximum pressure"" sanctions regime. Iran's currency, the rial, fell abruptly after the E3's announcement, reflecting market expectations of additional economic pressure. In a statement Thursday, the Iranian government called the E3's actions a ""provocative and unnecessary escalation,"" and pledged to respond. ""Iran has acted responsibly and in good faith in adhering to diplomacy for resolving nuclear-related issues,"" asserted Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a statement. The current status of its nuclear program is opaque, as UN experts have been banned from its sites, and Iran denies that it has intentions of producing a nuclear bomb. But as of May - before a series of Israeli and American airstrikes - it was believed to possess enough high-enriched uranium to produce nine nuclear weapons. To achieve a nuclear breakout, Iran would still need to develop a working weapon design, and would have to process its uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal for fabrication.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Nord Stream Suspect Also Under Investigation for Tanker Attack in Italy,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nord-stream-suspect-also-under-investigation-for-tanker-attack-in-italy,,29/08/2025 04:14:25,,"The Ukrainian military veteran arrested last week in connection with the Nord Stream pipeline attack is also under investigation for involvement in the blast that hit the tanker Seajewel, according to Italian media reports. Serhii Kuzientsov, an ex-Ukrainian special forces soldier, was detained in the Italian resort town of Rimini last week by the Carabinieri. He has an outstanding warrant in Germany for involvement in the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream pipeline system, which badly damaged three out of the four Russian gas lines under the Baltic. According to Corriere della Sera, Kuzientsov had driven to Rimini in a car with Ukrainian plates, accompanied by his family, and had registered for lodging under his own name - hardly attempting to evade detection. Kuzientsov faces extradition to Germany to stand trial for charges related to the Nord Stream attack, and he is fighting that process in court. At a hearing on Monday, he told the Bologna Court of Appeal that he was in Ukraine at the time of the Nord Stream attack, and denied any knowledge of it. He is in detention while the legal process moves forward, according to Corriere de Bologna - but there is a possibility that he could also be charged in Italy for a separate incident. Prosecutors in Genoa have been conducting a terrorism investigation in connection with the attack on a crude oil tanker at Savona in February, and have previously told local media that they suspect a Ukrainian nexus. The vessel, Seajewel, is one of seven tankers that were hit by mysterious explosions in the first half of the year. All previously carried Russian cargoes, prompting speculation over possible Ukrainian involvement; Ukraine has invested significant resources in attacking the Russian energy industry, which is the financial foundation of the ongoing invasion. The Genoa investigation is looking into Kuzientsov's potential involvement in the attack on the Seajewel, according to Corriere della Sera. That inquiry is ongoing, and could lead to additional charges of wrecking a vessel with an aggravating factor of terrorist intent. Other arrests could be coming: German authorities have identified five more suspected accomplices in connection with the Nord Stream attacks, and have filed at least one other outstanding warrant.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02

Damen Launches latest Island Class for BC Ferries,https://maritime-executive.com/article/damen-launches-latest-island-class-for-bc-ferries,,31/08/2025 04:03:58,,"[By: Damen Shipyards] On 27 August, Damen Shipyards Group launched the latest Island Class ferry for Canada’s BC Ferries. The vessel is the second of four Island Class vessels currently under construction at Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania. Once operational, the ferries will provide low emission services connecting coastal communities along the coast of British Columbia. Forward steps When delivered, the ferry will be the eighth Island Class vessel that Damen has built for BC Ferries. The Island Class is based on the design of the Damen 8117 Electric Ferry (E3). The Galati shipyard has seen a lot of activity on all four Island Class vessels under construction over the past few weeks. In early July, the yard also marked the grand block assembly of the ninth vessel, and the keel laying of the tenth, on the same day. These ferries will transport passengers between Nanaimo and Gabriola Island, and Campbell River and Quadra Island. Damen is outfitting the vessels with diesel-electric hybrid propulsion. In the future, once the relevant electrical infrastructure is in place, BC Ferries intends to operate the ferries on 100% electric power. Long-term collaboration Damen Executive Director Global Sales Leo Postma said, “There’s been a lot of movement on the various Island Class vessels over the past few months and it’s very exciting for our team to see progress unfolding at such a rate. We continue to enjoy an excellent cooperation with BC Ferries. We are very grateful for the quality of this relationship, which is undoubtedly a significant factor in the ongoing success of the project.” Damen is also supplying BC Ferries with onshore charging equipment and will, via its BC-based Service Hub, continue to provide its client with support during the vessels’ operational phase. A new generation In a further step forward for sustainable public transport operations, the four Island Class vessels currently undergoing construction are being modified to reduce underwater radiated noise. Together, Damen and BC Ferries undertook a series of underwater noise measurements on the Island Class vessels already in operation. Damen, working with its suppliers, has put the findings from these measurements into reducing underwater radiated noise in this next generation of Island Class vessels. This is in line with BC Ferries’ Long Term Underwater Management Plan. The company has developed this Management Plan minimise impacts on marine life in the areas in which it operates, most notably the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale. Measures taken include hull drag reduction via towing tank testing after a number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Additionally, the adaptations were made to the vessels’ propulsion system including a new quieter and more efficient propeller blade design.

""It is more important today than any time in our history that we have the capacity and skills to not only be competitive with other countries, but to far exceed them,” said Senator Jack Reed (RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Reed called on the defense industry leaders in attendance to continue to advance American innovation and security. “What you do ultimately ensures the safety and security of our men and women in uniform across the world. This is a common purpose we share.” Distinguished speakers at the 11th annual sold-out event represented decades of experience across Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and private sector service, including RDML Peter Small, Chief Engineer and Commander of NAVSEA Warfare Centers; Dr. Andrew Erickson, Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute; Dr. Michael Winter, Chief Scientist, RTX; COL David Brown (ret.), Naval War College Center for Irregular Warfare and Armed Groups; LtGen Eric E. Austin, Deputy Commander, Combat Development and Integration, US Marine Corps Combat Development Command, and BG Chris Hackler, Deputy Commanding General, US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. Panels included “Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet” and “Mastering the Depths: Navigating the Engineering Battlespace.” Key takeaways from this year’s event are: “More than a decade after we hosted the first Defense Innovation Days, SENEDIA continues to see the critical need to bring together industry and government, civilian and military leaders to connect, collaborate with one another, and ultimately innovate in service of our national security,” said Molly Donohue Magee, Chief Executive Officer of SENEDIA. “Investing in defense is an economic, workforce, and national security imperative.” More from Defense Innovation Days An Increasingly Challenging and Complex Environment Rapid advancements in technology have made internal research and development processes more challenging and increased external and geopolitical pressures have likewise made the warfighting landscape more complex. A rise in authoritarianism around the globe represents a threat to American democracy – including from China. Returning to Defense Innovation Days, Dr. Erickson provided a deep dive into changes in the Chinese military. He said that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has removed large numbers of military, defense, and political officials, but warned that it does not signal a slowdown. To the contrary, Erickson called it “the most dramatic military build-up since World War II.” “China’s military capabilities development and operational readiness are clearly advancing rapidly across the board,” he said. “The speed and scope are breathtaking. That is what needs to inform our dedication, our sense of purpose, and the missions to which we are directed.” Several speakers noted the importance of the workforce to maintain American dominance. “The Navy faces an urgent imperative to increase our capabilities, and our people are our biggest asset,” said RDML Small. “It's not just the trades we need to strengthen. We need to rebuild the national maritime engineering workforce. A tremendous national effort to rebuild this workforce is underway.” The Unmanned and Undersea Advantage The United States submarine program is widely viewed as the greatest deterrent to American adversaries, and two panel discussions focused on undersea challenges and opportunities in an ever-changing maritime landscape. Several speakers used the ongoing conflict in the Black Sea as an illustration of how maritime strategy is changing, where Ukraine has used naval drones to stave off a strong Russian Navy. The Mastering the Depths panel was moderated by Marie Bussiere, the Technical Director of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport. She was joined on the stage by NUWC colleagues Mark Vacarro, Director of the Subsea and Seabed Warfare SSTM; Steve Plunkett, Next Generation Weapons and Defensive Systems SSTM; Steve Lamb, Chief of the Contracting Office, and CDR Shawn Stelzel of the Undersea Warfighting Development Center. Collectively, they urged industry leaders – especially those who have yet to engage with NUWC – to consider delivering their best-in-class tools and technology for defense applications. “To maintain the undersea advantage, we need to get solutions into the hands of the fleet faster,” Bussiere said. On the Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet panel, CAPT Colin Corridan (ret.), the former leader of Task Force 59, the Navy’s first maritime robotics and AI task force, moderated a panel that included Commander David Brannighan, Royal Navy, British Defence Staff USA, and Austin Gray, Co-Founder and CSO, Blue Water Autonomy. One takeaway of the panel included a charge to industry to apply their solutions to national security and help ensure a high-low procurement strategy that is diversified between advanced yet expensive high-end systems and cheaper, more flexible low-end systems. Moving at the Speed of Technology Across all three days, multiple speakers talked about the need to move faster – from harnessing AI and new technology to developing and quickly scaling new capabilities – to ensure our warfighters have the systems and tools they need when they need them. Just as undersea technology has changed the maritime landscape, COL Brown (ret.) pointed to drones as a comparable example of how airpower has been democratized. Beyond weapons, he also warned about disinformation as a weapon of war and how increasingly convincing deepfakes are making it difficult for military leaders and civilians alike to distinguish the truth. “We are entering an era of breathtaking technological advancement,” he said. “The warning of history is clear: Unless we adapt, the upheavals of the last century may pale in comparison to what lies ahead.” LtGen Austin and BG Hackler agreed on the importance of government and industry collaboration. Speed to execution must consider future changes in technology. Dr. Winter shared that RTX has introduced a new military engine nearly every decade over the last century. Looking forward, RTX and other Primes – as well as the supply chain companies that support them – must bring together the digital thread, relying on model-based systems engineering that allows for greater efficiency and responsiveness. “It is critical that we build these tools with enough longevity and enough forethought,” he said.

Bringing Command and Accountability Back to Surface Fleet Maintenance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bringing-command-and-accountability-back-to-surface-fleet-maintenance,,01/09/2025 03:40:34,,"There are times when “the way things are” are no longer acceptable. Radical change, with incremental and careful execution, is urgently needed within the US Navy’s Surface Ship Repair Maintenance enterprise to rectify the shortcomings of two decades of well-intentioned initiatives that rendered a majority of Surface ships neglected and ill-equipped for combat. The problem is not wholly maintenance related – the contributing issues came about as an aggregate result of the Navy’s increased operational tempo since the start of the Global War on Terror, changes in Surface Force manning models, and disputes with Congress over the decommissioning of certain classes of ships, among other things. Recent operations in the Red Sea today are eerily reminiscent of the world in 2002 when we stretched the Navy thin to answer the nation’s call – and paid a price for decades. A recent GAO report highlighted the impact of manning shortages to ship crew’s ability to perform corrective maintenance; over 75 percent of Executive Officers stated that it was “difficult or very difficult” to complete required corrective maintenance. To address the lack of sustained success, and avoid the missteps of the past, the Surface Force and NAVSEA should employ a multi-tiered approach primarily centered on retaking control of shipboard maintenance to get us fair in the channel again. 2002-2010: MSMO and Management Failure The story begins with the war in the Middle East in 2003. For the first time in decades, the Navy’s answer to the nation’s call to action, pushed the fleet forward, and kept it there, using its Tomahawks and Marines to enable an immensely successful land campaign. It was not by coincidence that the president chose an aircraft carrier as a platform to announce “Mission Accomplished.” The cost of that prolonged surge, however, was the deferral of a mountain of maintenance that had been scheduled for the ships and then canceled. The Navy needed to invent a way to get those ships back in service quickly and efficiently. Working with industry, the Navy developed a plan that would leverage the strengths of certain shipyards for certain types of maintenance and provide stability for the workforce by bundling multiple ships of the same class together with the idea that this would result in money savings and efficiencies in the process. This plan, called MSMO (Multi-Ship-Multi-Option) plan was implemented in the early 2000’s. As envisioned, this plan was a good idea, however naval officers know very little about the business world. There was an implicit assumption in the execution of the MSMO plan that the Navy would save money by encouraging the industry to voluntarily decrease their bottom line. Read that again. It was never going to happen, and it didn’t happen. As a contractor following my retirement, I learned that ship repair business is just that – a business. Right or wrong, income is predicated on the Navy spending money to fix ships – any significant efficiencies in that process result in less money spent, and thus less profit. Less profit makes stockholders unhappy and drives businesses out of business. At the same time, the Navy decided to save manpower dollars for other programs such as the Optimal Manning and Top Six Rolldown initiatives, which reduced shipboard manning and mandated the dissolution of the Ships Intermediate Maintenance Activities (SIMAs), which had been around since the early 1980s. In fact, the GAO reports that the backlog of incomplete maintenance exceeded any savings from manpower cuts that were instituted as part of Optimal Manning and other reductions in shipboard manning. The SIMA dissolution was especially problematic since SIMAs were primarily designed to be focused on two things: leveraging Sailors on shore duty to conduct relatively minor and mid-level repairs using the expertise gained at sea and training shipboard Sailors in their technical rating. The elimination of SIMAs had a second impact: it meant all work had to go to contractors at a much higher price. While it may be true that the cost of SIMA was higher than the projected cost of giving the work to private industry – SIMA was cheaper only if you did not consider the actual cost of SIMA, e.g. salaries, facilities, etc., the Sailor cost was already spent, and the training and experience of working on equipment in-rate on shore duty is difficult to put a price tag on. An additional phenomenon I observed was that the cadre of government planners who performed availability and maintenance planning and preparations were released and hired by contractors as this process moved to industry under the Multi Ship Multi Option (MSMO) strategy. This did not change the net number of personnel in this area, but it made the cost and scope of those with this skill set a bit more difficult to track and quantify, and may have added a cost to the process as well. In parallel, the Navy drastically reduced the footprint of an organization called Supervisor of Shipbuilding, who was basically the “overseer” designed to hold the ship builders and ship maintainers honest and uphold standards. Around this timeframe (roughly 2007-2010), another dynamic came and went: Ship Class Squadrons, or CLASSRONs. Modeled after the Naval Aviation Enterprise, these groups were formed around each ship class and were given control of maintenance funding, acquisition processes, and current readiness. Led by sequential major commanders with experience in a specific ship class, they consolidated processes, lessons learned, assessments, and maintenance under one individual – wearing a command pin. They also tracked Class Advisories and major modifications across a focused subset of ships. As a cruiser commanding officer, I (Cordle) was overwhelmingly satisfied with the support received by the class advocate. In my specific case, the Cruiser CLASSRON Commander had held my job before, and therefore understood it. The CLASSRON Commander had the time and bandwidth to deal with roughly 20 ships compared with the current model where one Engineering Duty Officer Captain has to process all of the maintenance information associated with over 100 ships on each coast. The CLASSRON initiative was not given enough “bake time” and would have likely produced significant dividends if left in place. This occurred in 2012 with the justification that it created a parallel C2 process and muddied the waters with respect to funding. In an effort to improve oversight, Commander Navy Regional Maintenance Center, (CNRMC), was established in 2010 to standardize and oversee the Regional Maintenance Centers, whose processes were perceived to have drifted over the years. The goal was to place a flag officer on the waterfront with the supporting staff to police the maintenance process. While initially successful, the center of gravity of that organization has shifted to Washington and away from the waterfront. And in another manning decision, the Navy combined two flag positions, one for ship maintenance and one for modernization, placing arguably the two most complex functions in the Navy enterprise on the shoulders of one junior Flag officer. From this author’s experience, this task is too great for one individual, no matter how Herculean his or her efforts could be – they will always be pulled in two directions – one toward, and one away from the waterfront. 2011-2014: The Trends Worsen In the early 2010s, the VADM Balisle report and subsequent GAO findings were released, indicating a dangerous trend of neglect within the Surface Force. As a result, the Navy looked to reverse course in Sailor maintenance, manpower/manning models, and Officer training – albeit this was a slow change. As an outcrop of these reports and the associated action items, the Navy implemented the Surface Engineering Maintenance Planning Project, SURFMEPP, designed to focus on life cycle maintenance, act as the “conscience of the Navy” to get ships to expected service life, which has been extended several times from 35 to 45 years over the same period. With 2013 entered sequestration, government shutdowns, and funding shortfalls across the enterprise. During my time (Cordle) on active duty, I sat at the front table of Naval Surface Forces Atlantic time and again and signed documents that cut significant lifecycle maintenance from Surface ship availabilities because the money was not available. To be sure, the confluence of these factors did make the MSMO more efficient, more flexible, and able to maximize the work completed, but it did not save money. The other unfortunate side effect was that a lack of rigor and uniformed oversight on the Navy side allowed companies to take advantage of the situation thereby increasing profits, although they arguably used much of the extra income to reinvest and try to grow, train, and pay their workforce in a standard capitalist model (that we laud in most other applications) – but with the Navy as their only paying customer. In the end, industry conducted themselves like any capitalist business that has to make money to stay viable. It is worth noting as background perhaps, but even before sequestration the lack of stability in the funding lines created considerable volatility in the repair community even under MSMO – the long-standing practice of underfunding surface ship maintenance and then using mid-year plus ups to close the gap to meet requirements generates its own uncertainty every fiscal year, as I experienced in my short tenure as a Type Commander Maintenance Officer in 2011 (Cordle). Thus, the MSMO financing vehicle coupled with the elimination of SIMAs, which was initially hailed as a process designed to get the most work done (albeit at a premium price), fell victim to economics, in that the expected savings never materialized. As a result, in the decade that was the 2005 to 2015, the Surface Navy gave away its ability to fix itself and took out title loans on its ships in the form of a maintenance backlog to the tune of billions of dollars. Add to this the compounding “interest” of fewer Sailors with less training conducting shipboard self-evaluation, and you get the expected result: a rather large volume of unaddressed maintenance discrepancies aboard ships. 2015-2020:Replacing MSMO with MACMO About halfway through this journey, in the 2010s after one or two complete change outs of the key leaders who brought MSMO to the table, a new narrative developed: civilian contractors are making too much money and keeping the ships longer to increase their bottom line. Unfortunately, rather than conduct a holistic self-analysis of the system, the Navy abruptly scrapped the MSMO concept in favor of a firm-fixed price, restrictive process that allowed a relatively small set of contractors to bid on large availabilities individually and called it another name bathed in obfuscation: the Multi Award Contract Multi Option, or MACMO, process. Designed to cure the ills of the MSMO process by driving competition and accountability into the system, this was another good idea, but as Admiral (ret) Jesse Wilson once said, “whenever you create a new process you create new problems”. Since this was a fairly classic “top down” initiative, there was not much of an appetite for pushback or critique and not much time to shift the processes to support it. Several established and complex processes were taken on by the government, including the purchasing of long lead time materials and the complex and detailed planning process, without a robust experience base or training program in place to support it. The learning curve for this change was a steep one, and the Navy paid a price in planning and material delays during the transition to this new process. A 2017 GAO report captured the precise cost of these manning decisions, in terms of unexecuted maintenance, in billions of dollars and millions of man-days. The graphs are eye-popping and relevant even today. Manpower Savings were more than offset by increased maintenance costs (Source: GAO) Now came some interesting system dynamics that while predicted, created a new set of issues when juxtaposed against the changes previously mentioned. First, the Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers (DDGs) and the Harpers Ferry-class Landing Ship, Dock ships (LSDs) entered their midlife periods, forcing maintenance availabilities to extend beyond the previous 3 to 5-month durations into durations of 12-18 months. This length change required more planning, more parts, and a larger, better trained workforce in industry, all of which were sub-optimized by the transition to MACMO. Secondly, the Navy also revived the Coast Wide Bid process that surprised many when it actually happened to USS RAMAGE and again to USS SHOUP a few years later. Navy Manpower and manning management processes in both the active duty and civilian side are not aligned to support such endeavors. Thirdly, Congress and the Navy treated the Cruisers and LSDs as chips in a game of poker, alternately placing them on decommissioning lists, cutting their funding to near zero, laying them up, and then trying to bring them back after a bluff has been called. This resulted in huge sunk costs, delays in critical repairs, not to mention the impact on manning and morale of crews that were “strung along” for years in a decommissioning mindset. Like trying to restore the old Ford truck that one would find in their grandfather’s pasture, this effort has grown in cost and magnitude far beyond original estimates, sucking money away from other endeavors. Delays in designing a replacement for these capital ships, which are pretty awesome warfighters, have resulted in their being kept around, with the quandary that no capital ship is as capable, nor as expensive to maintain, as our aged cruisers. 2020-Present: The Consequences A 2020 GAO report found that “since shifting to the Multiple Award Contract-Multi Order (MACMO) contracting approach for ship maintenance work in 2015, the Navy has increased competition opportunities, gained flexibility to ensure quality of work, and limited cost growth, but schedule delays persist. During this period, 21 of 41 ship maintenance periods, called availabilities, for major repair work cost less than initially estimated, and average cost growth across the 41 availabilities was 5 percent. Schedule outcomes were less positive, and Navy regional maintenance centers varied in their performance.2 This is shown in the graph below: Schedule delays under MAC-MO Contracting (Source: GAO) Admiral Galinis, who later commanded NAVSEA as a 3-star, when asked at a 2015 Fleet Maintenance Seminar what changes the MACMO would bring around, he said “two things we will lose are flexibility and teamwork.” In retrospect, he was correct. Unfortunately, they were lost at a time when they were much needed. Another ingredient added to this complex system of setbacks was the ramp up of operational employment based on growing threats in the Pacific and in the Arabian Gulf. This resulted in policies of maintenance deferral and reduced certification requirements, all well documented in the Comprehensive Review of 2017. Righting the Ship In a 2019 article, David Larter described Navy Maintenance as a “dumpster fire.” While we do not fully agree with this dark assessment, it is definitely in need of a good overhaul. Surface Navy leaders have taken some action to help put us in a good place, including: 1. Surface Type Commanders have established a Post-Major Command Surface Warfare O-6 billet to oversee all aspects of the maintenance domain. This brings experience, oversight, and seniority to the process and is starting to pay dividends. 2. Establishment of Surface Readiness Groups – this initiative (which is not new) theoretically restores the positive attributes found in CLASSRONs. Under the Surface Readiness Group model, all ships in the Maintenance Phase are aligned under one Commodore per homeport, allowing a singular focus on maintenance and freeing up the deployed Commodores to focus on warfighting. These are great steps to remedy the problems. Imagine if a Ford F-150 production line had to deal with a change to baseline of about 30 percent – this would be a flawed business model. Yet, this is what we ask the maintenance community to deal with every time a ship enters a yard period. To address this dilemma, the Surface Force needs to improve its scope of work planning for upcoming surface availabilities. Additionally, there should be more margin built into the schedule and price of each availability. Availabilities should start with a measure of float built in, and the Surface Force should resist the urge to plan against this float. Further, the Surface Force should acknowledge that there will be increases to scope and new work, instead of ignoring it or pretending it will not manifest. By leveraging options, frontloads, class maintenance plans, and flexible contracting, it must be possible to fund and plan for both long-term maintenance and current repairs. Things on a ship break all the time, and the process needs to be proactive vice reactive. Additionally, the Navy should consider the following measures: 1. Treat this like the crisis that it is. Assemble a team of the most experienced people and challenge them to come up with a plan but force them to take off their functional “armor” (acquisition, modernization, maintenance, contracting, etc.) to collaborate on a new plan that is innovative, integrated, and responsible. This team should be challenged to openly discuss the best and worst parts of each model from MSMO to MACMO, Firm Fixed Price and Cost-Plus contracts. The narrative that “the utterance of the word MSMO will result in career suicide” is not helpful here. 2. Restore SIMA as a separate command. SIMAs are currently resident within Code 900 at the Regional Maintenance Centers. This construct sub optimizes SIMA’s visibility, employment, and effectiveness. Command is command; and putting a Shore Command Pin on the Commander of Ship Intermediate Maintenance would open additional command opportunities to the Engineering Duty Officer community – and consequently be good for the ships and Sailors. 3. Empower the local shipyard. Currently a Shipyard Commander has relatively no tools or levers to punish or incentivize a lead maintenance activity during a Shipyard availability. For instance, if an LMA neglects to conduct a repair within a prescribed timeline, or the work is not completed to the level of quality that it should, the shipyard has to spend exorbitant amounts of time, resources, and money to present an iron-clad case to fiscally punish the LMA. In many cases, it is more cost effective to not pursue punishment. Conversely, the Shipyard Commander has little to no way of rewarding a LMA who does a job well (on time and/or under budget). Consideration should be given to allowing the Shipyard Commander, with delegation to pertinent Project Managers, to fiscally reward or withhold a relatively small percentage of money at their level. The shipyard represents the “tactical ground commander” and observes many violations in Shipboard maintenance, and has very little ability to affect immediate change. 4. Fix the planning phase of major availabilities. On average, the amount of work during a major availability changes by roughly 30 percent after it begins. This corresponds to a range of 2,000 and 20,000 Requests for Contract Changes (RCCs) depending on the length of the maintenance period. One solution is a “Business Model Cost and Schedule” approach that was published in the Naval Engineer’s Journal in 2021. 5. Revive the good parts of the MSMO strategy to include focusing certain repair yards on certain classes of ships and providing bundled ship contracts over a period of years to allow consistency, gain some efficiencies, and train a workforce for the nation’s future. This approach does not have to be unitary in its contracting strategy but could include a more flexible pricing process described in #1 above. The contracting officers will have issues with this, but we cannot continue to build the maintenance process around the contracting process instead of around the Fleet. Many in the commercial industry have shared that a predictable and dependable income stream are critical to allowing industry to train the workforce and invest in infrastructure. 6. Leverage the goodness of processes like the Continuous Intermediate Availability (CIA) model conducted in Rota, Spain, which is similar to the old 13-week availabilities, where TYCOM-level maintenance is accomplished in short, focused maintenance periods. This could be folded into the OFRP, perhaps at the beginning of the Sustainment Phase right after deployment, and the ship return to service for a while before starting maintenance. To be sure, this initiative will have to be balanced against the need of the Operational Commander. 7. Split the Flag Officer billets for maintenance and modernization. There isn’t a single root cause for many of the current issues, nor is the problem with any particular individual. However, the move to put too many decisions on a single individual’s plate was a singularly bad move and needs to be fixed quickly. 8. Move the commander of CNRMC to Norfolk, and place a deputy in San Diego. The vision of CNRMC that was put in place by USFF in 2010 was to place a Flag Officer on the waterfront overseeing ship’s maintenance. That fundamental tenet has been lost but could be regained relatively simply. The new modernization Flag Officer can satiate the appetite in Washington for information, while their maintenance counterpart can get “boots on the ground” and start extracting ships from the yards with a crowbar instead of a 300-mile towing hawser. Of note, a similar move was just implemented with the creation of a Flag Officer billet to supervise the nuclear shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia. 9. Replicate the Supervisor of Shipbuilding model from the nuclear side at the regional maintenance centers. Empower them to provide oversight, accountability, and rigor to the ship repair process. Put teeth back into the process. Rewrite the NAVSEA Standard Item 009-060 to require contractors to provide a detailed, integrated plan that can be graphed, tracked and used to hold them to account. If there is one thing I hear over and over from Commanding Officers in the yards, it is “who is holding anyone accountable?” You can figure out the answer. No one. 10. Bring back a deployable ship repair capability to replace the Yellowstone Class Destroyer Tenders by installing a full machine repair capability (including Additive Manufacturing) into one Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) class ship in each theater. These multi-purpose platforms have lots of space and could probably support a modular solution as well. Manning could be surged from the Regional Maintenance Centers in time of need. This is not an argument to completely revert to the old way of doing things. This article is formulated from not just our own experiences, but multiple peers who (at least to some extent) feel the same way. One shared, “Firm Fixed Price is a great model for the commercial industry or Maritime Sealift Command, for basic maintenance on ships that are not all that complex; it is exactly the wrong model for complex warships that require expertise, flexibility, and integration – like Navy ships.” There were many sins (including some in which at least one of us was complicit), all well intentioned, and many unavoidable over the years. But by scrapping programs that used to work, and failing to look for another solution, we will all simply admire the problem as more and more of the Fleet is tied to the pier when it is needed most. Instead, the Surface Warfare Community needs to take control of its own destiny, help the Engineering Duty Officer community do its core job, assume responsibility for the maintenance of its ships, increase command opportunity, and inject rigor, decisiveness, and accountability into a system where these words have gone out of style. One key component of any strategy is to “take a fix.” The 2022 GAO report on maintenance backlog provides a stunning insight into the lack of accuracy and estimating the value of deferred maintenance. The amount provided to the GAO was literally off by a factor of 10 ($1.8 billion vs $180 million). This gap was then addressed by accelerating decommissioning of multiple ships which collectively represented about 80% of the gap. Unfortunately this approach addresses the immediate problem without addressing the root cause; its effect will be temporary and cannot be repeated. As today’s Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Readiness Groups engage in global combat operations unparalleled in modern history, with even less ships than we had during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the same forces at work in 2002 are starting to become evident, with deployments stretching to an average of over 220 days and no end in sight. Unless something changes, we are likely to find ourselves in the same position 10 years from now. Captain John Cordle, USN, retired from the Navy in 2013 after 30 years of service. He commanded the USS Oscar Austin (DDG-79) and USS San Jacinto (CG-56), earning a Bronze Star in 2003 and the U.S. Navy League’s Captain John Paul Jones Award for Inspirational Leadership in 2010. He is a Plankowner on CVN 75 and CVN 77, where he served as Reactor Officer. He received the SNA Literary Award in 2014 and 2019, as well as the 2019 ASNE Solberg Award and U. S. Naval Institute Author of the Year Award for his contributions to fatigue management in the United States Navy. In addition to serving as Chief of Staff for Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (SURFLANT), he also served as a Program Manager for Maintenance University at Hunnington Ingalls Industries and as a GS 14 Human Factors Engineer at SURFLANT, where he was recognized with the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Now retired, he is focused on leveraging his life experience to help develop future leaders. Captain Holman Agard, USN, has a combined 27 years of service between the Enlisted and Officer ranks. He currently is serving as the Commanding Officer of USS SHOUP (DDG 86) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Commander for the GEORGE WASHINGTON Carrier Strike Group (CSG-5) based in Yokosuka, Japan. Previously, he served in OPNAV N96 as the Destroyers Branch Head and Ships Deputy. He also was the Executive Officer and Commanding Officer in USS HOPPER (DDG 70). He has experienced extensive maintenance availabilities in all six ships he has been stationed on.

Appeals Court Rules That Most of Trump's Tariffs are Unlawful,https://maritime-executive.com/article/appeals-court-rules-that-most-of-trump-s-tariffs-are-unlawful,,01/09/2025 03:10:29,,"A federal appeals court has affirmed the lower court ruling that invalidated the Trump administration's sweeping nation-by-nation ""retaliatory"" tariffs. The court found that the levies do not have a legal basis under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law that the administration has used to undergird most of its rapidly-shifting tariff announcements. IEEPA was enacted in 1977 to limit the president's power to impose punitive trade measures without Congress' involvement. The act allows the president to take certain trade actions during a declared emergency to respond to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to America's economy or national security. Powers enumerated under the act include blocking tranactions, freezing assets, and (in the event of an actual attack) confiscating property belonging to the threat. The statute limits each ""emergency"" to one year at a time, an attempt to curtail open-ended presidential decrees. It has been used by previous presidents on rare occasions, like sanctioning Al Qaeda, targeting the ayatollahs' regime in Iran, or limiting the finances of Colombian drug gangs. Trump used IEEPA extensively during his first term, and has begun to apply it in earnest since January 2025. Most of his administration's tariffs - including all of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. trading partners - rest on claims of authorities under IEEPA, but the administration has had difficulty defending these applications of the statute in court. In May, the Court of International Trade in New York found that Trump's retaliatory tariffs were not legally justified by IEEPA, but it stayed its decision pending appeal. The administration then took the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; on Friday, the court determined that IEEPA does not give the president any tariff powers (the word tariff does not appear in the text of the statute). Since Congress did not say that it would hand over its constitutional authority to levy tariffs when it wrote IEEPA, the court ruled, Congress did not delegate those powers to the president; though the White House does have other tariff authority under other statutes, the court found that it does not have tariff authority stemming from IEEPA. IEEPA ""neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs,"" the appeals court ruled. ""Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs."" The appeals court stayed its ruling to give time for an appeal to the Supreme Court, which is highly likely. The court has responded favorably on most the administration's requests for emergency stays, and Trump held out hope that it would pause or overrule this court decision as well. ""Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,"" President Trump wrote Friday in a social media post. ""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32
Pacific Island Nations are Divided Over Deep Sea Mining,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pacific-island-nations-are-divided-over-deep-sea-mining,,01/09/2025 00:34:59,,"[By Kolaia Raisele and Aidan Craney] In recent years, Pacific island nations have earned global credibility as champions of climate action. Pacific leaders view sea level rise as an existential threat. But this united front is now under strain as some Pacific nations pursue a controversial new industry – deep-sea mining. Nauru, the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Tonga have gone the furthest to make it a reality, attracted by new income streams. But nations such as Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining in international waters. Public opinion across the Pacific is often divided, pitting possible economic gains against the potential risks of an industry whose environmental impact remain uncertain but potentially significant. As this tension intensifies, it may split the Pacific and risk the region’s moral authority on climate. What are the concerns over deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining targets three types of mineral deposits – polymetallic nodules strewn across deep underwater plains, cobalt-rich crusts on seamounts, and the ore deposits around hydrothermal vents. To extract them, mining companies can use unmanned collectors to pump ore to the surface and return the wastewater. This creates plumes of sediment which can smother marine life. Methods of minimizing damage to species from mining on land are largely unworkable at depth. Deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood, but we know they are slow to recover. Researchers have found areas mined as a test more than 40 years ago still show physical damage and immobile corals and sponges remain scarce. Many species live on the seabeds, seamounts and hydrothermal vents which would be targeted for mining. Pictured: a crab crawling across a field of polymetallic nodules near Gosnold Seamount. NOAA, CC BY-NC-ND Why is there so much interest in deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining hasn’t begun anywhere in earnest, because the International Seabed Authority has yet to finalize rules governing extraction. This authority oversees the 54% of the world’s oceans beyond territorial waters. But plans for deep-sea mining operations can still be submitted and considered without these rules in place. Analysts have estimated seabed minerals could be worth a staggering A$30 trillion. Some of the richest deposits lie in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters between Hawaii and Mexico, thousands of kilometers away from Pacific nations. Under international law, companies cannot mine in international waters on their own. They need to be officially sponsored by a national government, which has to keep effective control over its operations. One reason deep-sea mining companies see Pacific states as such useful partners is that these countries can access reserved areas of international seabed set aside for developing countries, as well as potential resources in the very large territorial waters around many island states. Backers in Nauru, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Kiribati argue rising demand for manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel could deliver significant economic returns and diversify economies. Nauru’s enormous deposits of guano – compressed seabird excrement long sought as fertilizer – once made the country wealthy. But the guano is largely gone and the small nation has limited other resources. Nauru sponsors Nauru Ocean Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of seabed mining company The Metals Company. In 2011, the company received an International Seabed Authority contract permitting exploration of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, more than 8,000km from Nauru. Nauru has since “proudly taken a leading role” in developing international legal frameworks in mining nodules in the international seabed. In June, Nauru signalled Nauru Ocean Resources would apply for an exploitation license. Tonga’s government is similarly backing deep-sea mining by partnering with The Metals Company to explore mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. In August 2025, Tonga signed an updated agreement with Tonga Offshore Mining, a subsidiary of The Metals Company. The agreement was originally signed in 2021 amid large-scale criticism over the lack of public consultation. The mining company has promised new benefits, ranging from financial benefits, scholarships and community programs. Even so, the revised deal has encountered opposition from civil society, young people and legal experts. Prominent Tongans remain unconvinced, citing environmental, legal and transparency risks. Economic pressure is part of the picture. Tonga owes an estimated $120 million to China’s Exim Bank – roughly a quarter of its annual GDP. Cook Islands The 15 Cook Islands are widely scattered, giving the government exclusive rights to almost two million square kilometers of ocean. The government has issued exploration licenses inside its Exclusive Economic Zone to three companies – Cook Islands Consortium, CIIC Seabed Resources Limited, and Moana Minerals. The Cook Islands government has established a domestic regulatory framework and is building research capacity. Kiribati’s atolls and island are even more dispersed. The nation’s exclusive economic zone covers about 3.4 million km2. The state-owned Marawa Research and Exploration company holds a 15-year exploration contract with the seabed authority. Kiribati has opened talks with China to explore potential collaboration. The Pacific split While revenues could potentially be sizeable for the Pacific, costs, technologies and environmental liabilities are highly uncertain. The experience of Papua New Guinea is a cautionary tale. In 2019, the PNG deep-sea mining venture Solwara-1 went into administration following intense community pushback. The fallout cost the government an estimated $184 million. The PNG government now opposes deep-sea mining in its territorial waters. Nautilus Mineral’s Solwara-1 deep-sea mining project in Papua New Guinea wound up in 2019. Pictured: the company’s three seabed mining vehicles. Credit Nautilus Minerals / handout image While deep-sea mining now has clear backers, other nations are far more wary. In 2022, Palau launched an alliance calling for a moratorium on mining in international waters. Early signatories included Fiji, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands have joined, as well as dozens of other countries. PNG has not yet joined. Opposition from these Pacific states is based on the precautionary principle, which favors caution when knowledge is limited and damage is possible. Pacific youth are among the most prominent opponents of deep-sea mining. The regional Pacific Blue Line coalition uniting civil society, faith groups, women’s organizations and youth networks has consistently called for a complete ban in the region. Young people have spoke out publicly in nations such as Tonga, where youth advocates criticized limited consultation and rallied against the plans, as well as the Cook Islands, where young people have demanded transparency. Reputation under a cloud? Pacific leaders have built a worldwide reputation for their principled climate diplomacy, from championing the 1.5°C goal to the major new advisory opinion on climate change issued by the world’s top court in response to a case instigated by students from the University of the South Pacific. If some Pacific leaders open the door fully to deep-sea mining, it risks undermining the region’s united front on environmental issues and threatens its credibility. The way this plays out will shape how the world hears the Pacific on climate and the oceans in the years ahead. Kolaia Raisele is a PhD Candidate in Anthropology, La Trobe University.

Norway Orders Five Anti-Submarine Frigates From UK for $13.5 Billion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/norway-orders-five-anti-submarine-frigates-from-uk-for-13-5-billion,,31/08/2025 21:21:46,,"Norway has selected the British Type 26 frigate built by BAE to meet a requirement for ‘at least’ five anti-submarine vessels. The announcement was made jointly by Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Jonas Store on August 31, and is valued for the UK at $13.5 billion. Ships for the Royal Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy are to be built to identical specifications, so that in future logistic chains can be unified, joint crew training conducted and crews exchanged between ships. The decision comes ahead of the announcement of a new UK-Norway defense agreement, and builds on a particularly close naval relationship dating from the Second World War and continued through the Cold War. Royal Marines train annually in Norway to defend the far northern region, which borders Russia, and the HMS Prince of Wales (R09) carrier strike group on its deployment to the Pacific has been supported by the Norwegian Nansen Class frigate HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F311) and the logistic vessel HNoMS Maud (A530). The primary task for the Norwegian Type 26s will be anti-submarine warfare. The weapons fits remain to be fixed, and will no doubt be adjusted for the ships destined for both navies to take into account the strength of Norwegian missile manufacturers such as Kongsberg. The frigates will have hangars to integrate an anti-submarine warfare helicopter into the ship’s surveillance and attack capability. BAE’s Type 26 won out against stiff competition from Naval Group’s FDI, Germany’s F-127 and the American Constellation Class. The Type 26 has also been ordered for domestic manufacture by Australia (six Hunter Class ships) and Canada (fifteen River Class ships).",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32
UK Denies the Royal Navy Cannot Meet Operational Tasking,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-denies-the-royal-navy-cannot-meet-operational-tasking,,31/08/2025 21:10:00,,"Information from multiple sources suggests that the Royal Navy is now unable to meet commitments in several important areas, contrary to UK Ministry of Defence insistence that it is continuing to meet its operational tasking. A pattern of over-reliance on allies for support in order to maintain basic operational capabilities is apparent in a number of areas. For political reasons the Ministry appears unwilling to acknowledge the difficulties. But the problems are now so widespread that the collapse in capability has become glaringly obvious, and all too embarrassing for friends and allies to mention. The state of affairs is primarily a responsibility of British governments over many years who have shrunk the defense budget and delayed shipbuilding decisions, such that vessels are going out of service before new ships are delivered. At the same time, insufficient numbers of ships are being built to meet operational tasking, and the situation is compounded by a crisis in recruitment and retention. The issues are affecting operational capability across the whole fleet, and are not restricted to discreet capability areas. In the Indo-Pacific, HMS Prince of Wales (R09) continues its long-range deployment. But the Royal Navy is only fielding two of its protective escorts, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless (D33) and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond (F239), the others being provided by a changing cast of ships from Norway, Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. For half of its deployment, the Carrier Strike Group has relied on a Norwegian replenishment ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary being unable to field RFA Tidespring (A136) for the entire cruise. Meanwhile on deck, the carrier is only supporting two squadrons of F-35s, half the number it was designed to carry. Much smaller flattops, for example in the Italian Navy, carry similar numbers of aircraft. Of six Type 45 destroyers, only two are operational, with HMS Daring (D32) about to return to service after a refit lasting over 3,000 days. The eight remaining Type 23 frigates are 30 years old, kept operational only with great difficulty, amongst them HMS Lancaster (F229), rumored likely to be withdrawn from Bahrain this year without replacement. The Type 23s are being replaced by Type 26s, with HMS Glasgow due in service in 2028, and Type 31s, with HMS Venturer due in service by 2027. Even if there are no shipbuilding delays, in 2026 and 2027 the Royal Navy risks being down to less than five frigates, all of dubious serviceability. It is also possible that the Norwegian order for five Type 26 frigates announced on August 31 could delay delivery of some of the eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy through the reallocation of production slots. Underwater, delays in ordering new nuclear ballistic missile submarines mean that the Vanguard Class boats are suffering prolonged unserviceability. The need to always have one ‘bomber’ at sea has meant that three-month deployments are frequently extended, in one case in 2023 to six months. Prolonged deployments generate a whole series of problems, such as crew mental health and retention issues, and inevitably systems on board either fail or scheduled maintenance is missed, risky events in nuclear submarines. The consequences of running the Vanguard boats well beyond their design life will persist until at least the early 2030s, when new Dreadnought Class submarines currently being built start coming into service. The situation with attack submarines is equally dire. The last Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Triumph (S93) was decommissioned in July. Of seven Astute Class submarines to be built, five are commissioned, but only one is believed to be operational, probably committed to protecting the on-station nuclear ballistic submarine at sea. None is available to counter the still-powerful Russian submarine force elsewhere, which probably explains why a recent Russian submarine alarm in the northern Norwegian Sea had to be covered at huge cost by P8 Poseidon aircraft instead. In support of the fleet at sea, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is suffering a manning crisis, and can probably only put four ships to sea. The only healthy component of the fleet appears to be the offshore patrol vessels of the River Class, five of which are deployed to maintain the historic Royal Navy global presence, albeit with their limited firepower. The vessels cover for the shortage of destroyers and frigates - but without any anti-aircraft or anti-submarine capability. Royal Thai Navy versions of the same River Class design have a 76mm gun and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Omani versions have a 76mm gun and Exocet missiles, but the Royal Navy ships for cost reasons only have a 30mm Bushmaster cannon. For the next few years, until ships under construction come into service, Royal Navy planners will be praying that no operational emergencies arise - because so few ships are available to meet contingencies. It will be a struggle to maintain the underwater nuclear deterrent; there will be a single minesweeper in the Gulf to handle inevitable crises; issues generated by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine continue. But all the while, threats multiply and the seriousness of the lack of capability goes unrecognized.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32

Freighter Hits Explosive Device off Odesa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/freighter-hits-explosive-device-off-odesa,,01/09/2025 06:03:36,,"A small freighter encountered an explosive device and suffered a blast in waters off the coast of Odesa, according to Ukrainian media. Ukraine's Black Sea shipping corridor is known for the risk of drifting explosive devices and occasional Russian attacks. Sea mines linked to the Ukraine conflict have been found as far away as Georgia, on the other side of the Black Sea. The navies of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey have removed countless mines from the water, but despite countermeasures, chance encounters still happen. In this case, the Belize-flagged freighter NS Pride was operating off Chornomorsk - just south of Odesa's harbor - when it struck an unidentified floating explosive device. The vessel was in ballast at the time of the casualty, and there were no injuries reported. ""The ship sustained minor damage and is currently being inspected. It is likely to continue its journey under its own power,"" Ukrainian Navy spokesman Dmitry Pletenchuck told local outlet Dumskaya. ""Unfortunately, due to the actions of the Russian invaders, a large number of explosive objects remain at sea. And in a constantly moving maritime environment, it is, of course, impossible to predict such incidents with 100% certainty."" Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reports that it is possible that the object was the remains of a Russian-Iranian Shahed drone that had been shot down by Ukrainian forces. The other strong possibility is a drifting sea mine. NS Pride is an Albanian-owned, Belize-flagged coastal freighter of about 3,400 dwt. Built in 1988 and approaching her 40th year in service, the vessel has changed names eight times since 2001 and has a questionable inspection record. Her typical trading pattern alternates between Greece, Sicily and Tunisia; on this voyage, she departed from that pattern and made multiple stops in Turkey before heading further north to Odesa, hugging the coast to stay closer to Bulgaria and Romania, AIS data provided by Pole Star shows.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50
Study: Collapse of Key Atlantic Ocean Current May Begin As Early As 2060,https://maritime-executive.com/article/study-collapse-of-key-atlantic-ocean-current-may-begin-as-early-as-2060,,01/09/2025 05:41:11,,"In the past few years, there has been a growing body of research looking into the potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(AMOC). It is the Atlantic branch of the global ocean current system, responsible for transporting warm ocean water to the north, where it sinks and returns as cold, deep water to the South Atlantic. This circulation helps control the Northwestern European climate. In fact, AMOC is part of the reason Northern Hemisphere is on average 1.40C warmer than the Southern Hemisphere. However, researchers have revealed rising risks for AMOC to reach a tipping point, especially as the global climate system changes. A key destabilizing factor for AMOC is changes in ocean salinity. Back in 1961, the U.S oceanographer Henry Stommel was among the first researchers to recognize how the Atlantic’s water salinity leads to AMOC tipping point. But as this research has progressed with time, there has been speculation about the role played by climate change. Last week, researchers from Utrecht University in Netherlands released a groundbreaking study on the nexus between climate change and AMOC collapse. While the researchers published an almost similar study last year, the new paper uses data from the latest climate models contained under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The recent IPCC report is based on data from CMIP6, which consists of climate models from various institutes around the world. Under CMIP6, some of the models have global warming projections beyond year 2100. This has provided a more granular approach in analyzing systems such as AMOC. Unfortunately, the findings are concerning. Although previous studies indicated that AMOC collapse before 2100 was unlikely, the new paper shows that the tipping point could begin as early as 2060. “The risk of a tipping point by 2100 is over 90% under a high-emission scenario and over 50% under an intermediate climate change scenario,” said René van Westen, co-author of the study. In this case, a tipping point is when deep convection in the northern Atlantic stops. One approach to the AMOC shut down is the ongoing loss of ice in the Arctic, which adds freshwater in the Atlantic, affecting the ocean salinity levels. “The study provides rough estimates but main point is - this is a risk I used to consider less than 10%, and given the devastating impacts lasting many centuries we really want this to be less than 1%,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was also part of the study team. A full shut down of AMOC would cause severe climate disruptions. Some studies have showed that if AMOC weakens, sea levels on the American northeast coastline would rise sharply. On the other side, cold air temperatures would expand to cover Iceland, Britain and Scandinavia, with unprecedented storms.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50
German Seaports Eye Defense Funding to Build Infrastructure,https://maritime-executive.com/article/german-seaports-eye-defense-funding-to-build-infrastructure,,01/09/2025 03:12:25,,"As Europe ramps up funding for its defense, German ports want to see some of the new resources used to strengthen transport infrastructure against potential military attacks. In a recent letter to the German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, the Central Association of German Seaport Operators (ZDS) emphasized that ports form the first line of attack in a war scenario. In addition, ports are critical in military deployment. In an emergency, materials and soldiers of the German military and NATO partners would have to be moved through seaports. ZDS estimates that an initial $3.5 billion is needed to ready German ports for wartime emergencies. “We must prepare for this, even if we hope that it never comes to a real emergency. History has taught us this,” said ZDS. The funding should be part of the defense budget and utilized to secure vulnerable port areas and associated infrastructure. These include quay walls, cyber systems and railway facilities. ZDS recommended a dual-use approach for the funding, catering for both civilian and military needs. Germany’s defense budget is poised to more than double until 2029, from about $72 billion in 2025 to more than $177 billion in the next four years. Part of the funds are earmarked for expanding transport infrastructure, especially roads and railways that are already considered as militarily relevant. With the ZDS proposal, the funding would also be extended to ports. Some of Germany’s most important seaports by cargo throughput include Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Wilhelmshaven and Rostock. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Germany has responded by strengthening the capabilities of its military. This has meant defense preparations for potential Russian aggression. This week, German media carried reports that the federal government is finalizing a military railway system to support NATO’s eastern flank. The exercise includes mapping critical infrastructure sites that would be prioritized in case of an attack. Separately, ZDS has also been highlighting the aging port infrastructure in Germany. New climate regulations and shifts in global trade are putting pressure on the shipping industry to transform. Unfortunately, the financing availed to ports in Germany has been criticized as insufficient for any meaningful development, and ZDS says that the needs come to about $17 billion. Currently, the federal government pays the states around $45 million annually for seaports. However, there have been some milestones, with the federal government last month announcing $467 million in funding to ports. The investment will go into modernization and building infrastructure for green shipping. Top image: Carsten Steger / CC BY SA 4.0",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50

Port of Tauranga Slams Latest Delay in Approving Expansion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-tauranga-slams-latest-delay-in-approving-expansion,,01/09/2025 06:42:02,,"New Zealand’s biggest port, Tauranga, has slammed further delays in the long-delayed review of large-scale improvements to its harbor, which it says would pump millions of dollars into the country’s economy. The project has been in the consenting system for more than six years. Tauranga’s application for its greenlighting under the Fast-track Approvals Act was halted by a judicial review due to a ""legislative drafting error"" that left the words “Mount Maunganui wharves” out of the project description. A fast-track panel, which was intended to commence sittings on September 1 to review the project and potentially approve it, has indefinitely been put on hold by the High Court. Port of Tauranga has described the decision as both “ludicrous” and “frustrating”, and it says the delays in approving the project are reaching crisis point. The port is being forced to turn away shipping services due to a lack of berth capacity, and New Zealand is facing the risk of being bypassed by international services, the port warns. Last month, for instance, the port was forced to decline a proposed new service to the Americas that would have saved New Zealand importers and exporters millions per year in freight costs. A report by the NZ Institute of Economic Research has also estimated that, without the container berth extension, the country will miss out on NZ$485 million to NZ$749 million of annual gross domestic product by 2032. “It is very frustrating that in the midst of significant interest from international container lines, we are unable to support new trade opportunities because we don’t have the berth space,” said Julia Hoare, Port of Tauranga Chair. “We have also lost the flexibility to readily manage congestion when ships turn up off-schedule. When arrivals bunch up, we’re forced to further delay ships at anchor and productivity decreases."" Currently, the port has a dedicated container terminal at Sulphur Point, with bulk cargo wharves at Mount Maunganui, both of which are connected by the Tauranga Harbor Bridge. The Sulphur Point container berths are operating at almost full capacity due to demand and the growing global trend that is seeing the building of larger ships. The new project aims to convert existing cargo storage land into usable berths on both sides of the harbor, growing the port's capacity. The first stage of Sulphur Point extension will add 285 meters of berth to the south of the existing wharves and will allow the port to expand capacity from the current 1.2 million TEU to 2 million TEU annually. This will enable the terminal to accommodate three or four ships at once, instead of the current two. The Mount Maunganui expansion involves a berth extension of 315 meters (plus mooring dolphins), a development that is aimed at relieving capacity pressure and allowing for the future replacement of the oldest, original part of the port, midway along the Mount wharves. Despite the controversies facing the Stella Passage project, Tauranga has had stellar performance over the past financial year. New Zealand’s busiest port posted a seven percent increase in total trade to 25.3 million tonnes with container volumes increasing by 5.3 percent to 1.2 million TEUs. During the year, the port saw its profits hit NZ$126 million, a 23% increase year over year.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 15:43:13
Vessel Reports Explosion in the Water off Saudi Red Sea Coast,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-reports-explosion-in-the-water-off-saudi-red-sea-coast,,01/09/2025 06:10:12,,"A merchant vessel may have narrowly avoided an attack off the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, an area that has previously had comparatively few security issues for passing traffic. The reported incident follows just days after an Israeli strike eliminated top Houthi leaders. At about 1730 hours UTC on Sunday, the master of an unnamed vessel informed UKMTO that they had seen a splash in the water near the ship, followed by a loud bang. The crew is safe, and no damage was reported. The vessel remains under way. Investigations are in process and UKMTO has asked for passing traffic to report any suspicious activity. A Houthi spokesman later identified the vessel in question as the tanker Scarlet Ray, and said that it had been ""hit"" by a ballistic missile - contrary to the ship's own reports. AIS data suggests that Scarlet Ray had been loitering off Yanbu, and that her GPS signal was disrupted by spoofing in the weeks prior to the incident; the signal has not been received since midday Sunday. The area of the incident is more than 600 nautical miles north of the highest-risk Red Sea region, the waters just off Houthi-controlled parts of western Yemen. Waters off Yanbu are within the Saudi exclusive economic zone, and rarely see disturbances of the kind that plagued the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden last year. Observers have been quick to note that the claimed attack followed three days after a major Israeli airstrike on Houthi leaders. The Israeli attack killed the group's prime minister, Ahmed al-Rahawi, and several associates, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told the New York Times. Others believed dead include foreign minister Jamal Amer and information minister Hashem Sharaf el-Din. The Houthis have vowed to take revenge: the group's militia council chief Mahdi al-Mashat said Sunday that ""our vengeance does not sleep, and dark days await you."" Multiple analysts have assessed that the strikes on the Houthis' political leadership - including moderates - are likely to drive the group to take more kinetic action, potentially including more actions against shipping. For more than a month, the group has focused its aim on striking Israeli territory rather than disrupting merchant traffic; after Houthi forces hit and then sank the Greek bulker Eternity C, no further reported attacks followed off the coast of Yemen for about six weeks.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 15:43:13

The Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore is reporting that there was a small fuel spill that was expected to evaporate and break down in the environment, and that both vessels were stable. Few details were released after the Marine Dynamo (8,270 dwt) collided with the bulker Flag Gangos (56,526 dwt). The vessels were reported to be approximately 5 miles offshore in the western area near Tanah Merah. The collision was reported at 0925 local time, with the MPA saying that a patrol boat, spill response craft, and a drone were deployed. The master of Marine Dynamo reported that the vessel had spilled Marine Gas Oil (MGO) used for the barge’s propulsion. One crewmember aboard the vessel was also reported to have suffered bruises and sprains and was being treated onboard. The bulker involved in the collision, Flag Gagnos, Greek-owned and registered in Malta. The ship was heading for Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. Marine Dynamo was built in 2023 as one of the two hybrid electric bunker barges for V-Bunkers (Vitol) and chartered in 2024 to Chevron for operations around Singapore. The ship has an electric power system that made it possible to reduce from three to two the number of auxiliary engines installed. It has a 480 kWh energy storage system, which was expected to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 20 percent. Chevron said lessons from the operation would be instrumental in expanding the operation of hybrid vessels. The MPA is reporting that there is no impact on navigational safety, but it has issued a warning to passing vessels.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Cruise Industry Sues Hawaii Saying “Green Fee” is Unconstitutional,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/cruise-industry-sues-hawaii-saying-green-fee-is-unconstitutional,,01/09/2025 19:22:56,,"The cruise industry has taken the unusual step of filing a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a new Hawaiian law that they claim is unconstitutional and will impose unreasonable fees on cruise ships docking in the state. At issue is a new law known as the “Green Fee” enacted in Hawaii in May and due to go into effect on January 1, increasing the state tax on hotels and short-term rentals, and for the first time extending the tax to cruise ship passengers. The state government ratified the first-of-its-kind legislation this year, saying it would provide funding to deal with the impacts of climate change on its resources. It cited beach erosion and the devastating fire on Maui in 2023. Experts have predicted the new taxes could raise as much as $100 million annually. Hotel guests and short-term rentals have long been paying taxes in Hawaii. The new law increases the tax on those visitors from the current 10.25 percent, adding .75 percent for a total of 11 percent of their stay, with various exemptions. At the same time, the law imposes for the first time an 11 percent “Green Fee” on cruise ship passengers for the time their ship is docked in Hawaiian ports and also gives the local government the authority to collect an additional 3 percent surcharge. The trade group Cruise Lines International Association, along with several representatives of Hawaii businesses impacted by the cruise tax, filed suit in U.S. District Court for Hawaii on August 27, seeking an injunction to block the tax and reporting requirements. According to the suit, the “Green Fee” is a “blatant violation” of the U.S. Constitution, federal Rivers and Harbors regulations, and the principles of freedom of speech. The suit contends that U.S. federal legislation ensures that “navigable waters of the United States are a common resource, not one to be commandeered by individual states for their own parochial revenue-raising interests.” They assert that no other state has attempted this type of fee, which they allege will be used to fund the state’s treasury and fund green projects as opposed to being linked to services provided to the cruise ships. The suit highlights the regulations in the federal Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1884 as well as the “tonnage clause” in the U.S. Constitution. They write that Hawaii is violating federal statutory limits on the fees states may impose for the use of navigable waters. They also claim the tax is unfair because it lacks the exemptions provided for hotel and short-term rental guests and is disproportionate for cruise passengers compared to other entities related to tourism in the state. The suit also attacks a provision that requires the cruise ships to post notices about compliance with the fee onboard and include similar information in every advertisement for Hawaii-bound cruises. Since the fee is unconstitutional, they assert the notification is a violation of free speech. Cruises they report bring about 3000,000 tourists annually to Hawaii based on 2023 data. Hawaii government data shows that there were more than 9.6 million visitors to the state in 2023. In the suit, CLIA contends the additional fees will make Hawaii cruises far more expensive for families. They write it will add hundreds of dollars to the cost of popular cruise itineraries that dock in Hawaii’s ports. They suggest that families will forgo trips to Hawaii in favor of other destinations, also hurting the state’s broader economy and businesses in Hawaii that draw revenues from cruise passengers. The suit asks the court to enjoin the state from enforcing the new legislation. A hearing is scheduled for the end of October. The cruise industry has long been known to use its size to pressure destinations that impose taxes or other levies, but this is only the second time that CLIA has filed suit against a state. In 2016, CLIA Alaska sued Juneau, Alaska, as part of its fight with the state over head taxes. That suit also hinged on the “tonnage clause,” and in 2018, the U.S. District Court sided with CLIA that a tax could only be imposed for services that were being provided to the vessel. The following year, CLIA and Juneau reached a settlement in the case over the use of the passenger taxes. The cruise industry has been facing similar pressures internationally. Greece recently imposed new fees to deal with the impact on the most popular islands after many complained that the ports, such as Santorini and Mykonos, were being overrun by cruise passengers. Mexico also announced a large head tax, but later reached an agreement with the cruise industry for a more phased approach to the fees.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Video: Tugs Race to Secure Containership After Mooring Lines Break,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-tugs-race-to-secure-containership-after-mooring-lines-break,,01/09/2025 19:10:52,,"Images are appearing online showing the moments after a containership broke loose in Brazil’s second-largest port and was moving in the shipping channel. The emergency response team and tugs quickly responded to secure the ship with no damage in the Port of Itajal, south of São Paulo, Brazil. The containership Vincente Pinzon (57,881 dwt) was moored in the port on August 27 when it snapped its mooring lines first at the bow. The vessel began to swing into the busy Itajaí-Açu river before breaking its stern lines and starting to move down the channel. Port officials blamed the strong current in the river, which took control of the vessel. Built in 2014, the ship, which previously operated for Hamburg Sud, has a capacity of 4,848 TEU. It operates a coastal service for the shipping company Alianca Navegacao connecting Brazil’s ports. Port officials said the breakaway happened around 0650, and their emergency team quickly responded to the incident. Tugs can be seen scrambling to secure the 254-meter (833-foot) ship and then turning it 180 degrees and heading it back up the river, all without injuries or serious damage. The pilots were able to gain control of the vessel with the assistance of the tugs. Media reports highlight it was the second time in a matter of months that a similar situation occurred. In December 2024, another containership also broke free. Concern was raised because the ship came very close to the ferry terminal before it was able to be brought under control. The Port of Itajal is Brazil’s main southern facility serving the key industrial region in the south of the country. The port is slated for modernization and investments to increase efficiency as part of the country’s program to auction concessions in the first quarter of 2026. The initiative includes infrastructure work to allow the berthing of vessels up to 400 meters (1,312 feet) in length at Itajal, dredging the channel to increase the draft to 16 meters (52.5 feet).",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Port of Tauranga Slams Latest Delay in Approving Expansion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-tauranga-slams-latest-delay-in-approving-expansion,,01/09/2025 06:42:02,,"New Zealand’s biggest port, Tauranga, has slammed further delays in the long-delayed review of large-scale improvements to its harbor, which it says would pump millions of dollars into the country’s economy. The project has been in the consenting system for more than six years. Tauranga’s application for its greenlighting under the Fast-track Approvals Act was halted by a judicial review due to a ""legislative drafting error"" that left the words “Mount Maunganui wharves” out of the project description. A fast-track panel, which was intended to commence sittings on September 1 to review the project and potentially approve it, has indefinitely been put on hold by the High Court. Port of Tauranga has described the decision as both “ludicrous” and “frustrating”, and it says the delays in approving the project are reaching crisis point. The port is being forced to turn away shipping services due to a lack of berth capacity, and New Zealand is facing the risk of being bypassed by international services, the port warns. Last month, for instance, the port was forced to decline a proposed new service to the Americas that would have saved New Zealand importers and exporters millions per year in freight costs. A report by the NZ Institute of Economic Research has also estimated that, without the container berth extension, the country will miss out on NZ$485 million to NZ$749 million of annual gross domestic product by 2032. “It is very frustrating that in the midst of significant interest from international container lines, we are unable to support new trade opportunities because we don’t have the berth space,” said Julia Hoare, Port of Tauranga Chair. “We have also lost the flexibility to readily manage congestion when ships turn up off-schedule. When arrivals bunch up, we’re forced to further delay ships at anchor and productivity decreases."" Currently, the port has a dedicated container terminal at Sulphur Point, with bulk cargo wharves at Mount Maunganui, both of which are connected by the Tauranga Harbor Bridge. The Sulphur Point container berths are operating at almost full capacity due to demand and the growing global trend that is seeing the building of larger ships. The new project aims to convert existing cargo storage land into usable berths on both sides of the harbor, growing the port's capacity. The first stage of Sulphur Point extension will add 285 meters of berth to the south of the existing wharves and will allow the port to expand capacity from the current 1.2 million TEU to 2 million TEU annually. This will enable the terminal to accommodate three or four ships at once, instead of the current two. The Mount Maunganui expansion involves a berth extension of 315 meters (plus mooring dolphins), a development that is aimed at relieving capacity pressure and allowing for the future replacement of the oldest, original part of the port, midway along the Mount wharves. Despite the controversies facing the Stella Passage project, Tauranga has had stellar performance over the past financial year. New Zealand’s busiest port posted a seven percent increase in total trade to 25.3 million tonnes with container volumes increasing by 5.3 percent to 1.2 million TEUs. During the year, the port saw its profits hit NZ$126 million, a 23% increase year over year.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Vessel Reports Explosion in the Water off Saudi Red Sea Coast,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-reports-explosion-in-the-water-off-saudi-red-sea-coast,,01/09/2025 06:10:12,,"A merchant vessel may have narrowly avoided an attack off the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, an area that has previously had comparatively few security issues for passing traffic. The reported incident follows just days after an Israeli strike eliminated top Houthi leaders. At about 1730 hours UTC on Sunday, the master of an unnamed vessel informed UKMTO that they had seen a splash in the water near the ship, followed by a loud bang. The crew is safe, and no damage was reported. The vessel remains under way. Investigations are in process and UKMTO has asked for passing traffic to report any suspicious activity. A Houthi spokesman later identified the vessel in question as the tanker Scarlet Ray, and said that it had been ""hit"" by a ballistic missile - contrary to the ship's own reports. AIS data suggests that Scarlet Ray had been loitering off Yanbu, and that her GPS signal was disrupted by spoofing in the weeks prior to the incident; the signal has not been received since midday Sunday. The area of the incident is more than 600 nautical miles north of the highest-risk Red Sea region, the waters just off Houthi-controlled parts of western Yemen. Waters off Yanbu are within the Saudi exclusive economic zone, and rarely see disturbances of the kind that plagued the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb and Gulf of Aden last year. Observers have been quick to note that the claimed attack followed three days after a major Israeli airstrike on Houthi leaders. The Israeli attack killed the group's prime minister, Ahmed al-Rahawi, and several associates, Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti told the New York Times. Others believed dead include foreign minister Jamal Amer and information minister Hashem Sharaf el-Din. The Houthis have vowed to take revenge: the group's militia council chief Mahdi al-Mashat said Sunday that ""our vengeance does not sleep, and dark days await you."" Multiple analysts have assessed that the strikes on the Houthis' political leadership - including moderates - are likely to drive the group to take more kinetic action, potentially including more actions against shipping. For more than a month, the group has focused its aim on striking Israeli territory rather than disrupting merchant traffic; after Houthi forces hit and then sank the Greek bulker Eternity C, no further reported attacks followed off the coast of Yemen for about six weeks.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Freighter Hits Explosive Device off Odesa,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/freighter-hits-explosive-device-off-odesa,,01/09/2025 06:03:36,,"A small freighter encountered an explosive device and suffered a blast in waters off the coast of Odesa, according to Ukrainian media. Ukraine's Black Sea shipping corridor is known for the risk of drifting explosive devices and occasional Russian attacks. Sea mines linked to the Ukraine conflict have been found as far away as Georgia, on the other side of the Black Sea. The navies of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey have removed countless mines from the water, but despite countermeasures, chance encounters still happen. In this case, the Belize-flagged freighter NS Pride was operating off Chornomorsk - just south of Odesa's harbor - when it struck an unidentified floating explosive device. The vessel was in ballast at the time of the casualty, and there were no injuries reported. ""The ship sustained minor damage and is currently being inspected. It is likely to continue its journey under its own power,"" Ukrainian Navy spokesman Dmitry Pletenchuck told local outlet Dumskaya. ""Unfortunately, due to the actions of the Russian invaders, a large number of explosive objects remain at sea. And in a constantly moving maritime environment, it is, of course, impossible to predict such incidents with 100% certainty."" Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reports that it is possible that the object was the remains of a Russian-Iranian Shahed drone that had been shot down by Ukrainian forces. The other strong possibility is a drifting sea mine. NS Pride is an Albanian-owned, Belize-flagged coastal freighter of about 3,400 dwt. Built in 1988 and approaching her 40th year in service, the vessel has changed names eight times since 2001 and has a questionable inspection record. Her typical trading pattern alternates between Greece, Sicily and Tunisia; on this voyage, she departed from that pattern and made multiple stops in Turkey before heading further north to Odesa, hugging the coast to stay closer to Bulgaria and Romania, AIS data provided by Pole Star shows.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Study: Collapse of Key Atlantic Ocean Current May Begin As Early As 2060,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/study-collapse-of-key-atlantic-ocean-current-may-begin-as-early-as-2060,,01/09/2025 05:41:11,,"In the past few years, there has been a growing body of research looking into the potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(AMOC). It is the Atlantic branch of the global ocean current system, responsible for transporting warm ocean water to the north, where it sinks and returns as cold, deep water to the South Atlantic. This circulation helps control the Northwestern European climate. In fact, AMOC is part of the reason Northern Hemisphere is on average 1.40C warmer than the Southern Hemisphere. However, researchers have revealed rising risks for AMOC to reach a tipping point, especially as the global climate system changes. A key destabilizing factor for AMOC is changes in ocean salinity. Back in 1961, the U.S oceanographer Henry Stommel was among the first researchers to recognize how the Atlantic’s water salinity leads to AMOC tipping point. But as this research has progressed with time, there has been speculation about the role played by climate change. Last week, researchers from Utrecht University in Netherlands released a groundbreaking study on the nexus between climate change and AMOC collapse. While the researchers published an almost similar study last year, the new paper uses data from the latest climate models contained under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The recent IPCC report is based on data from CMIP6, which consists of climate models from various institutes around the world. Under CMIP6, some of the models have global warming projections beyond year 2100. This has provided a more granular approach in analyzing systems such as AMOC. Unfortunately, the findings are concerning. Although previous studies indicated that AMOC collapse before 2100 was unlikely, the new paper shows that the tipping point could begin as early as 2060. “The risk of a tipping point by 2100 is over 90% under a high-emission scenario and over 50% under an intermediate climate change scenario,” said René van Westen, co-author of the study. In this case, a tipping point is when deep convection in the northern Atlantic stops. One approach to the AMOC shut down is the ongoing loss of ice in the Arctic, which adds freshwater in the Atlantic, affecting the ocean salinity levels. “The study provides rough estimates but main point is - this is a risk I used to consider less than 10%, and given the devastating impacts lasting many centuries we really want this to be less than 1%,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was also part of the study team. A full shut down of AMOC would cause severe climate disruptions. Some studies have showed that if AMOC weakens, sea levels on the American northeast coastline would rise sharply. On the other side, cold air temperatures would expand to cover Iceland, Britain and Scandinavia, with unprecedented storms.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Bringing Command and Accountability Back to Surface Fleet Maintenance,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/bringing-command-and-accountability-back-to-surface-fleet-maintenance,,01/09/2025 03:40:34,,"There are times when “the way things are” are no longer acceptable. Radical change, with incremental and careful execution, is urgently needed within the US Navy’s Surface Ship Repair Maintenance enterprise to rectify the shortcomings of two decades of well-intentioned initiatives that rendered a majority of Surface ships neglected and ill-equipped for combat. The problem is not wholly maintenance related – the contributing issues came about as an aggregate result of the Navy’s increased operational tempo since the start of the Global War on Terror, changes in Surface Force manning models, and disputes with Congress over the decommissioning of certain classes of ships, among other things. Recent operations in the Red Sea today are eerily reminiscent of the world in 2002 when we stretched the Navy thin to answer the nation’s call – and paid a price for decades. A recent GAO report highlighted the impact of manning shortages to ship crew’s ability to perform corrective maintenance; over 75 percent of Executive Officers stated that it was “difficult or very difficult” to complete required corrective maintenance. To address the lack of sustained success, and avoid the missteps of the past, the Surface Force and NAVSEA should employ a multi-tiered approach primarily centered on retaking control of shipboard maintenance to get us fair in the channel again. 2002-2010: MSMO and Management Failure The story begins with the war in the Middle East in 2003. For the first time in decades, the Navy’s answer to the nation’s call to action, pushed the fleet forward, and kept it there, using its Tomahawks and Marines to enable an immensely successful land campaign. It was not by coincidence that the president chose an aircraft carrier as a platform to announce “Mission Accomplished.” The cost of that prolonged surge, however, was the deferral of a mountain of maintenance that had been scheduled for the ships and then canceled. The Navy needed to invent a way to get those ships back in service quickly and efficiently. Working with industry, the Navy developed a plan that would leverage the strengths of certain shipyards for certain types of maintenance and provide stability for the workforce by bundling multiple ships of the same class together with the idea that this would result in money savings and efficiencies in the process. This plan, called MSMO (Multi-Ship-Multi-Option) plan was implemented in the early 2000’s. As envisioned, this plan was a good idea, however naval officers know very little about the business world. There was an implicit assumption in the execution of the MSMO plan that the Navy would save money by encouraging the industry to voluntarily decrease their bottom line. Read that again. It was never going to happen, and it didn’t happen. As a contractor following my retirement, I learned that ship repair business is just that – a business. Right or wrong, income is predicated on the Navy spending money to fix ships – any significant efficiencies in that process result in less money spent, and thus less profit. Less profit makes stockholders unhappy and drives businesses out of business. At the same time, the Navy decided to save manpower dollars for other programs such as the Optimal Manning and Top Six Rolldown initiatives, which reduced shipboard manning and mandated the dissolution of the Ships Intermediate Maintenance Activities (SIMAs), which had been around since the early 1980s. In fact, the GAO reports that the backlog of incomplete maintenance exceeded any savings from manpower cuts that were instituted as part of Optimal Manning and other reductions in shipboard manning. The SIMA dissolution was especially problematic since SIMAs were primarily designed to be focused on two things: leveraging Sailors on shore duty to conduct relatively minor and mid-level repairs using the expertise gained at sea and training shipboard Sailors in their technical rating. The elimination of SIMAs had a second impact: it meant all work had to go to contractors at a much higher price. While it may be true that the cost of SIMA was higher than the projected cost of giving the work to private industry – SIMA was cheaper only if you did not consider the actual cost of SIMA, e.g. salaries, facilities, etc., the Sailor cost was already spent, and the training and experience of working on equipment in-rate on shore duty is difficult to put a price tag on. An additional phenomenon I observed was that the cadre of government planners who performed availability and maintenance planning and preparations were released and hired by contractors as this process moved to industry under the Multi Ship Multi Option (MSMO) strategy. This did not change the net number of personnel in this area, but it made the cost and scope of those with this skill set a bit more difficult to track and quantify, and may have added a cost to the process as well. In parallel, the Navy drastically reduced the footprint of an organization called Supervisor of Shipbuilding, who was basically the “overseer” designed to hold the ship builders and ship maintainers honest and uphold standards. Around this timeframe (roughly 2007-2010), another dynamic came and went: Ship Class Squadrons, or CLASSRONs. Modeled after the Naval Aviation Enterprise, these groups were formed around each ship class and were given control of maintenance funding, acquisition processes, and current readiness. Led by sequential major commanders with experience in a specific ship class, they consolidated processes, lessons learned, assessments, and maintenance under one individual – wearing a command pin. They also tracked Class Advisories and major modifications across a focused subset of ships. As a cruiser commanding officer, I (Cordle) was overwhelmingly satisfied with the support received by the class advocate. In my specific case, the Cruiser CLASSRON Commander had held my job before, and therefore understood it. The CLASSRON Commander had the time and bandwidth to deal with roughly 20 ships compared with the current model where one Engineering Duty Officer Captain has to process all of the maintenance information associated with over 100 ships on each coast. The CLASSRON initiative was not given enough “bake time” and would have likely produced significant dividends if left in place. This occurred in 2012 with the justification that it created a parallel C2 process and muddied the waters with respect to funding. In an effort to improve oversight, Commander Navy Regional Maintenance Center, (CNRMC), was established in 2010 to standardize and oversee the Regional Maintenance Centers, whose processes were perceived to have drifted over the years. The goal was to place a flag officer on the waterfront with the supporting staff to police the maintenance process. While initially successful, the center of gravity of that organization has shifted to Washington and away from the waterfront. And in another manning decision, the Navy combined two flag positions, one for ship maintenance and one for modernization, placing arguably the two most complex functions in the Navy enterprise on the shoulders of one junior Flag officer. From this author’s experience, this task is too great for one individual, no matter how Herculean his or her efforts could be – they will always be pulled in two directions – one toward, and one away from the waterfront. 2011-2014: The Trends Worsen In the early 2010s, the VADM Balisle report and subsequent GAO findings were released, indicating a dangerous trend of neglect within the Surface Force. As a result, the Navy looked to reverse course in Sailor maintenance, manpower/manning models, and Officer training – albeit this was a slow change. As an outcrop of these reports and the associated action items, the Navy implemented the Surface Engineering Maintenance Planning Project, SURFMEPP, designed to focus on life cycle maintenance, act as the “conscience of the Navy” to get ships to expected service life, which has been extended several times from 35 to 45 years over the same period. With 2013 entered sequestration, government shutdowns, and funding shortfalls across the enterprise. During my time (Cordle) on active duty, I sat at the front table of Naval Surface Forces Atlantic time and again and signed documents that cut significant lifecycle maintenance from Surface ship availabilities because the money was not available. To be sure, the confluence of these factors did make the MSMO more efficient, more flexible, and able to maximize the work completed, but it did not save money. The other unfortunate side effect was that a lack of rigor and uniformed oversight on the Navy side allowed companies to take advantage of the situation thereby increasing profits, although they arguably used much of the extra income to reinvest and try to grow, train, and pay their workforce in a standard capitalist model (that we laud in most other applications) – but with the Navy as their only paying customer. In the end, industry conducted themselves like any capitalist business that has to make money to stay viable. It is worth noting as background perhaps, but even before sequestration the lack of stability in the funding lines created considerable volatility in the repair community even under MSMO – the long-standing practice of underfunding surface ship maintenance and then using mid-year plus ups to close the gap to meet requirements generates its own uncertainty every fiscal year, as I experienced in my short tenure as a Type Commander Maintenance Officer in 2011 (Cordle). Thus, the MSMO financing vehicle coupled with the elimination of SIMAs, which was initially hailed as a process designed to get the most work done (albeit at a premium price), fell victim to economics, in that the expected savings never materialized. As a result, in the decade that was the 2005 to 2015, the Surface Navy gave away its ability to fix itself and took out title loans on its ships in the form of a maintenance backlog to the tune of billions of dollars. Add to this the compounding “interest” of fewer Sailors with less training conducting shipboard self-evaluation, and you get the expected result: a rather large volume of unaddressed maintenance discrepancies aboard ships. 2015-2020:Replacing MSMO with MACMO About halfway through this journey, in the 2010s after one or two complete change outs of the key leaders who brought MSMO to the table, a new narrative developed: civilian contractors are making too much money and keeping the ships longer to increase their bottom line. Unfortunately, rather than conduct a holistic self-analysis of the system, the Navy abruptly scrapped the MSMO concept in favor of a firm-fixed price, restrictive process that allowed a relatively small set of contractors to bid on large availabilities individually and called it another name bathed in obfuscation: the Multi Award Contract Multi Option, or MACMO, process. Designed to cure the ills of the MSMO process by driving competition and accountability into the system, this was another good idea, but as Admiral (ret) Jesse Wilson once said, “whenever you create a new process you create new problems”. Since this was a fairly classic “top down” initiative, there was not much of an appetite for pushback or critique and not much time to shift the processes to support it. Several established and complex processes were taken on by the government, including the purchasing of long lead time materials and the complex and detailed planning process, without a robust experience base or training program in place to support it. The learning curve for this change was a steep one, and the Navy paid a price in planning and material delays during the transition to this new process. A 2017 GAO report captured the precise cost of these manning decisions, in terms of unexecuted maintenance, in billions of dollars and millions of man-days. The graphs are eye-popping and relevant even today. Manpower Savings were more than offset by increased maintenance costs (Source: GAO) Now came some interesting system dynamics that while predicted, created a new set of issues when juxtaposed against the changes previously mentioned. First, the Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers (DDGs) and the Harpers Ferry-class Landing Ship, Dock ships (LSDs) entered their midlife periods, forcing maintenance availabilities to extend beyond the previous 3 to 5-month durations into durations of 12-18 months. This length change required more planning, more parts, and a larger, better trained workforce in industry, all of which were sub-optimized by the transition to MACMO. Secondly, the Navy also revived the Coast Wide Bid process that surprised many when it actually happened to USS RAMAGE and again to USS SHOUP a few years later. Navy Manpower and manning management processes in both the active duty and civilian side are not aligned to support such endeavors. Thirdly, Congress and the Navy treated the Cruisers and LSDs as chips in a game of poker, alternately placing them on decommissioning lists, cutting their funding to near zero, laying them up, and then trying to bring them back after a bluff has been called. This resulted in huge sunk costs, delays in critical repairs, not to mention the impact on manning and morale of crews that were “strung along” for years in a decommissioning mindset. Like trying to restore the old Ford truck that one would find in their grandfather’s pasture, this effort has grown in cost and magnitude far beyond original estimates, sucking money away from other endeavors. Delays in designing a replacement for these capital ships, which are pretty awesome warfighters, have resulted in their being kept around, with the quandary that no capital ship is as capable, nor as expensive to maintain, as our aged cruisers. 2020-Present: The Consequences A 2020 GAO report found that “since shifting to the Multiple Award Contract-Multi Order (MACMO) contracting approach for ship maintenance work in 2015, the Navy has increased competition opportunities, gained flexibility to ensure quality of work, and limited cost growth, but schedule delays persist. During this period, 21 of 41 ship maintenance periods, called availabilities, for major repair work cost less than initially estimated, and average cost growth across the 41 availabilities was 5 percent. Schedule outcomes were less positive, and Navy regional maintenance centers varied in their performance.2 This is shown in the graph below: Schedule delays under MAC-MO Contracting (Source: GAO) Admiral Galinis, who later commanded NAVSEA as a 3-star, when asked at a 2015 Fleet Maintenance Seminar what changes the MACMO would bring around, he said “two things we will lose are flexibility and teamwork.” In retrospect, he was correct. Unfortunately, they were lost at a time when they were much needed. Another ingredient added to this complex system of setbacks was the ramp up of operational employment based on growing threats in the Pacific and in the Arabian Gulf. This resulted in policies of maintenance deferral and reduced certification requirements, all well documented in the Comprehensive Review of 2017. Righting the Ship In a 2019 article, David Larter described Navy Maintenance as a “dumpster fire.” While we do not fully agree with this dark assessment, it is definitely in need of a good overhaul. Surface Navy leaders have taken some action to help put us in a good place, including: 1. Surface Type Commanders have established a Post-Major Command Surface Warfare O-6 billet to oversee all aspects of the maintenance domain. This brings experience, oversight, and seniority to the process and is starting to pay dividends. 2. Establishment of Surface Readiness Groups – this initiative (which is not new) theoretically restores the positive attributes found in CLASSRONs. Under the Surface Readiness Group model, all ships in the Maintenance Phase are aligned under one Commodore per homeport, allowing a singular focus on maintenance and freeing up the deployed Commodores to focus on warfighting. These are great steps to remedy the problems. Imagine if a Ford F-150 production line had to deal with a change to baseline of about 30 percent – this would be a flawed business model. Yet, this is what we ask the maintenance community to deal with every time a ship enters a yard period. To address this dilemma, the Surface Force needs to improve its scope of work planning for upcoming surface availabilities. Additionally, there should be more margin built into the schedule and price of each availability. Availabilities should start with a measure of float built in, and the Surface Force should resist the urge to plan against this float. Further, the Surface Force should acknowledge that there will be increases to scope and new work, instead of ignoring it or pretending it will not manifest. By leveraging options, frontloads, class maintenance plans, and flexible contracting, it must be possible to fund and plan for both long-term maintenance and current repairs. Things on a ship break all the time, and the process needs to be proactive vice reactive. Additionally, the Navy should consider the following measures: 1. Treat this like the crisis that it is. Assemble a team of the most experienced people and challenge them to come up with a plan but force them to take off their functional “armor” (acquisition, modernization, maintenance, contracting, etc.) to collaborate on a new plan that is innovative, integrated, and responsible. This team should be challenged to openly discuss the best and worst parts of each model from MSMO to MACMO, Firm Fixed Price and Cost-Plus contracts. The narrative that “the utterance of the word MSMO will result in career suicide” is not helpful here. 2. Restore SIMA as a separate command. SIMAs are currently resident within Code 900 at the Regional Maintenance Centers. This construct sub optimizes SIMA’s visibility, employment, and effectiveness. Command is command; and putting a Shore Command Pin on the Commander of Ship Intermediate Maintenance would open additional command opportunities to the Engineering Duty Officer community – and consequently be good for the ships and Sailors. 3. Empower the local shipyard. Currently a Shipyard Commander has relatively no tools or levers to punish or incentivize a lead maintenance activity during a Shipyard availability. For instance, if an LMA neglects to conduct a repair within a prescribed timeline, or the work is not completed to the level of quality that it should, the shipyard has to spend exorbitant amounts of time, resources, and money to present an iron-clad case to fiscally punish the LMA. In many cases, it is more cost effective to not pursue punishment. Conversely, the Shipyard Commander has little to no way of rewarding a LMA who does a job well (on time and/or under budget). Consideration should be given to allowing the Shipyard Commander, with delegation to pertinent Project Managers, to fiscally reward or withhold a relatively small percentage of money at their level. The shipyard represents the “tactical ground commander” and observes many violations in Shipboard maintenance, and has very little ability to affect immediate change. 4. Fix the planning phase of major availabilities. On average, the amount of work during a major availability changes by roughly 30 percent after it begins. This corresponds to a range of 2,000 and 20,000 Requests for Contract Changes (RCCs) depending on the length of the maintenance period. One solution is a “Business Model Cost and Schedule” approach that was published in the Naval Engineer’s Journal in 2021. 5. Revive the good parts of the MSMO strategy to include focusing certain repair yards on certain classes of ships and providing bundled ship contracts over a period of years to allow consistency, gain some efficiencies, and train a workforce for the nation’s future. This approach does not have to be unitary in its contracting strategy but could include a more flexible pricing process described in #1 above. The contracting officers will have issues with this, but we cannot continue to build the maintenance process around the contracting process instead of around the Fleet. Many in the commercial industry have shared that a predictable and dependable income stream are critical to allowing industry to train the workforce and invest in infrastructure. 6. Leverage the goodness of processes like the Continuous Intermediate Availability (CIA) model conducted in Rota, Spain, which is similar to the old 13-week availabilities, where TYCOM-level maintenance is accomplished in short, focused maintenance periods. This could be folded into the OFRP, perhaps at the beginning of the Sustainment Phase right after deployment, and the ship return to service for a while before starting maintenance. To be sure, this initiative will have to be balanced against the need of the Operational Commander. 7. Split the Flag Officer billets for maintenance and modernization. There isn’t a single root cause for many of the current issues, nor is the problem with any particular individual. However, the move to put too many decisions on a single individual’s plate was a singularly bad move and needs to be fixed quickly. 8. Move the commander of CNRMC to Norfolk, and place a deputy in San Diego. The vision of CNRMC that was put in place by USFF in 2010 was to place a Flag Officer on the waterfront overseeing ship’s maintenance. That fundamental tenet has been lost but could be regained relatively simply. The new modernization Flag Officer can satiate the appetite in Washington for information, while their maintenance counterpart can get “boots on the ground” and start extracting ships from the yards with a crowbar instead of a 300-mile towing hawser. Of note, a similar move was just implemented with the creation of a Flag Officer billet to supervise the nuclear shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia. 9. Replicate the Supervisor of Shipbuilding model from the nuclear side at the regional maintenance centers. Empower them to provide oversight, accountability, and rigor to the ship repair process. Put teeth back into the process. Rewrite the NAVSEA Standard Item 009-060 to require contractors to provide a detailed, integrated plan that can be graphed, tracked and used to hold them to account. If there is one thing I hear over and over from Commanding Officers in the yards, it is “who is holding anyone accountable?” You can figure out the answer. No one. 10. Bring back a deployable ship repair capability to replace the Yellowstone Class Destroyer Tenders by installing a full machine repair capability (including Additive Manufacturing) into one Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) class ship in each theater. These multi-purpose platforms have lots of space and could probably support a modular solution as well. Manning could be surged from the Regional Maintenance Centers in time of need. This is not an argument to completely revert to the old way of doing things. This article is formulated from not just our own experiences, but multiple peers who (at least to some extent) feel the same way. One shared, “Firm Fixed Price is a great model for the commercial industry or Maritime Sealift Command, for basic maintenance on ships that are not all that complex; it is exactly the wrong model for complex warships that require expertise, flexibility, and integration – like Navy ships.” There were many sins (including some in which at least one of us was complicit), all well intentioned, and many unavoidable over the years. But by scrapping programs that used to work, and failing to look for another solution, we will all simply admire the problem as more and more of the Fleet is tied to the pier when it is needed most. Instead, the Surface Warfare Community needs to take control of its own destiny, help the Engineering Duty Officer community do its core job, assume responsibility for the maintenance of its ships, increase command opportunity, and inject rigor, decisiveness, and accountability into a system where these words have gone out of style. One key component of any strategy is to “take a fix.” The 2022 GAO report on maintenance backlog provides a stunning insight into the lack of accuracy and estimating the value of deferred maintenance. The amount provided to the GAO was literally off by a factor of 10 ($1.8 billion vs $180 million). This gap was then addressed by accelerating decommissioning of multiple ships which collectively represented about 80% of the gap. Unfortunately this approach addresses the immediate problem without addressing the root cause; its effect will be temporary and cannot be repeated. As today’s Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Readiness Groups engage in global combat operations unparalleled in modern history, with even less ships than we had during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the same forces at work in 2002 are starting to become evident, with deployments stretching to an average of over 220 days and no end in sight. Unless something changes, we are likely to find ourselves in the same position 10 years from now. Captain John Cordle, USN, retired from the Navy in 2013 after 30 years of service. He commanded the USS Oscar Austin (DDG-79) and USS San Jacinto (CG-56), earning a Bronze Star in 2003 and the U.S. Navy League’s Captain John Paul Jones Award for Inspirational Leadership in 2010. He is a Plankowner on CVN 75 and CVN 77, where he served as Reactor Officer. He received the SNA Literary Award in 2014 and 2019, as well as the 2019 ASNE Solberg Award and U. S. Naval Institute Author of the Year Award for his contributions to fatigue management in the United States Navy. In addition to serving as Chief of Staff for Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (SURFLANT), he also served as a Program Manager for Maintenance University at Hunnington Ingalls Industries and as a GS 14 Human Factors Engineer at SURFLANT, where he was recognized with the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Now retired, he is focused on leveraging his life experience to help develop future leaders. Captain Holman Agard, USN, has a combined 27 years of service between the Enlisted and Officer ranks. He currently is serving as the Commanding Officer of USS SHOUP (DDG 86) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Commander for the GEORGE WASHINGTON Carrier Strike Group (CSG-5) based in Yokosuka, Japan.

German Seaports Eye Defense Funding to Build Infrastructure,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/german-seaports-eye-defense-funding-to-build-infrastructure,,01/09/2025 03:12:25,,"As Europe ramps up funding for its defense, German ports want to see some of the new resources used to strengthen transport infrastructure against potential military attacks. In a recent letter to the German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, the Central Association of German Seaport Operators (ZDS) emphasized that ports form the first line of attack in a war scenario. In addition, ports are critical in military deployment. In an emergency, materials and soldiers of the German military and NATO partners would have to be moved through seaports. ZDS estimates that an initial $3.5 billion is needed to ready German ports for wartime emergencies. “We must prepare for this, even if we hope that it never comes to a real emergency. History has taught us this,” said ZDS. The funding should be part of the defense budget and utilized to secure vulnerable port areas and associated infrastructure. These include quay walls, cyber systems and railway facilities. ZDS recommended a dual-use approach for the funding, catering for both civilian and military needs. Germany’s defense budget is poised to more than double until 2029, from about $72 billion in 2025 to more than $177 billion in the next four years. Part of the funds are earmarked for expanding transport infrastructure, especially roads and railways that are already considered as militarily relevant. With the ZDS proposal, the funding would also be extended to ports. Some of Germany’s most important seaports by cargo throughput include Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Wilhelmshaven and Rostock. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Germany has responded by strengthening the capabilities of its military. This has meant defense preparations for potential Russian aggression. This week, German media carried reports that the federal government is finalizing a military railway system to support NATO’s eastern flank. The exercise includes mapping critical infrastructure sites that would be prioritized in case of an attack. Separately, ZDS has also been highlighting the aging port infrastructure in Germany. New climate regulations and shifts in global trade are putting pressure on the shipping industry to transform. Unfortunately, the financing availed to ports in Germany has been criticized as insufficient for any meaningful development, and ZDS says that the needs come to about $17 billion. Currently, the federal government pays the states around $45 million annually for seaports. However, there have been some milestones, with the federal government last month announcing $467 million in funding to ports. The investment will go into modernization and building infrastructure for green shipping. Top image: Carsten Steger / CC BY SA 4.0",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Appeals Court Rules That Most of Trump's Tariffs are Unlawful,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/appeals-court-rules-that-most-of-trump-s-tariffs-are-unlawful,,01/09/2025 03:10:29,,"A federal appeals court has affirmed the lower court ruling that invalidated the Trump administration's sweeping nation-by-nation ""retaliatory"" tariffs. The court found that the levies do not have a legal basis under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law that the administration has used to undergird most of its rapidly-shifting tariff announcements. IEEPA was enacted in 1977 to limit the president's power to impose punitive trade measures without Congress' involvement. The act allows the president to take certain trade actions during a declared emergency to respond to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to America's economy or national security. Powers enumerated under the act include blocking tranactions, freezing assets, and (in the event of an actual attack) confiscating property belonging to the threat. The statute limits each ""emergency"" to one year at a time, an attempt to curtail open-ended presidential decrees. It has been used by previous presidents on rare occasions, like sanctioning Al Qaeda, targeting the ayatollahs' regime in Iran, or limiting the finances of Colombian drug gangs. Trump used IEEPA extensively during his first term, and has begun to apply it in earnest since January 2025. Most of his administration's tariffs - including all of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. trading partners - rest on claims of authorities under IEEPA, but the administration has had difficulty defending these applications of the statute in court. In May, the Court of International Trade in New York found that Trump's retaliatory tariffs were not legally justified by IEEPA, but it stayed its decision pending appeal. The administration then took the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; on Friday, the court determined that IEEPA does not give the president any tariff powers (the word tariff does not appear in the text of the statute). Since Congress did not say that it would hand over its constitutional authority to levy tariffs when it wrote IEEPA, the court ruled, Congress did not delegate those powers to the president; though the White House does have other tariff authority under other statutes, the court found that it does not have tariff authority stemming from IEEPA. IEEPA ""neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs,"" the appeals court ruled. ""Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs."" The appeals court stayed its ruling to give time for an appeal to the Supreme Court, which is highly likely. The court has responded favorably on most the administration's requests for emergency stays, and Trump held out hope that it would pause or overrule this court decision as well. ""Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,"" President Trump wrote Friday in a social media post. ""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
Pacific Island Nations are Divided Over Deep Sea Mining,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pacific-island-nations-are-divided-over-deep-sea-mining,,01/09/2025 00:34:59,,"[By Kolaia Raisele and Aidan Craney] In recent years, Pacific island nations have earned global credibility as champions of climate action. Pacific leaders view sea level rise as an existential threat. But this united front is now under strain as some Pacific nations pursue a controversial new industry – deep-sea mining. Nauru, the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Tonga have gone the furthest to make it a reality, attracted by new income streams. But nations such as Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining in international waters. Public opinion across the Pacific is often divided, pitting possible economic gains against the potential risks of an industry whose environmental impact remain uncertain but potentially significant. As this tension intensifies, it may split the Pacific and risk the region’s moral authority on climate. What are the concerns over deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining targets three types of mineral deposits – polymetallic nodules strewn across deep underwater plains, cobalt-rich crusts on seamounts, and the ore deposits around hydrothermal vents. To extract them, mining companies can use unmanned collectors to pump ore to the surface and return the wastewater. This creates plumes of sediment which can smother marine life. Methods of minimizing damage to species from mining on land are largely unworkable at depth. Deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood, but we know they are slow to recover. Researchers have found areas mined as a test more than 40 years ago still show physical damage and immobile corals and sponges remain scarce. Many species live on the seabeds, seamounts and hydrothermal vents which would be targeted for mining. Pictured: a crab crawling across a field of polymetallic nodules near Gosnold Seamount. NOAA, CC BY-NC-ND Why is there so much interest in deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining hasn’t begun anywhere in earnest, because the International Seabed Authority has yet to finalize rules governing extraction. This authority oversees the 54% of the world’s oceans beyond territorial waters. But plans for deep-sea mining operations can still be submitted and considered without these rules in place. Analysts have estimated seabed minerals could be worth a staggering A$30 trillion. Some of the richest deposits lie in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters between Hawaii and Mexico, thousands of kilometers away from Pacific nations. Under international law, companies cannot mine in international waters on their own. They need to be officially sponsored by a national government, which has to keep effective control over its operations. One reason deep-sea mining companies see Pacific states as such useful partners is that these countries can access reserved areas of international seabed set aside for developing countries, as well as potential resources in the very large territorial waters around many island states. Backers in Nauru, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Kiribati argue rising demand for manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel could deliver significant economic returns and diversify economies. Nauru’s enormous deposits of guano – compressed seabird excrement long sought as fertilizer – once made the country wealthy. But the guano is largely gone and the small nation has limited other resources. Nauru sponsors Nauru Ocean Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of seabed mining company The Metals Company. In 2011, the company received an International Seabed Authority contract permitting exploration of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, more than 8,000km from Nauru. Nauru has since “proudly taken a leading role” in developing international legal frameworks in mining nodules in the international seabed. In June, Nauru signalled Nauru Ocean Resources would apply for an exploitation license. Tonga’s government is similarly backing deep-sea mining by partnering with The Metals Company to explore mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. In August 2025, Tonga signed an updated agreement with Tonga Offshore Mining, a subsidiary of The Metals Company. The agreement was originally signed in 2021 amid large-scale criticism over the lack of public consultation. The mining company has promised new benefits, ranging from financial benefits, scholarships and community programs. Even so, the revised deal has encountered opposition from civil society, young people and legal experts. Prominent Tongans remain unconvinced, citing environmental, legal and transparency risks. Economic pressure is part of the picture. Tonga owes an estimated $120 million to China’s Exim Bank – roughly a quarter of its annual GDP. Cook Islands The 15 Cook Islands are widely scattered, giving the government exclusive rights to almost two million square kilometers of ocean. The government has issued exploration licenses inside its Exclusive Economic Zone to three companies – Cook Islands Consortium, CIIC Seabed Resources Limited, and Moana Minerals. The Cook Islands government has established a domestic regulatory framework and is building research capacity. Kiribati’s atolls and island are even more dispersed. The nation’s exclusive economic zone covers about 3.4 million km2. The state-owned Marawa Research and Exploration company holds a 15-year exploration contract with the seabed authority. Kiribati has opened talks with China to explore potential collaboration. The Pacific split While revenues could potentially be sizeable for the Pacific, costs, technologies and environmental liabilities are highly uncertain. The experience of Papua New Guinea is a cautionary tale. In 2019, the PNG deep-sea mining venture Solwara-1 went into administration following intense community pushback. The fallout cost the government an estimated $184 million. The PNG government now opposes deep-sea mining in its territorial waters. Nautilus Mineral’s Solwara-1 deep-sea mining project in Papua New Guinea wound up in 2019. Pictured: the company’s three seabed mining vehicles. Credit Nautilus Minerals / handout image While deep-sea mining now has clear backers, other nations are far more wary. In 2022, Palau launched an alliance calling for a moratorium on mining in international waters. Early signatories included Fiji, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands have joined, as well as dozens of other countries. PNG has not yet joined. Opposition from these Pacific states is based on the precautionary principle, which favors caution when knowledge is limited and damage is possible. Pacific youth are among the most prominent opponents of deep-sea mining. The regional Pacific Blue Line coalition uniting civil society, faith groups, women’s organizations and youth networks has consistently called for a complete ban in the region. Young people have spoke out publicly in nations such as Tonga, where youth advocates criticized limited consultation and rallied against the plans, as well as the Cook Islands, where young people have demanded transparency. Reputation under a cloud? Pacific leaders have built a worldwide reputation for their principled climate diplomacy, from championing the 1.5°C goal to the major new advisory opinion on climate change issued by the world’s top court in response to a case instigated by students from the University of the South Pacific. If some Pacific leaders open the door fully to deep-sea mining, it risks undermining the region’s united front on environmental issues and threatens its credibility. The way this plays out will shape how the world hears the Pacific on climate and the oceans in the years ahead. Kolaia Raisele is a PhD Candidate in Anthropology, La Trobe University.

Norway Orders Five Anti-Submarine Frigates From UK for $13.5 Billion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/norway-orders-five-anti-submarine-frigates-from-uk-for-13-5-billion,,31/08/2025 21:21:46,,"Norway has selected the British Type 26 frigate built by BAE to meet a requirement for ‘at least’ five anti-submarine vessels. The announcement was made jointly by Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Jonas Store on August 31, and is valued for the UK at $13.5 billion. Ships for the Royal Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy are to be built to identical specifications, so that in future logistic chains can be unified, joint crew training conducted and crews exchanged between ships. The decision comes ahead of the announcement of a new UK-Norway defense agreement, and builds on a particularly close naval relationship dating from the Second World War and continued through the Cold War. Royal Marines train annually in Norway to defend the far northern region, which borders Russia, and the HMS Prince of Wales (R09) carrier strike group on its deployment to the Pacific has been supported by the Norwegian Nansen Class frigate HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F311) and the logistic vessel HNoMS Maud (A530). The primary task for the Norwegian Type 26s will be anti-submarine warfare. The weapons fits remain to be fixed, and will no doubt be adjusted for the ships destined for both navies to take into account the strength of Norwegian missile manufacturers such as Kongsberg. The frigates will have hangars to integrate an anti-submarine warfare helicopter into the ship’s surveillance and attack capability. BAE’s Type 26 won out against stiff competition from Naval Group’s FDI, Germany’s F-127 and the American Constellation Class. The Type 26 has also been ordered for domestic manufacture by Australia (six Hunter Class ships) and Canada (fifteen River Class ships).",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02
UK Denies the Royal Navy Cannot Meet Operational Tasking,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-denies-the-royal-navy-cannot-meet-operational-tasking,,31/08/2025 21:10:00,,"Information from multiple sources suggests that the Royal Navy is now unable to meet commitments in several important areas, contrary to UK Ministry of Defence insistence that it is continuing to meet its operational tasking. A pattern of over-reliance on allies for support in order to maintain basic operational capabilities is apparent in a number of areas. For political reasons the Ministry appears unwilling to acknowledge the difficulties. But the problems are now so widespread that the collapse in capability has become glaringly obvious, and all too embarrassing for friends and allies to mention. The state of affairs is primarily a responsibility of British governments over many years who have shrunk the defense budget and delayed shipbuilding decisions, such that vessels are going out of service before new ships are delivered. At the same time, insufficient numbers of ships are being built to meet operational tasking, and the situation is compounded by a crisis in recruitment and retention. The issues are affecting operational capability across the whole fleet, and are not restricted to discreet capability areas. In the Indo-Pacific, HMS Prince of Wales (R09) continues its long-range deployment. But the Royal Navy is only fielding two of its protective escorts, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless (D33) and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond (F239), the others being provided by a changing cast of ships from Norway, Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. For half of its deployment, the Carrier Strike Group has relied on a Norwegian replenishment ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary being unable to field RFA Tidespring (A136) for the entire cruise. Meanwhile on deck, the carrier is only supporting two squadrons of F-35s, half the number it was designed to carry. Much smaller flattops, for example in the Italian Navy, carry similar numbers of aircraft. Of six Type 45 destroyers, only two are operational, with HMS Daring (D32) about to return to service after a refit lasting over 3,000 days. The eight remaining Type 23 frigates are 30 years old, kept operational only with great difficulty, amongst them HMS Lancaster (F229), rumored likely to be withdrawn from Bahrain this year without replacement. The Type 23s are being replaced by Type 26s, with HMS Glasgow due in service in 2028, and Type 31s, with HMS Venturer due in service by 2027. Even if there are no shipbuilding delays, in 2026 and 2027 the Royal Navy risks being down to less than five frigates, all of dubious serviceability. It is also possible that the Norwegian order for five Type 26 frigates announced on August 31 could delay delivery of some of the eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy through the reallocation of production slots. Underwater, delays in ordering new nuclear ballistic missile submarines mean that the Vanguard Class boats are suffering prolonged unserviceability. The need to always have one ‘bomber’ at sea has meant that three-month deployments are frequently extended, in one case in 2023 to six months. Prolonged deployments generate a whole series of problems, such as crew mental health and retention issues, and inevitably systems on board either fail or scheduled maintenance is missed, risky events in nuclear submarines. The consequences of running the Vanguard boats well beyond their design life will persist until at least the early 2030s, when new Dreadnought Class submarines currently being built start coming into service. The situation with attack submarines is equally dire. The last Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Triumph (S93) was decommissioned in July. Of seven Astute Class submarines to be built, five are commissioned, but only one is believed to be operational, probably committed to protecting the on-station nuclear ballistic submarine at sea. None is available to counter the still-powerful Russian submarine force elsewhere, which probably explains why a recent Russian submarine alarm in the northern Norwegian Sea had to be covered at huge cost by P8 Poseidon aircraft instead. In support of the fleet at sea, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is suffering a manning crisis, and can probably only put four ships to sea. The only healthy component of the fleet appears to be the offshore patrol vessels of the River Class, five of which are deployed to maintain the historic Royal Navy global presence, albeit with their limited firepower. The vessels cover for the shortage of destroyers and frigates - but without any anti-aircraft or anti-submarine capability. Royal Thai Navy versions of the same River Class design have a 76mm gun and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Omani versions have a 76mm gun and Exocet missiles, but the Royal Navy ships for cost reasons only have a 30mm Bushmaster cannon. For the next few years, until ships under construction come into service, Royal Navy planners will be praying that no operational emergencies arise - because so few ships are available to meet contingencies. It will be a struggle to maintain the underwater nuclear deterrent; there will be a single minesweeper in the Gulf to handle inevitable crises; issues generated by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine continue. But all the while, threats multiply and the seriousness of the lack of capability goes unrecognized.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 21:28:02

The training vessel ARC Gloria was preparing to arrive at Barranquilla, Colombia on Sunday, and was engaged in making preparations for the ship's upcoming training cruise. During the transit, as the ship was maneuvering to enter port, cabin boy Julian Fernando Condia Bello fell into the Magdalena River. According to local RCN Noticias, Bello was selected to climb the mainmast of the ship during the arrival ritual, likely as part of the common training-ship practice of having cadets go aloft and clip in while entering and exiting port. Bello reportedly lost control, fell several meters, hit a railing and went into the river, school official Javier Rubio told RCN. Bello would have performed the same climb safely many times during training. The causes of the man-overboard incident are under review. The ship's MOB procedures were activated, and search assets from Colombia's coast guard and navy responded to the scene to assist. River conditions on the Magdalena made the response effort challenging, according to local media.

IMO Secretary-General Pays Official Visit to the Panama Maritime Authority,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/imo-secretary-general-pays-official-visit-to-the-panama-maritime-authority,,02/09/2025 01:01:08,,"[By Panama Ship Registry] Arsenio Domínguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), carried out an official visit to the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) as part of his first mission to the country since taking office in January 2024. He was welcomed by Luis Roquebert, Administrator of the PMA, together with the institution’s directors and deputy directors. “I am delighted to be here. This is an institution that I hold very close to my heart, having worked here for more than 20 years,” Domínguez remarked. The highlight of the visit was the forum “Empowering Women in the Maritime Sector: A Call to Action on Training, Visibility, and Recognition for Sustainable Development.” The event emphasized the importance of continuing to expand women’s participation in an industry long dominated by men. Beyond training and leadership opportunities, the forum stressed the need to highlight women’s contributions and to ensure fair conditions across the maritime field—a sector that plays a pivotal role in the global economy. Both the IMO and PMA agreed that advancing gender equality is key to driving sustainability, innovation, and competitiveness in international shipping. Alongside the Secretary-General, the panel included Rina Berrocal, Deputy General Director of the Merchant Marine; Marta Aparicio, The General Director of Public Registry of Ship Ownership; and Pilar Castillo, Vice President of the Panama Maritime Chamber. “I greatly valued hearing the perspectives and initiatives being put forward, as well as the commitment to strengthening and showcasing the efficiency of the world’s largest ship registry by number of flagged vessels,” Domínguez noted at the close of the event. This visit forms part of a broader agenda led by the IMO Secretary-General in Panama, which includes high-level meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the PMA, the Panama Canal Authority, the International Maritime University of Panama, and various maritime industry associations—pushing forward the priority issues of his mandate.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 04:41:00
Italian Dockers to Halt Israel-Bound Cargo if Gaza Aid is Blocked,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-dockers-to-halt-israel-bound-cargo-if-gaza-aid-is-blocked,,02/09/2025 00:52:15,,"One of Italy's longshore union has threatened to shut down all outbound cargo shipments to Israel if the latest planned protest flotilla to Gaza gets stopped by the Israeli Navy's decades-long blockade. All seven previous seaborne aid attempts have been interdicted, most by Israeli commandos in international waters. The new flotilla is the fourth so far this year alone, and has just departed Barcelona with a fleet of 50 vessels (of varying sizes) and about 300 personnel in total. The operation has significant support in parts of Europe: in Genoa, local citizens put together an aid package of hundreds of tonnes of food and goods, supported with a $1.2 million donation from the populist Five Star Movement. The city's mayor also joined a march on Saturday to show solidarity with the flotilla's activists, and Genova Today estimated the size of the crowd at the nighttime march at about 40,000 people. ""I wanted to participate in the torchlight procession wearing the tricolor sash because I truly want to represent all of Genoa and its extraordinary solidarity and humanity,"" said mayor Silvia Salis, expressing her pride in her city. The sentiment extends to Italy's longshore unions, including Unione Sindacale di Base Confederazione Nazionale (USB), a nationwide union with branches in every industry. ""These boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza [in two weeks]. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe [for Israeli cargo],"" said a docker spokesmand for the union USB. ""Not a single nail will leave anymore."" The aid flotilla will rally at a port in Tunisia on September 4, then head onwards to Gaza en masse. Weather delays have reportedly set it back, but it should arrive in mid-September. Israel's government has denounced the flotilla: sources close to Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told local media that the plan is to detain the activist crewmembers in ""terrorist-level"" jail cells for weeks, then seize their boats for use by Israeli police. The flotilla's departure coincides with the release of a new assessment from the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), the world's largest professional association of its kind. The IAGS has concluded that Israel's ongoing operation in Gaza meets the UN treaty definition of genocide, based on Israeli officials' statements and the widely-reported events on the ground. Israel's government has dismissed IAGS' conclusion.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 04:41:00
China’s Dongfang Electric Hoists 26 MW Offshore Wind Turbine for Testing,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-dongfang-electric-hoists-26-mw-offshore-wind-turbine-for-testing,,02/09/2025 00:10:02,,"Dongfang Electric Wind Power completed the hoisting of the 26 MW offshore wind turbine for testing on August 29 as the industry races forward with the huge next generation of turbines. It is one of several large offshore wind turbines currently in design or testing to break the 20 MW barrier and continues China’s emergence as the leader in the technology. Western companies have generally stopped efforts at turbines above 18 MW, ceding the advancements to the Chinese. Mingyang Electric showed off its 20 MW turbine a year ago, as well as unveiling its efforts at a 26 MW giant. Dongfang previewed its 26 MW model last October, displaying the nacelle. The first unit was installed in Dongying, a city in northern Shandong province. The company reports there were large challenges to overcome, including difficulties with aerodynamics and structural coupling. The unit consists of over 30,000 components and is designed for medium to high-speed wind areas. It says it is suited for wind speeds above approximately 18 mph (8 meters per second). Nacelle for the massive unit being raised into position (Dongfang) The new unit is 31 percent larger than the 18 MW units and stands with its hub over 600 feet above the water level. It is reported to have a diameter of 310 meters (over 1,000 feet) with blades that are approximately 153 meters (502 feet) in length. Each rotation of the unit generates 62 kilowatt hours of electricity, and at average wind speeds of 22 mph, a single unit can produce 100 million kilowatt-hours annually. They report the design is also capable of withstanding a super typhoon with wind speeds of over 115 mph. It employs a third-generation fully integrated semi-direct drive technology that combines the shaft system, gearbox, and generator. It is also fully sealed to prevent salt spray corrosion and incorporates internal and external cooling systems. Critically, they highlight that the control systems and key components are all domestically made. Dongfang reports the unit is suited for operation in the 20 to 26 MW range. China, however, is yet to commercialize its largest wind turbines. Last December, Mingyang shut down tests on its 20 MW unit, acknowledging that two blades had fractured due to what were called “extreme, abnormal conditions,” according to Recharge News. China is believed to have reached 40 GW of installed offshore wind energy capacity, far ahead of any other nation. While the domestic market is booming, its manufacturers are also anxious to break into the Western market.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 04:41:00
ITF Warns Abandoned Tanker Crew is Caught in Sanctions on Illicit Oil Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/itf-warns-abandoned-tanker-crew-is-caught-in-sanctions-on-illicit-oil-trade,,01/09/2025 23:07:09,,"The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) is calling attention to the fate of 19 seafarers abandoned on a sanctioned product tanker that has been lying off the UAE for months. The organization has been warning that seafarer abandonment is on track for its worst year, but the situation of the Global Peace (6,191 dwt) is compounded by the fact that the tanker was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in April. The ship has been in the anchorage off Al Hamriyah since approximately February. The ITF points out that there are 17 Indian nationals aboard, along with one crewmember from Bangladesh and one from Ukraine. They have been aboard for as much as 15 months, well above the 11-month maximum in the Maritime Labour Convention. Complicating this case are the U.S. sanctions imposed against the UAE-based companies Prime Tankers and Glory International in April 2025 as part of the U.S.’s latest moves against the Iranian oil trade. The U.S. designated Indian national Jugwinder Singh Brar, who it said owns multiple shipping companies with a fleet of nearly 30 vessels, many of which operate as part of Iran’s “shadow fleet.” Brar, a ship captain, the U.S. said, had assembled a fleet mostly of Handysize tankers that were operating in coastal waters. It said he was conducting ship-to-ship transfers and blending oil and products from “shadow fleet” vessels, smugglers, and fishing vessels, and selling the products illegally to fund Iran. “This is a shocking case of abandonment that shines a light on how seafarers can be unseen victims of the illicit oil trade – it’s imperative that the UAE’s maritime authorities act now to save these seafarers and put an end to their ordeal,” said ITF Inspectorate Coordinator, Steve Trowsdale. The Global Peace, a product tanker built in 2010, appeared to have been acquired in 2021 for this trade. Its last known flag was the Cook Islands, but it currently has no known flag or insurance. ITF reports it has filed reports and listed the vessel in the joint abandonment database of the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. ITF has warned that as of August, there were 2,648 cases of seafarer abandonment recorded across 259 vessels compared to 3,133 seafarers abandoned in all of 2024. That was up 87 percent from 2023. It says the Middle East is the current hotspot for abandonment, with 32 vessels abandoned in the UAE in the first eight months of 2025. They note that the Global Peace crew’s right to repatriation has been ignored. They also report that the seafarers’ contracts refer to “fictitious ITF collective bargaining agreements.” They are calling on the UAE authorities and others to intervene.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 04:41:00

On August 30, GUR first-person view drones hit the Russian airbase in Gvardiyske, not far from Simferopol, damaging two Mi-8 transport helicopters. Each is valued at about $20-30 million, GUR said. An FPV drone attack also hit a Russian tug in Sevastopol's bay, illustrating why the Black Sea Fleet has evacuated its more valuable warships to the relative safety of Novorossiysk, far to the east. The tug was likely the assist tug BUK-2190, a RAL RAscal-2000 design licensed and built at Pella Shipyard in Leningrad in 2018. GUR said that the drone strike on the tug was carried out by military divers, ""for whose training significant financial and time resources are spent.""

Disney Adventure Cruise Ship Departs Wismar for Trials,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/disney-adventure-cruise-ship-departs-wismar-for-trials,,01/09/2025 21:34:46,,"Disney’s newest cruise ship and the eleventh largest in the cruise industry departed Wismar, Germany, on the evening of September 1, for sea trials. It marks several firsts as Disney will be the third cruise line to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, while also bringing to a close the construction in Wismar, which was marked by the financial collapse of Genting Hong Kong and the bankruptcy of the builder MV Werften. The departure of the Disney Adventure was delayed, with reports that it had been planned for Saturday and then pushed back first to Sunday and finally to Monday. The German media outlet NDR reports there were concerns over the water level in the Bay of Wismar, which is currently low, and winds due to the size and height of the ship at nearly 70 meters (230 feet). The ship got underway at around 1830 on September 1, with NDR reporting the harbor had been closed to all other ships and boats. A flotilla of tugs and harbor boats was on hand to assist the massive 1,122-foot (342-meter) vessel as it pushed off the fitting-out dock where it had been since April. It moved forward slowly and then pivoted with the assistance of tugs and its bow thrusters. The construction scaffolds still remain around the vessel's funnels. Due to the low water level, the ship will be making a stop at Mukran, Germany, on Rügen Island. There, it will refill its fresh water tanks and take on final supplies before heading into the North Sea for trials. The ship will then proceed to Bremerhaven after the trials to complete fitting out and is scheduled for a handover to Disney Cruise Line around the end of the month. Disney Adventure departing Wismar, Germany (NDR live broadcast) At 206,500 gross tons, the Disney Adventure is part of the emerging group of cruise ships exceeding the 200,000 GT mark and follows only Royal Caribbean International’s Icon and Oasis class and MSC Cruises’ World class in size. Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival have ordered similarly large cruise ships, which will begin delivery late in the decade. Disney acquired the ship from the bankruptcy of MV Werften and employed Meyer Werft to complete the construction at the shipyard in Wismar. The yard itself has been sold to TKMS for naval construction. Work on the ship began in 2018 for Genting Hong Kong’s Dream Cruises, known as Global One and named Global Dream. Designed for the Asian cruise market, the ship was going to have accommodations for approximately 9,500 passengers and over 2,000 crew. MV Werften filed for bankruptcy in January 2022. A planned sister ship was scrapped before assembly began. Disney redesigned the ship in keeping with its brand and experiences. Passenger capacity is now reported at approximately 6,700 and 2,300 crew. The ship was finally emerged from the building hall in April. Areas of the ship, such as a large casino, were reworked, and decor was created in the Disney style. Some features, including a roller coaster amusement, have been retained from the original design. Disney scheduled the ship to operate short cruises from Singapore year-round starting in mid-December. It is part of a large expansion of the cruise line. Late this year, the company will also add a cruise ship to its U.S.-based operations, the Disney Destiny, which was recently floated out at Meyer’s yard in Papenburg, Germany. Work has begun on another cruise ship at Papenburg, and Disney has ordered three additional ships, also to be built by Meyer. The operator of the Disney Tokyo Resort has also ordered its first cruise ship. Disney launched the cruise line in 1998 with a ship called Disney Magic. Today, the company operates six cruise ships with the operation reported to be one of the most profitable portions of the Disney corporation.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 04:41:00

Royal Navy Uses Drone Deliveries for STS Transfers for the First Time,https://maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-uses-drone-deliveries-for-sts-transfers-for-the-first-time,,02/09/2025 05:05:22,,"The Royal Navy carrier HMS Prince of Wales has debuted the service's first operational use of cargo drones for ship to ship transfers while on deployment to the Indo-Pacific. Prince of Wales and her crew used a Malloy T-150 quadcopter drone to transfer goods from the carrier to the destroyer HMS Dauntless, eliminating the need to use a helicopter or small craft for small-package flights. The drone flew a short one-mile transit from one ship to the other, and a crew aboard Dauntless guided it in for each landing. ""This is a key milestone for the trial, achieved by all the hard work that everyone has put in. I’m proud to have achieved this first for the Royal Navy and excited to progress further over the duration of the deployment,"" said Lieutenant Matt Parfitt, 700X Pioneer Flight Commander. The service has been experimenting with drone delivery services for a long time. Five years ago, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines began testing the Malloy T-150 for shoreside ammunition drops and combat supply deliveries during amphibious assault exercises, and also began work on testing the larger T-400 for bigger payloads. In 2023, a Royal Navy team trialed a much larger fixed-wing cargo drone for shore-to-carrier deliveries, the W Autonomous Systems HCMC, which has a payload of 100 kilos and a range of more than 850 nautical miles. The Malloy T-150 fills a sweet spot for small ship-to-ship transfers, and does not require a big deck for landing on each end of the trip. ""This milestone in the Malloy trials is a step toward the vision of a fully integrated hybrid carrier air wing. By taking some of the logistics burden, Malloy will allow our naval helicopters to concentrate on their core outputs,"" said Captain Colin McGannity, Commander Air Group, UK Carrier Strike Group. ""The really exciting bit is that we then plan to incorporate these lessons to be able to use UAVs for many other roles, including options for warfighting.""",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
China is Set to Unveil a Full Set of New Hypersonic Missiles,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-is-set-to-unveil-a-full-set-of-new-hypersonic-missiles,,02/09/2025 04:48:59,,"China is set to unveil its new hypersonic anti-ship missile at a parade in Beijing to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The YJ-17 has previously been kept under wraps. The YJ-17, from the Eagle Strike missile family, is reported to be able to reach Mach 8, or over 6,000 mph, and to be able to hit targets at a range of 750 miles. It is believed to have an evasive maneuver capability in its terminal flight phase, and can be vertically-launched from ships. The previously unseen YJ-17 has been seen alongside a number of other new recently introduced missiles in the mounting areas in Beijing where Wednesday’s parade is being rehearsed. These include the YJ-19 and YJ-20, both hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile, with the YJ-19 capable of being fired from ships. Various new missiles (ship UVLS launch?) confirmed, my 2c on roles: - YJ-15, ramjet compact supersonic? - YJ-17, waverider hypersonic glide? - YJ-19, ?maybe scramjet hypersonic? - YJ-20, biconical hypersonic/aeroballistic? Possibly seen before from 055.. Via REautomaton, SDF pic.twitter.com/9061QDAi09 The YJ-17 missile in particular - when operational on board Chinese ships - will be a new threat to US carriers operating in the Pacific, which the US Navy is seeking to counter by introducing new missile systems of its own. The AGM-158C LRASM long-range cruise missiles can be launched from carrier-borne aircraft. Block V Maritime Strike Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of over 1,000 miles are programmed to be operationally-ready aboard US destroyers by the end of this month. Both the US Navy and the Air Force are also engaged in a rapid procurement project known as MACE to acquire a cheaper and longer ranged air-launched missile, capable of being launched from stealth aircraft. No doubt the effectiveness of US defensive anti-missile systems will also need to be reevaluated to determine if they are capable of dealing with the hypersonic closing speed of the YJ-17. Also part of the strategy to counter the developing threat is the use of forward islands in the western Pacific, from which the US Marine Indo-Pacific Long Range Fires Battalion can launch SM-6 based Typhon missiles, a tactic rehearsed during the recent Exercise Talisman Sabre in Northern Australia. On the basis of equipment seen parked up for rehearsals, the 80th anniversary parade is likely to mark an uprating on China’s part of its aggressive stance towards the United States, Japan and Taiwan, probably also to be reflected in the speech which will be made by Chinese leader President Xi Jinping during the parade. Also attending the parade will be Russia’s President Putin and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. As a political event, the parade will mark the revival of President Xi’s ascendancy, after a period when it was thought that internal opposition to his martial leanings had diminished his standing. A meeting of the Shanghai Co-operation Organization preceded the parade, attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – a sign of an Indian-Chinese rapprochement amidst pressure from Washington - as well as leaders of two NATO countries, Recep Erdogan of Turkey and Robert Fico of Slovakia.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07

The training vessel ARC Gloria was preparing to arrive at Barranquilla, Colombia on Sunday, and was engaged in making preparations for the ship's upcoming training cruise. During the transit, as the ship was maneuvering to enter port, cabin boy Julian Fernando Condia Bello fell into the Magdalena River. According to local RCN Noticias, Bello was selected to climb the mainmast of the ship during the arrival ritual, likely as part of the common training-ship practice of having cadets go aloft and clip in while entering and exiting port. Bello reportedly lost control, fell several meters, hit a railing and went into the river, school official Javier Rubio told RCN. Bello would have performed the same climb safely many times during training. The causes of the man-overboard incident are under review. The ship's MOB procedures were activated, and search assets from Colombia's coast guard and navy responded to the scene to assist. River conditions on the Magdalena made the response effort challenging, according to local media.

IMO Secretary-General Pays Official Visit to the Panama Maritime Authority,https://maritime-executive.com/article/imo-secretary-general-pays-official-visit-to-the-panama-maritime-authority,,02/09/2025 01:01:08,,"[By Panama Ship Registry] Arsenio Domínguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), carried out an official visit to the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) as part of his first mission to the country since taking office in January 2024. He was welcomed by Luis Roquebert, Administrator of the PMA, together with the institution’s directors and deputy directors. “I am delighted to be here. This is an institution that I hold very close to my heart, having worked here for more than 20 years,” Domínguez remarked. The highlight of the visit was the forum “Empowering Women in the Maritime Sector: A Call to Action on Training, Visibility, and Recognition for Sustainable Development.” The event emphasized the importance of continuing to expand women’s participation in an industry long dominated by men. Beyond training and leadership opportunities, the forum stressed the need to highlight women’s contributions and to ensure fair conditions across the maritime field—a sector that plays a pivotal role in the global economy. Both the IMO and PMA agreed that advancing gender equality is key to driving sustainability, innovation, and competitiveness in international shipping. Alongside the Secretary-General, the panel included Rina Berrocal, Deputy General Director of the Merchant Marine; Marta Aparicio, The General Director of Public Registry of Ship Ownership; and Pilar Castillo, Vice President of the Panama Maritime Chamber. “I greatly valued hearing the perspectives and initiatives being put forward, as well as the commitment to strengthening and showcasing the efficiency of the world’s largest ship registry by number of flagged vessels,” Domínguez noted at the close of the event. This visit forms part of a broader agenda led by the IMO Secretary-General in Panama, which includes high-level meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the PMA, the Panama Canal Authority, the International Maritime University of Panama, and various maritime industry associations—pushing forward the priority issues of his mandate.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
Italian Dockers to Halt Israel-Bound Cargo if Gaza Aid is Blocked,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-dockers-to-halt-israel-bound-cargo-if-gaza-aid-is-blocked,,02/09/2025 00:52:15,,"One of Italy's longshore union has threatened to shut down all outbound cargo shipments to Israel if the latest planned protest flotilla to Gaza gets stopped by the Israeli Navy's decades-long blockade. All seven previous seaborne aid attempts have been interdicted, most by Israeli commandos in international waters. The new flotilla is the fourth so far this year alone, and has just departed Barcelona with a fleet of 50 vessels (of varying sizes) and about 300 personnel in total. The operation has significant support in parts of Europe: in Genoa, local citizens put together an aid package of hundreds of tonnes of food and goods, supported with a $1.2 million donation from the populist Five Star Movement. The city's mayor also joined a march on Saturday to show solidarity with the flotilla's activists, and Genova Today estimated the size of the crowd at the nighttime march at about 40,000 people. ""I wanted to participate in the torchlight procession wearing the tricolor sash because I truly want to represent all of Genoa and its extraordinary solidarity and humanity,"" said mayor Silvia Salis, expressing her pride in her city. The sentiment extends to Italy's longshore unions, including Unione Sindacale di Base Confederazione Nazionale (USB), a nationwide union with branches in every industry. ""These boats will arrive near the coast of Gaza [in two weeks]. If we lose contact with our boats, with our comrades, even for just 20 minutes, we will shut down all of Europe [for Israeli cargo],"" said a docker spokesmand for the union USB. ""Not a single nail will leave anymore."" The aid flotilla will rally at a port in Tunisia on September 4, then head onwards to Gaza en masse. Weather delays have reportedly set it back, but it should arrive in mid-September. Israel's government has denounced the flotilla: sources close to Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told local media that the plan is to detain the activist crewmembers in ""terrorist-level"" jail cells for weeks, then seize their boats for use by Israeli police. The flotilla's departure coincides with the release of a new assessment from the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), the world's largest professional association of its kind. The IAGS has concluded that Israel's ongoing operation in Gaza meets the UN treaty definition of genocide, based on Israeli officials' statements and the widely-reported events on the ground. Israel's government has dismissed IAGS' conclusion.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
China’s Dongfang Electric Hoists 26 MW Offshore Wind Turbine for Testing,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-dongfang-electric-hoists-26-mw-offshore-wind-turbine-for-testing,,02/09/2025 00:10:02,,"Dongfang Electric Wind Power completed the hoisting of the 26 MW offshore wind turbine for testing on August 29 as the industry races forward with the huge next generation of turbines. It is one of several large offshore wind turbines currently in design or testing to break the 20 MW barrier and continues China’s emergence as the leader in the technology. Western companies have generally stopped efforts at turbines above 18 MW, ceding the advancements to the Chinese. Mingyang Electric showed off its 20 MW turbine a year ago, as well as unveiling its efforts at a 26 MW giant. Dongfang previewed its 26 MW model last October, displaying the nacelle. The first unit was installed in Dongying, a city in northern Shandong province. The company reports there were large challenges to overcome, including difficulties with aerodynamics and structural coupling. The unit consists of over 30,000 components and is designed for medium to high-speed wind areas. It says it is suited for wind speeds above approximately 18 mph (8 meters per second). Nacelle for the massive unit being raised into position (Dongfang) The new unit is 31 percent larger than the 18 MW units and stands with its hub over 600 feet above the water level. It is reported to have a diameter of 310 meters (over 1,000 feet) with blades that are approximately 153 meters (502 feet) in length. Each rotation of the unit generates 62 kilowatt hours of electricity, and at average wind speeds of 22 mph, a single unit can produce 100 million kilowatt-hours annually. They report the design is also capable of withstanding a super typhoon with wind speeds of over 115 mph. It employs a third-generation fully integrated semi-direct drive technology that combines the shaft system, gearbox, and generator. It is also fully sealed to prevent salt spray corrosion and incorporates internal and external cooling systems. Critically, they highlight that the control systems and key components are all domestically made. Dongfang reports the unit is suited for operation in the 20 to 26 MW range. China, however, is yet to commercialize its largest wind turbines. Last December, Mingyang shut down tests on its 20 MW unit, acknowledging that two blades had fractured due to what were called “extreme, abnormal conditions,” according to Recharge News. China is believed to have reached 40 GW of installed offshore wind energy capacity, far ahead of any other nation. While the domestic market is booming, its manufacturers are also anxious to break into the Western market.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
ITF Warns Abandoned Tanker Crew is Caught in Sanctions on Illicit Oil Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/itf-warns-abandoned-tanker-crew-is-caught-in-sanctions-on-illicit-oil-trade,,01/09/2025 23:07:09,,"The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) is calling attention to the fate of 19 seafarers abandoned on a sanctioned product tanker that has been lying off the UAE for months. The organization has been warning that seafarer abandonment is on track for its worst year, but the situation of the Global Peace (6,191 dwt) is compounded by the fact that the tanker was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in April. The ship has been in the anchorage off Al Hamriyah since approximately February. The ITF points out that there are 17 Indian nationals aboard, along with one crewmember from Bangladesh and one from Ukraine. They have been aboard for as much as 15 months, well above the 11-month maximum in the Maritime Labour Convention. Complicating this case are the U.S. sanctions imposed against the UAE-based companies Prime Tankers and Glory International in April 2025 as part of the U.S.’s latest moves against the Iranian oil trade. The U.S. designated Indian national Jugwinder Singh Brar, who it said owns multiple shipping companies with a fleet of nearly 30 vessels, many of which operate as part of Iran’s “shadow fleet.” Brar, a ship captain, the U.S. said, had assembled a fleet mostly of Handysize tankers that were operating in coastal waters. It said he was conducting ship-to-ship transfers and blending oil and products from “shadow fleet” vessels, smugglers, and fishing vessels, and selling the products illegally to fund Iran. “This is a shocking case of abandonment that shines a light on how seafarers can be unseen victims of the illicit oil trade – it’s imperative that the UAE’s maritime authorities act now to save these seafarers and put an end to their ordeal,” said ITF Inspectorate Coordinator, Steve Trowsdale. The Global Peace, a product tanker built in 2010, appeared to have been acquired in 2021 for this trade. Its last known flag was the Cook Islands, but it currently has no known flag or insurance. ITF reports it has filed reports and listed the vessel in the joint abandonment database of the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. ITF has warned that as of August, there were 2,648 cases of seafarer abandonment recorded across 259 vessels compared to 3,133 seafarers abandoned in all of 2024. That was up 87 percent from 2023. It says the Middle East is the current hotspot for abandonment, with 32 vessels abandoned in the UAE in the first eight months of 2025. They note that the Global Peace crew’s right to repatriation has been ignored. They also report that the seafarers’ contracts refer to “fictitious ITF collective bargaining agreements.” They are calling on the UAE authorities and others to intervene.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07

On August 30, GUR first-person view drones hit the Russian airbase in Gvardiyske, not far from Simferopol, damaging two Mi-8 transport helicopters. Each is valued at about $20-30 million, GUR said. An FPV drone attack also hit a Russian tug in Sevastopol's bay, illustrating why the Black Sea Fleet has evacuated its more valuable warships to the relative safety of Novorossiysk, far to the east. The tug was likely the assist tug BUK-2190, a RAL RAscal-2000 design licensed and built at Pella Shipyard in Leningrad in 2018. GUR said that the drone strike on the tug was carried out by military divers, ""for whose training significant financial and time resources are spent.""

Disney Adventure Cruise Ship Departs Wismar for Trials,https://maritime-executive.com/article/disney-adventure-cruise-ship-departs-wismar-for-trials,,01/09/2025 21:34:46,,"Disney’s newest cruise ship and the eleventh largest in the cruise industry departed Wismar, Germany, on the evening of September 1, for sea trials. It marks several firsts as Disney will be the third cruise line to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, while also bringing to a close the construction in Wismar, which was marked by the financial collapse of Genting Hong Kong and the bankruptcy of the builder MV Werften. The departure of the Disney Adventure was delayed, with reports that it had been planned for Saturday and then pushed back first to Sunday and finally to Monday. The German media outlet NDR reports there were concerns over the water level in the Bay of Wismar, which is currently low, and winds due to the size and height of the ship at nearly 70 meters (230 feet). The ship got underway at around 1830 on September 1, with NDR reporting the harbor had been closed to all other ships and boats. A flotilla of tugs and harbor boats was on hand to assist the massive 1,122-foot (342-meter) vessel as it pushed off the fitting-out dock where it had been since April. It moved forward slowly and then pivoted with the assistance of tugs and its bow thrusters. The construction scaffolds still remain around the vessel's funnels. Due to the low water level, the ship will be making a stop at Mukran, Germany, on Rügen Island. There, it will refill its fresh water tanks and take on final supplies before heading into the North Sea for trials. The ship will then proceed to Bremerhaven after the trials to complete fitting out and is scheduled for a handover to Disney Cruise Line around the end of the month. Disney Adventure departing Wismar, Germany (NDR live broadcast) At 206,500 gross tons, the Disney Adventure is part of the emerging group of cruise ships exceeding the 200,000 GT mark and follows only Royal Caribbean International’s Icon and Oasis class and MSC Cruises’ World class in size. Norwegian Cruise Line and Carnival have ordered similarly large cruise ships, which will begin delivery late in the decade. Disney acquired the ship from the bankruptcy of MV Werften and employed Meyer Werft to complete the construction at the shipyard in Wismar. The yard itself has been sold to TKMS for naval construction. Work on the ship began in 2018 for Genting Hong Kong’s Dream Cruises, known as Global One and named Global Dream. Designed for the Asian cruise market, the ship was going to have accommodations for approximately 9,500 passengers and over 2,000 crew. MV Werften filed for bankruptcy in January 2022. A planned sister ship was scrapped before assembly began. Disney redesigned the ship in keeping with its brand and experiences. Passenger capacity is now reported at approximately 6,700 and 2,300 crew. The ship was finally emerged from the building hall in April. Areas of the ship, such as a large casino, were reworked, and decor was created in the Disney style. Some features, including a roller coaster amusement, have been retained from the original design. Disney scheduled the ship to operate short cruises from Singapore year-round starting in mid-December. It is part of a large expansion of the cruise line. Late this year, the company will also add a cruise ship to its U.S.-based operations, the Disney Destiny, which was recently floated out at Meyer’s yard in Papenburg, Germany. Work has begun on another cruise ship at Papenburg, and Disney has ordered three additional ships, also to be built by Meyer. The operator of the Disney Tokyo Resort has also ordered its first cruise ship. Disney launched the cruise line in 1998 with a ship called Disney Magic. Today, the company operates six cruise ships with the operation reported to be one of the most profitable portions of the Disney corporation.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
Bunker Tanker Collides with Bulker Off Singapore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bunker-tanker-operating-for-chevron-collides-with-bulker-off-singapore,,01/09/2025 20:50:03,,"The authorities were responding to a collision off Singapore on Monday, September 1, in which a bunker barge and a bulker made contact. The Maritime & Port Authority of Singapore is reporting that there was a small fuel spill that was expected to evaporate and break down in the environment, and that both vessels were stable. Few details were released after the Marine Dynamo (8,270 dwt) collided with the bulker Flag Gangos (56,526 dwt). The vessels were reported to be approximately 5 miles offshore in the western area near Tanah Merah. The collision was reported at 0925 local time, with the MPA saying that a patrol boat, spill response craft, and a drone were deployed. The master of Marine Dynamo reported that the vessel had spilled Marine Gas Oil (MGO) used for the barge’s propulsion. One crewmember aboard the vessel was also reported to have suffered bruises and sprains and was being treated onboard. The bulker involved in the collision, Flag Gagnos, Greek-owned and registered in Malta. The ship was heading for Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka. Marine Dynamo was built in 2023 as one of the two hybrid electric bunker barges for V-Bunkers (Vitol). The ship has an electric power system that made it possible to reduce from three to two the number of auxiliary engines installed. It has a 480 kWh energy storage system, which was expected to reduce fuel consumption by approximately 20 percent.

Cruise Industry Sues Hawaii Saying “Green Fee” is Unconstitutional,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cruise-industry-sues-hawaii-saying-green-fee-is-unconstitutional,,01/09/2025 19:22:56,,"The cruise industry has taken the unusual step of filing a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of a new Hawaiian law that they claim is unconstitutional and will impose unreasonable fees on cruise ships docking in the state. At issue is a new law known as the “Green Fee” enacted in Hawaii in May and due to go into effect on January 1, increasing the state tax on hotels and short-term rentals, and for the first time extending the tax to cruise ship passengers. The state government ratified the first-of-its-kind legislation this year, saying it would provide funding to deal with the impacts of climate change on its resources. It cited beach erosion and the devastating fire on Maui in 2023. Experts have predicted the new taxes could raise as much as $100 million annually. Hotel guests and short-term rentals have long been paying taxes in Hawaii. The new law increases the tax on those visitors from the current 10.25 percent, adding .75 percent for a total of 11 percent of their stay, with various exemptions. At the same time, the law imposes for the first time an 11 percent “Green Fee” on cruise ship passengers for the time their ship is docked in Hawaiian ports and also gives the local government the authority to collect an additional 3 percent surcharge. The trade group Cruise Lines International Association, along with several representatives of Hawaii businesses impacted by the cruise tax, filed suit in U.S. District Court for Hawaii on August 27, seeking an injunction to block the tax and reporting requirements. According to the suit, the “Green Fee” is a “blatant violation” of the U.S. Constitution, federal Rivers and Harbors regulations, and the principles of freedom of speech. The suit contends that U.S. federal legislation ensures that “navigable waters of the United States are a common resource, not one to be commandeered by individual states for their own parochial revenue-raising interests.” They assert that no other state has attempted this type of fee, which they allege will be used to fund the state’s treasury and fund green projects as opposed to being linked to services provided to the cruise ships. The suit highlights the regulations in the federal Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1884 as well as the “tonnage clause” in the U.S. Constitution. They write that Hawaii is violating federal statutory limits on the fees states may impose for the use of navigable waters. They also claim the tax is unfair because it lacks the exemptions provided for hotel and short-term rental guests and is disproportionate for cruise passengers compared to other entities related to tourism in the state. The suit also attacks a provision that requires the cruise ships to post notices about compliance with the fee onboard and include similar information in every advertisement for Hawaii-bound cruises. Since the fee is unconstitutional, they assert the notification is a violation of free speech. Cruises they report bring about 3000,000 tourists annually to Hawaii based on 2023 data. Hawaii government data shows that there were more than 9.6 million visitors to the state in 2023. In the suit, CLIA contends the additional fees will make Hawaii cruises far more expensive for families. They write it will add hundreds of dollars to the cost of popular cruise itineraries that dock in Hawaii’s ports. They suggest that families will forgo trips to Hawaii in favor of other destinations, also hurting the state’s broader economy and businesses in Hawaii that draw revenues from cruise passengers. The suit asks the court to enjoin the state from enforcing the new legislation. A hearing is scheduled for the end of October. The cruise industry has long been known to use its size to pressure destinations that impose taxes or other levies, but this is only the second time that CLIA has filed suit against a state. In 2016, CLIA Alaska sued Juneau, Alaska, as part of its fight with the state over head taxes. That suit also hinged on the “tonnage clause,” and in 2018, the U.S. District Court sided with CLIA that a tax could only be imposed for services that were being provided to the vessel. The following year, CLIA and Juneau reached a settlement in the case over the use of the passenger taxes. The cruise industry has been facing similar pressures internationally. Greece recently imposed new fees to deal with the impact on the most popular islands after many complained that the ports, such as Santorini and Mykonos, were being overrun by cruise passengers. Mexico also announced a large head tax, but later reached an agreement with the cruise industry for a more phased approach to the fees.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07
Video: Tugs Race to Secure Containership After Mooring Lines Break,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-tugs-race-to-secure-containership-after-mooring-lines-break,,01/09/2025 19:10:52,,"Images are appearing online showing the moments after a containership broke loose in Brazil’s second-largest port and was moving in the shipping channel. The emergency response team and tugs quickly responded to secure the ship with no damage in the Port of Itajal, south of São Paulo, Brazil. The containership Vincente Pinzon (57,881 dwt) was moored in the port on August 27 when it snapped its mooring lines first at the bow. The vessel began to swing into the busy Itajaí-Açu river before breaking its stern lines and starting to move down the channel. Port officials blamed the strong current in the river, which took control of the vessel. Built in 2014, the ship, which previously operated for Hamburg Sud, has a capacity of 4,848 TEU. It operates a coastal service for the shipping company Alianca Navegacao connecting Brazil’s ports. Port officials said the breakaway happened around 0650, and their emergency team quickly responded to the incident. Tugs can be seen scrambling to secure the 254-meter (833-foot) ship and then turning it 180 degrees and heading it back up the river, all without injuries or serious damage. The pilots were able to gain control of the vessel with the assistance of the tugs. Media reports highlight it was the second time in a matter of months that a similar situation occurred. In December 2024, another containership also broke free. Concern was raised because the ship came very close to the ferry terminal before it was able to be brought under control. The Port of Itajal is Brazil’s main southern facility serving the key industrial region in the south of the country. The port is slated for modernization and investments to increase efficiency as part of the country’s program to auction concessions in the first quarter of 2026. The initiative includes infrastructure work to allow the berthing of vessels up to 400 meters (1,312 feet) in length at Itajal, dredging the channel to increase the draft to 16 meters (52.5 feet).",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 09:32:07

Russian Authorities Detained Sanctioned Tanker for Unpaid Crew Wages,https://maritime-executive.com/article/russian-authorities-detained-sanctioned-tanker-for-unpaid-crew-wages,,02/09/2025 20:02:19,,"A shadow fleet tanker that is currently sanctioned in the West was reportedly detained by the Russian authorities in the port of Murmansk due to a range of issues, including unpaid crew wages, reports the Russian Seafarers’ Union. The crew of the vessel raised concerns to the union, which says it referred the matter to the Murmansk port captain’s office. The tanker named Unity (108,929 dwt) is typical of the shadow fleet. Built in 2009, it is reportedly being managed by a shipping company from the UAE. The ship is now showing a registry in Lesotho, having switched in August from Gambia. Databases show the vessel has changed names and flags four times since 2021, including twice in 2024 and briefly under the Russian flag from September 2024 to February 2025. The union reports the 20-person crew is due nearly $90,000 as of August 13 in back pay. They only received their pay for June on July 27, and further said that the crew that had been signed off had also not received pay. The crew is also seeking compensation for sailing through a pirate danger zone and fines for late payments. Concerns are being raised about the legal ownership of the vessel, saying that when its registry in Gambia expired on August 5, the vessel’s ownership was changed on the paperwork from Argo Tanker Group to Petroleum United FZCO. The concern is that some of the crew’s employment contracts are with Argo, and the insurance was also changed. “Sailors fear that since the vessel has indeed changed its flag and registry company, all contracts on board are invalid, and they will not be able to apply to the P&I if the shipowner is unable to fulfill contractual obligations regarding the payment of wages,” said Olga Ananyina of the Russian Seafarers’ Union. The port control inspection conducted in Murmansk on August 28 is reported to have confirmed numerous violations. The authorities detailed the vessel until the discrepancies were corrected. The AIS signal shows the vessel as underway on September 2, but it is suspect and could be spoofed. The tanker has been sanctioned by the EU and UK, as well as Australia, Canada, and Switzerland, for its involvement in the Russian oil trade. The union also reports that Argo Tanker Group, which is listed in databases with a mailing address in Moscow, was also cited by the authorities for failing to pay more than $130,000 to the crew of another tanker named Dignity. The 159,426 dwt tanker operates under the Russian flag, transporting oil from Murmansk, but so far has not been sanctioned. The Moscow Times reports a strong rise in late or unpaid wages across Russia. It cites government statistics that show the total amount due has doubled over the past year. As of the end of July, it was reported to be at nearly $13 million. The paper cited the high rate charged by the Central Bank as a key problem for businesses to take out loans to cover operating expenses.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 21:27:08
Oil Exports Resume After 14 Years from Syria’s Tartus Port,https://maritime-executive.com/article/oil-exports-resume-after-14-years-from-syria-s-tartus-port,,02/09/2025 18:38:29,,"The first cargo of Syrian crude oil to be exported from the port of Tartus since the Syrian civil war was lifted on September 1. The Greek-owned tanker Nissos Christiana (114,264 dwt), loaded 600,000 barrels of heavy crude oil according to the Syrian Ministry of Energy. The cargo has been purchased by BB Energy, a global oil-trading firm, for an unknown final customer. The vessel, which was built in 2015, is managed by Kyklades Maritime and registered in Greece. According to its AIS signal, it has yet to depart Syria, but the Ministry is calling it an important step in revitalizing the oil sector and broadening international cooperation. Given the volume of oil lifted, most if not all the crude must have come from oil fields in Rojava, the Kurdish-controlled territory in the north east of Syria controlled by the Democratic Union Party (PYD). The PYD as part of its reconciliation with the new government in Damascus permitted oil exports to recommence in February, although supply may have been disrupted recently by renewed tensions between the PYD and the government. In 2010, the last full year before production was disrupted, Syria exported a modest 380,000 barrels of oil per day. Shell had developed and operated the largest Syrian oil field in conjunction with government interests, but suspended production in 2011 when EU sanctions were imposed. The second-largest foreign operator was France’s Total, also government-tied. The revival of Tartus as a crude export terminal comes as DP World has signed an $800 million agreement with the Syrian government under which it will develop and manage the port. DP World replaced the previous Russian operator OAO Stroytransgaz who had operated the port since 2019. The Russian submarine Novorossky seems to be leaving the Med. Together with tug Jakob Grebelsky, the pair is now sailing NW in the central Mediterranean at 11–15 kts.#Russia https://t.co/nFA8blhdDs The Russian Navy appears to have finally closed its links with Tartus, previously the supply and maintenance base for its Mediterranean Flotilla. Earlier this month, without docking the Russian Kilo Class submarine RFS Novorossiksk (B261) was active off Tartus for several weeks, the last remnant of the Mediterranean Flotilla still operating in the Mediterranean. In an extraordinary reversal of fortunes, the open source analyst italmilradar has plotted what appears to be the imminent departure of the Novorossiksk and its accompanying Goryn Class tug Yakov Grebelskiy through the Straits of Gibraltar - which would mark the end of the permanent Russian presence in the Mediterranean - albeit further visits can be expected.",Maritime Executive,02/09/2025 21:27:08

In a significant and growing market for Gibdock, the Gibraltar-based ship repair yard has established itself as a trusted strategic partner to several major offshore players by consistently executing projects on time, within budget, and to the highest safety and quality standards. As part of an ongoing relationship with Boskalis, Gibdock has completed works on the trailing hopper suction dredger Gateway, the construction support vessel BOKA Southern Ocean, and the multipurpose construction vessel BOKA Fulmar in recent months. Other significant OSV projects this year include the repair of Subsea 7’s construction/flex-lay vessel Seven Pacific and the repair and renewal of Technip’s specialised rigid pipelay vessel Deep Blue. With Solstad’s anchor-handling tug supply vessel Normand Pacific currently in the yard for renewal, and many more projects in the pipeline for the year ahead, Gibdock’s outlook in the offshore support segment is strong. “Offshore majors trust Gibdock because of our track record in delivering safe, high-quality, and on-time services at good value,” commented John Barnard, Commercial Director, Gibdock. “We work closely with these companies to provide bespoke projects and conversions within a timeline that suits them. Due to the strong and growing demand for our OSV services, we encourage proactive engagement: interested parties should approach us early, even when projects are planned for two or three years out, so we can ensure availability and provide tailored input.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52

On Tuesday, the White House announced the elimination of 11 suspects who were allegedly transporting narcotics off the coast of Venezuela. ""The president is going to be on offense against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters. ""It destabilizes not just the country, but the entire Caribbean basin. These particular drugs were probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.""

The strike occurred in international waters, resulting in 11 fatalities. ""Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. The White House did not disclose if there were any survivors recovered for criminal prosecution, or if the drugs were retrieved from the scene of the interdiction. Historically, maritime smuggling intercepts have been handled by the U.S. Coast Guard using its law enforcement authority, with almost all suspects captured alive. The strike comes as the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are surging assets into the southern Caribbean. According to Reuters, seven warships are in the vicinity of Venezuela or are on their way, bringing a combined force of 4,500 sailors and marines with them. The Trump administration views the Venezuelan regime of dictator Nicolas Maduro as illegitimate, and the White House has repeatedly asserted links between Maduro, Venezuelan drug trafficking, and the ""Tren de Aragua"" gang (TDA). The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has reached the opposite conclusion: in April, ODNI's National Intelligence Council advised that Maduro's administration views Tren de Aragua as a threat, not a partner, and that the ""Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with [Tren de Aragua].""",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Everllence Breaks Ground on New Danish HQ,https://maritime-executive.com/article/everllence-breaks-ground-on-new-danish-hq,,03/09/2025 03:38:13,,"[By: Everllence] Everllence has held a groundbreaking ceremony in Roskilde, Denmark to mark the commencement of the building phase of its new Danish headquarters. Called ‘The Valley’, the development is a joint venture between Everllence and Volkswagen Immobilien, the Volkswagen Group’s real-estate division. The company states that its current base in Greater Copenhagen – and its Holeby, southern Denmark site – have given rise to many innovations that drive climate-neutral shipping, including such world-firsts as the high-pressure dual-fuel two-stroke engine, methanol-powered engines, as well as the first firing of a two-stroke engine fuelled by ammonia. However, the sites’ current facilities – particularly at its Copenhagen location – are outdated with major renovations otherwise looming. The decision to relocate is driven then by strategic necessity with The Valley offering space for growth, both in terms of workforce and production capacity, and in an industrial setting that facilitates the testing of new fuel-technologies while ensuring safer logistics. The ceremony was attended by members of the Everllence Executive Board and a number of prominent guests, including: Everllence CEO, Dr Uwe Lauber; Managing Director Volkswagen Immobilien, Hardy Brennecke; Everllence Head of Two-Stroke Business and Country Manager Denmark, Bjarne Foldager; and Mayor of Roskilde, Tomas Breddam. Lauber said: “Today’s event marks a historic milestone in Everllence’s journey. As we turn the first sod in this exciting venture, we are laying the foundation – not just for a new campus, but for a new chapter in our company’s history. Our current facilities in Denmark have served us well but were not built for the future we are envisaging. This location is purposely designed for excellence, tailored to the unique needs of our people, our technologies, and our decarbonisation aspirations. The future starts here – and it starts now.” Located on the site of a former gravel pit, The Valley campus lies 40 km west of Copenhagen and will comprise a 70,000 m2 complex of buildings including office space for at least 1,500 workstations, a teaching academy, meeting centre and an employee club. Construction by general contractor, DS Flexhal, will also see the building of a production unit and warehouse, as well as a research centre with testing facilities. Speaking on behalf of VW Immobilien, Brennecke said: “The traditional groundbreaking ceremony for ‘The Valley Campus’ marks the start of construction for a special real-estate project. Over the next few years, modern, sustainable office and production facilities, an academy, and meeting areas will be built on the approximately 175,000 m2 site. With this sustainable construction project, Everllence is underscoring its successful business development. We wish everyone involved in the project a thriving and accident-free construction period.” Foldager said: ”This project is also a strategic consolidation that brings together our teams from Copenhagen and Holeby, creating an environment where expertise meets collaboration, where two-stroke meets four-stroke – and with room to grow, free from the constraints of residential surroundings. Here, we can innovate safely, efficiently, and responsibly – especially as we work with new fuels like ammonia. Together, we are building more than a main location for Everllence in Denmark; we are building a legacy.”",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Panama and Classification Societies Review Regulations to Align Strategies,https://maritime-executive.com/article/panama-and-classification-societies-review-regulations-to-align-strategies,,03/09/2025 02:06:12,,"[By Panama Ship Registry] The Panama Maritime Authority (PMA), through the Directorate General of Merchant Marine (DGMM), held a roundtable with the International Association of Recognized Organizations (IARO) to review, update, and align Panama’s Ship Registry regulations with the demands of the global market. The meeting brought together PMA officials and leading classification societies within the IARO, marking a decisive step toward modernizing Panama’s ship registration regime. “We must see the Panamanian Registry as a single team. It’s not only the PMA’s responsibility, maritime lawyers and Recognized Organizations must also drive projects and new measures to strengthen competitiveness,” emphasized Ramón Franco, Director General of Merchant Marine. For his part, IARO President Santiago Torrijos Oro highlighted that cooperation with the PMA will bolster Panama’s flag on the international stage. “The measures may seem drastic, but they are necessary to remain one of the world’s most prestigious flags,” he stated. Discussions focused on key industry challenges, including maritime safety, environmental protection, and the need for a modern and transparent regulatory framework. These efforts aim to ensure that Panama maintains its global leadership while adapting to the evolving standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the growing demands of international trade. The IARO brings together classification societies recognized by the PMA to inspect and certify vessels, making their role vital in ensuring the continuous improvement of the Panamanian flag. Through this joint effort, Panama reaffirms its standing as a global leader in merchant shipping and strengthens international shipowners’ confidence in its flag.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Investment Firm Carlyle Buys Altera Infrastructure Group’s FPSO Business,https://maritime-executive.com/article/investment-firm-carlyle-buys-altera-infrastructure-group-s-fpso-business,,03/09/2025 01:40:45,,"Global investment firm Carlyle is jumping into the offshore energy sector reporting it has agreed to acquire the FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) business from Altera Infrastructure Group, a leading offshore energy infrastructure company owned by Brookfield Asset Management’s private equity business. The investment group with $465 billion of assets under management has decided to enter the business due to the strong opportunities. Altera currently has a fleet of six FPSOs deployed in Brazil, Dubai, and Cote d’Ivoire. It also has two FSOs operating off Cote d’Ivoire and in the Gulf of Thailand. “This is a rare opportunity to acquire an established and high-quality FPSO business with a strong management team, operating track record and long-term cashflows,” said Bob Maguire, Co-Head of Carlyle International Energy Partners (CIEP). “This portfolio benefits from long-term contracts, strong FPSO market fundamentals, and exposure to world-class operators which position it well for success.” It is part of continuing efforts that have been reshaping the business of UK-based Altera Infrastructure. It reorganized through the US bankruptcy proceeding in late 2022. At the end of last year, it sold its interests in Altera Shuttle Tankers, a fleet of 18 shuttle tankers in Brazil, Canada, and the North Sea, to Maistros Shiptrade, a company affiliated with the Angelicoussis Group. The business being acquired by Carlyle includes ownership of the FPSOs and the FSO (Floating Storage and Offloading), which are underpinned by long-term contracts with major oil and gas companies. The portfolio includes the Petrojarl Kong FPSO and FSO Yamoussoukro, deployed in the Ivory Coast with Eni, which represents the first net-zero emission upstream project in Africa, the Piranema FPSO, as well as 50 percent of the Altera&Ocyan joint-venture asset Pioneiro de Libra FPSO, deployed in Brazil with Petrobras. Additionally, the business has a strong pipeline of future growth and redeployment opportunities. Carlyle says it will support the Altera FPSO business through its sector-specific investment team. It promises available follow-on equity capital for accretive growth and M&A, building on the company’s track record in redeployments.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Coast Guard Awards Contract to Begin Overhaul at Base Seattle,https://maritime-executive.com/article/coast-guard-awards-contract-to-begin-overhaul-at-base-seattle,,03/09/2025 01:17:11,,"The U.S. Coast Guard has awarded a contract to start modernization works to prepare for homeporting its future Polar Security Cutters in Seattle. Whiting-Turner Contracting won an award worth about $140 million for the first phase of the project, to include construction of two large cutter berths and dredging of a slip to the depth required for the PSC hulls. The first phase (1A) will widen the slip between two berths, add upgraded utility installations, remove an existing building, and install waterfront stabilization structures. It will also see the renovation of Station Seattle's existing boathouse and small boat docks. After this phase and the next two are completed, Base Seattle will have four large cutter berths, enough to support a range of oceangoing vessels. In planning, the Coast Guard said that its preferred alternative is to acquire part of Terminal 46, just to the north of the base, and upgrade 1,000-plus feet of existing commercial wharfage to provide extra space for cutters. Seattle has been the home port for the service's medium and heavy icebreakers for years, and it benefits from the area's well-developed industrial base and the presence of a major shipyard nearby. It will continue to be the service's primary home port for icebreakers, with an exception for USCGC Storis, which will have a base of her own in Juneau. Coast Guard Base Seattle evolved organically as the service's needs grew in the region. After decades of berthing its cutters wherever there was space available along the commercial waterfront, the service acquired Piers 36 and 37 from the Army Corps of Engineers in 1966. That facility has been headquarters for Sector Puget Sound and Base Seattle ever since, and its infrastructure is aging. Base improvements have historically taken a back seat for the cash-strapped Coast Guard, which has long struggled to find funding to keep its shoreside infrastructure in working shape. After years of budget sequestration and deferred maintenance, the USCG received a major boost in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which provided a much-needed $4.4 billion for reconstructing shoreside facilities.

Trump Administration to Target SouthCoast Wind in War on Wind Power,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-to-target-southcoast-wind-in-war-on-wind-power,,03/09/2025 01:11:52,,"It was revealed in a court filing on Friday, August 29, that the Trump administration, through the Department of the Interior, plans to reconsider permits issued last year to the SouthCoast offshore wind project. It comes as the administration has sought to make good on Donald Trump’s opposition to “windmills” by issuing stop work orders, freezing new permits, reconsidering existing permits, and withdrawing tax credits and funding grants. The Department of Justice filed a motion in a suit brought by the Town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, appealing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December 2024 approval of South Coast Wind as the nation’s 11th commercial-scale offshore wind energy project. The suit alleges flaws in the permitting process, saying that BOEN violated federal environmental law by approving the project without requiring the developer to properly mitigate harm from the efforts. Nantucket says it gave the project’s developers multiple opportunities to address the island’s concerns prior to filing suit on March 27. It alleges the approval “creates a dangerous precedent” that allows fossil fuel developers the opportunity to also fast-track projects and avoid safeguards. They contend the suit is to reinforce environmental and preservation laws. The Department of Justice told the court on Friday that the suit “makes little sense” because it plans to formally move for reconsideration of the permit by September 18. It is the same tactic DOJ and the Trump administration reported it is taking for Maryland’s first offshore wind project, which was also approved in 2024. They plan to file the reconsideration effort against the permits for US Wind’s Maryland wind farm project by September 12. SouthCoast Wind is being developed by Ocean Wind North America, a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie. The project, which was then known as Mayflower Wind, won its lease in a December 2018 auction. The approved plan calls for the construction of up to 141 wind turbine generators and up to five offshore substation platforms with the potential to generate up to 2,400 MW. It would be located about 26 nautical miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 20 nm south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The Town’s opposition is part of its broader efforts against the wind industry. They contend that if all the proposed projects were developed, there would be an estimated 743 wind turbines located off Nantucket’s coastline. A total of nine wind farm sites have been designated for the area. The company filed a motion with the court opposing the government’s call for an extension while it pursues the effort to reconsider the permits. The motion says the effort is part of the government’s larger efforts to eliminate all offshore wind projects regardless of their impact. The federal government has unleashed efforts on all fronts, including the president’s executive order to review the industry and freeze permitting. They briefly stopped work on the Empire Wind project in New York before it started offshore work, and now have stopped Resolution Wind in Massachusetts, which is 80 percent installed. Grants for port projects to support the industry have now been withdrawn, and the administration said it was launching a review of the offshore wind industry on the grounds of national security concerns. The governors of five states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island) issued a joint statement on September 1, calling on the administration to uphold the permits that have already been issued for offshore wind projects. The states had previously filed suit against the administration over the president’s executive order to review the industry.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
U.S. Sanctions Efforts to Blend Iranian and Iraqi Oil to Avoid Restrictions,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-sanctions-efforts-to-blend-iranian-and-iraqi-oil-to-avoid-restrictions,,03/09/2025 00:09:41,,"US Sanctions Efforts to Blend Iranian and Iraqi Oil to Avoid Trade Restrictions The United States, through its sanctions program, is increasing the pressure on the Iranian oil trade and the efforts to obfuscate the origins of the oil by blending. New sanctions announced on September 2 by the U.S. the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) targeted the business network of a UAE-based businessman, Waleed al-Samarra’I, and nine Liberian-flagged tankers, which the U.S. says have generated millions of dollars in oil revenue. The network, the U.S. contends, operates primarily by covertly blending Iranian oil with Iraqi oil, which is then marketed intentionally as solely of Iraqi origin. Based on conservative estimates, the U.S. says al-Samarra’i’s network generates around $300 million of value to both Iran and its partners annually. Waleed Khaled Hameed al-Samarra’i, a citizen of both Iraq and St. Kitts & Nevis, runs a network of companies managing vessels that have been involved in the sale of Iranian oil to international markets. To smuggle the Iranian-origin oil, al-Samarra’i uses a group of vessels to blend Iranian and Iraqi oil at sea, via ship-to-ship transfers in the Arabian Gulf, and in Iraqi ports. U.S.-sanctioned vessels publicly affiliated with Iran’s shadow fleet are being employed to distance the network from direct interactions with the Iranian petroleum sector. The vessels also engage in other obfuscation techniques to hide their activities, such as unsafe ship-to-ship transfers at night, Automated Identification System (AIS) spoofing, and conspicuous gaps in AIS location reporting. Al-Samarra’i relies on his two UAE-based companies, Babylon Navigation DMCC and Galaxy Oil FZ LLC, to manage his network’s operations. The tankers, Adena, Liliana, Camilla, Delfina, Bianca, Roberta, Alexandra, Bellagio, and Paola, are Liberian-flagged but owned by several Marshall Islands-based shell companies, the U.S. reports. It is the second time the U.S. has sanctioned a network it says is involved in the blending efforts. In July, it sanctioned the network of Salim Ahmed Said. The U.S. says these efforts are part of its commitment to “eliminating Iran’s pernicious influence on Iraq’s economy and upholding a campaign of maximum economic pressure on Iran.” Experts highlight that Iran continues to look for methods of working around the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry. The U.S. has also been putting pressure on Iraq to crack down on the tankers. In July, Iraqi officials released a list of tankers that they were barring from their oil operations, accusing them of being involved in the obfuscation efforts.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Spill Temporarily Shuts Down a Tanker Mooring at the CPC Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/spill-temporarily-shuts-down-a-tanker-mooring-at-the-cpc-terminal,,02/09/2025 23:58:30,,"A spill has been reported at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium offshore loading terminal near Novorossiysk, Russia, but accounts of its size and significance vary. On August 29, petroleum was released during loading operations at one of the CPC terminal's offshore mooring buoys (SPMs). Satellite imaging released by dissident news outlet Crimean Wind appears to suggest a slick measuring about 21 kilometers in length, extending eastward from the #2 SPM at the CPC site. The publication estimated the size of the release at 5-10 tonnes, equivalent to about 1,500-3,000 gallons. In a statement, the CPC operating consortium said that cleanup had been completed by August 30, and that post-remediation monitoring of air and water detected no excess in pollutant values. No shoreline contamination has been identified, and no sorbents were used for cleanup. Seawater monitoring continues on a twice-daily basis, using a third party laboratory; the total volume of the oil release has not been confirmed by the operator and remains under investigation. One of the terminal's SPMs was shut down after the spill, temporarily leaving only one mooring operational out of three. The CPC terminal is one of the world's most important oil facilities, handling more than one percent of the global crude supply. Though the loading port is located in Russia, little of the oil shipped through it is of Russian origin, as the pipeline's crude is produced in Kazakhstan by Western oil companies. Nonetheless, it has occasionally been affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine, including a drone strike attributed to Ukrainian forces in February.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Video: Meyer Turku in Finland Floats Third Mega Cruise Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-meyer-turku-in-finland-floats-third-mega-cruise-ship,,02/09/2025 23:03:28,,"Meyer Turk in Finland marked the next milestone as it continues at pace in the shipbuilding project for the world’s largest cruise ships. The third vessel, which is named Legend of the Seas, was floated in the assembly dock on August 29 and has now been moved forward to the fitting out berth. This latest achievement came just seven weeks after the delivery of the second cruise ship of the class, Star of the Seas. The third ship was being moved to her fitting out berth as the second ship started its first commercial cruise after a series of preview trips from Port Canaveral, Florida. The floating of the new ship comes after all the structural elements of the assembly are completed and includes ceremonial elements, starting with the firing of a historic cannon to commence the floating. The actual floating takes nearly 12 hours to lift the 248,663 gross ton cruise ship. Measuring 1,196 feet (364 meters), the cruise ship is nearly the length of the assembly dry dock. After the ship is floated, they open the massive doors on the front of the dock and use tugs to pull the ship forward. ""Legend of the Seas continues the state-of-the-art Icon Class, which allows the Finnish maritime industry to showcase its unique expertise at its best,” said Casimir Lindholm, CEO of Meyer Turku. “The shipyard, Royal Caribbean, and an extensive network of partners work together to develop the processes and concepts from ship to ship. Alongside its sister ships, Legend of the Seas will also mark an important milestone in increasingly responsible shipbuilding.” The ship, like her sisters, is outfitted with a broad range of amusements and attractions for passengers, ranging from an infinity swimming pool and water slides to the massive glass Aqua Dome entertainment venue above the bridge the ship and a range of dining options. The ship, when completed, will have over 2,800 passenger cabins and suites able to accommodate approximately 6,700 passengers and 2,350 crew when full. The Legend of the Seas is due to enter service for Royal Caribbean International in the summer of 2026, first in the Mediterranean and then repositioning for cruises ot the Caribbean. Like her two sister ships and the Oasis class Utopia of the Seas, Legend of the Seas will be fueled by LNG. It has other technologies, including waste heat recovery systems and shore power connections, to its environmental impact. The pace of construction will continue at Meyer Turku with the first blocks of the fourth ship of the class expected to be placed into the assembly dock in the coming weeks. Royal Caribbean Group ordered the fourth ship in August 2024 for delivery in 2027. The company also has unexercised options with Meyer Turku for a potential fifth and sixth ship of the class. The cruise industry is pushing forward to build more cruise ships exceeding the 200,000 gross ton size. Royal Caribbean has also ordered an additional Oasis class cruise ship (236,473 gross tons) from Chantiers de l’Atlantique, while MSC Cruises has also ordered four more of its World class cruise ships (215,000 gross tons) from the French yard. This week, Disney Cruise Line’s Disney Adventure (206,500 gross tons) began sea trials ahead of her entry into service in December. Carnival Cruise Line has ordered three cruise ships for its Project Ace (230,000 gross tons), which will be built at Fincantieri, starting delivery in 2029, and Norwegian Cruise Line has ordered four 227,000 gross ton cruise also to be built by Fincantieri for delivery starting in 2030.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Survivor of Sewol Sinking Arrested After Tussle Outside Gov't Office,https://maritime-executive.com/article/survivor-of-sewol-sinking-arrested-after-tussle-outside-gov-t-office,,02/09/2025 22:39:22,,"A man who claimed to be a survivor of the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking has been arrested outside a government office in Seoul after he demanded a meeting with the president's office. The man was allegedly in possession of a weapon in a public space, a chargeable offense in South Korea. On Tuesday, local police in Seoul said that they had arrested the man after he approached police officers outside of the ministry of defense building in Seoul's Yongsan district. The building is currently the official residence of South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, and the man demanded to meet with the presidential office to petition for improved support for the survivors of the Sewol tragedy. The man scuffled with police for 20 minutes, and eventually officers used a taser to subdue him. He was given first aid for injuries sustained in the altercation, and was taken to a hospital for treatment. The authorities conducted and investigation and ultimately released him to return home. On April 16, 2014, the ferry Sewol was under way on a voyage to the southern resort island of Jeju. The majority of those aboard were high school students and their teachers on a school field trip, and there were several hundred teenagers on the ship out of a total of 476 passengers and crew. The ferry capsized unexpectedly, and 303 passengers died trapped inside, including 261 students. Many of the deceased obeyed crew instructions to remain in their cabins, even as crew members were seen on TV abandoning the sinking vessel. An investigation determined that Sewol was overloaded and under-ballasted on the casualty voyage; extensive structural modifications to her upper decks had reduced her GM, and the vessel capsized in a turn, then quickly sank. After a public campaign by the victims' families, the vessel was raised at great cost and transferred to the port of Mokpo for further analysis. In the political firestorm that followed, South Korean president Park Geun-hye's approval rating plummeted, damaging her prospects and eventually contributing to her ouster in 2016. Nine Korea Coast Guard officials were indicted in connection with the Sewol's certification and operation (though all were acquitted); the master received a sentence of life in prison for abandoning ship without his passengers. Students who survived the tragedy received extensive support, including 70 days of counseling and a special admissions program giving them privileged access to top universities. But in retrospective interviews with Korea Herald, survivors said that they are still haunted by the experience, and some still struggle with mental illness.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52
Australian Dockworkers Arrested as “Trusted Insiders” for Drug Smugglers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australian-dockworkers-arrested-as-trusted-insiders-for-drug-smugglers,,02/09/2025 21:53:19,,"The Australian Federal Police arrested three individuals working on the docks in Sydney, who they believe were working as “trusted insiders” assisting with drug smuggling into the country. The arrests came as they also intercepted 506 kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of over US$100 million, along with large sums of cash in the homes of the individuals. This weekend’s arrests came after five months of investigation by a Multi-Agency Strike Team formed to target a criminal syndicate that was importing large quantities of drugs into the country. The police report that the suspected the smugglers were being aided by insiders at the port. Using intelligence, the task force was acting on information that a container was coming into the port and that the smugglers planned to remove large quantities of cocaine from the box once it was landed and placed in port storage. The containers coming from Europe with legitimate cargo, along with empty containers being returned to the storage area. The port was under observation when they saw a forklift driver on Sunday, August 31, moving containers around, apparently trying to gain access to one particular box. A short time later, a second person appeared with a bag and entered the container. When the man was apprehended, the police reported the bag contained a crowbar, an angle grinder, ear protection, portable lights, and other hand tools. The investigation showed the man was using the tools to cut into a false wall at the rear of the shipping container. When the police removed the false wall, they found 506 individual blocks of cocaine covered with lead sheeting. Police seized 506 kg of cocaine from a container at the port of Sydney (AFP) Two forklift drivers and the third man were arrested and charged with aiding the importation of illegal narcotics. Media reports say they face up to life in prison if convicted. A search of two of the individuals’ homes uncovered over US$216,000 in cash. While the shipping container was sent from Europe, the police report that they are still working to identify the source of the drugs. They are also continuing the investigation for anyone else who was involved in the plot. The Australian authorities report that they are continuing their vigilance to intercept smuggling efforts. Last week, they reported the arrest of four individuals who they believe were part of a ketamine smuggling effort. They seized 45 kg of ketamine hidden inside 66 car drive shafts being imported at the port of Sydney. European authorities in the past have reported that they believed the smuggling rings were using employees of port to aid in their efforts. Port employees have been suspected of helping the smugglers to gain access codes to arriving containers or aiding in the transfer of the boxes out of the port to designated places for offloading. Last December, the Australian authorities seized a record 2.3 tons of cocaine off Queensland. It started with a broken-down fishing boat and resulted in the arrest of 13 people.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 04:26:52

The CyberBoat Challenge: Cybersecurity Education for the MTS,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-cyberboat-challenge-cybersecurity-education-for-the-mts,,03/09/2025 05:00:17,,"The information security industry has lamented the lack of available skilled and talented workers for the last three decades. A common estimate today is that there are a million unfilled cybersecurity-related positions in the U.S. alone. The absence of skilled cybersecurity workers has a particular impact on the maritime transportation system (MTS) because ""traditional"" cyberdefense skills do not directly translate to the maritime information ecosystem, so we are even further behind. The maritime domain is a highly intertwined system of systems, composed of a complex and interconnected collection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). Maritime's information ecosystem is a mix of data centers, networks, sensors, communication systems, and end-user devices that are subject to the same cyberdefense requirements as the rest of the information universe. That said, the MTS has unique cybersecurity requirements, including the combination of many moving and stationary parts; smart ships, ports, and cargo; cyber-physical systems and operational technology; maritime-specific navigation and situational awareness systems; and human-machine interfaces. The CyberBoat Challenge started in 2022 and has become an annual educational event, bringing together cybersecurity students learning about maritime systems, industry partners and government. It is a cooperative learning opportunity where students examine the maritime environment and maritime information systems in order to understand the protocols, operations and interfaces - and how they all relate to the real world. Traditional methods of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development benefit from new and innovative ideas in order to teach students about the many niche technical specialties that have emerged in last couple of decades and, in particular, to develop the next generation of cyberdefense professionals in the maritime industry. Maritime product vendors, ports, shipping lines, merchant mariners, and others in the maritime domain need to be creative in where we find people for cyber roles, which might include professionals from the engine room or the bridge. The maritime industry must also engage more fully with academic institutions to channel students in understanding the unique needs within the maritime domain. A handful of colleges and universities in the U.S. and globally are already focusing on maritime in their computer science, computer engineering, cybersecurity, or other related programs. The CyberBoat Challenge provides one way in which faculty and students from these — and other — academic institutions can meet and network. The CyberBoat events specifically seek industry and government involvement to help create a miniature ecosystem which not only helps students understand the context of the material and problems, but also helps them form ties with potential mentors and potential employers regardless if their goals are industry, government, academia, or the security community. There is an adage that engineers don't understand security. This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the most common software flaws reported today are the same as the most common software flaws reported 25 years ago. All too often, engineers work in solution space and not problem space; i.e., they work on solving known problems but they're not necessarily trained to go out and seek new problems hidden in our increasingly complex technology systems. Indeed, most undergraduate courses teach technical topics by assigning problem sets rather than assigning students to find problems. By bringing together people with diverse academic and experiential backgrounds, students new to this information environment can exercise the critical thinking necessary to identify problems that we may not yet have recognized before they appeared in tragic ways. Every time an accidental event occurs in an IT or OT system on a ship or at a port, cyber processionals — and adversaries — look to see if there's a cyberattack vector that might deliberately cause the same outcome. Consider the failure of a microswitch in the steering control system on BBC Africa, causing her to collide with Common Faith in Houston in August 2023, or the tripped breaker resulting in a power failure on Dali, causing an allision with — and catastrophic failure of — the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024. CyberBoat is not a cyber competition. The event is pro-industry, and its raison d'être is to help industry understand and address cybersecurity challenges. It is a resource for participants to draw on in terms of augmenting education; making industry connections; understanding the needs, priorities, and remedies of sister organizations; understanding the perspective and role of governmental agencies; and as a recruitment resource for companies looking for interns and employees. It also helps to build a cohort of students learning a new way to think critically about problem identification and solution. While this is a new approach within the maritime domain to address a long-existent problem, the CyberBoat Challenge is using a well-known engagement and education model which was pioneered by its ""elder siblings"" — CyberAuto Challenge since 2012 and CyberTruck Challenge since 2017 — which have served as a training and mentoring asset for industry, academia, government, and students, and has seen many hundreds of past participants enter the transportation cybersecurity field. This training system works and has had positive effects in the community of interest. The next CyberBoat Challenge is in December and will be held at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.

Iranian Navy Stands Down From its Wartime Posture,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-stands-down-from-its-wartime-posture,,03/09/2025 04:21:00,,"The Iranian Navy (Nedaja) appears to have finally stood down from its wartime posture. Its principal ships returned to port, having spent three months away from their base in Bandar Abbas save for short trips back into port for replenishment. In imagery taken on September 2, five operational Alvand and Moudge-class frigates were tied up in the Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, as was the intelligence collector IRINS Zagros (H313). Two Hengam Class landing ships (IRINS Tonb (L513) and Lavan (L514)) are also alongside, with a third vessel of the class IRINS Larak (L512) still under refurbishment in the floating dry dock close by. Bandar Abbas-class replenishment ship IRINS Bushehr (K422) is present, as are three of the seven-strong Delvar-class fleet of cargo and ammunition ships. Also back in base are nine Sina and Kaman-class fast attack craft - for several months, only three such boats, probably non-operational, had been seen in the harbor. From the quality of imagery available to open source analysts, it is not possible to see if the single operational Kilo-class submarine IRINS Tarek (S901) is out or at its normal berth, but the two other Kilo submarines are out of the water in the dry docks alongside a Moudge-class frigate. It seems as if only one frigate - IRINS Bayandor (F81) - is out of Bandar Abbas, and this ship is often seen tied up in the new Jask Naval Harbor operating in support of Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani’s 2nd Naval Region. This disposition suggests that the Nedaja has no long-range patrols deployed outside coastal areas. The presence since 2008 of a flotilla on rotation in the Red Sea was abandoned when the 100th Flotilla returned home to Bandar Abbas at the beginning of this year. The posture also suggests that the Nedaja does not feel at risk from a resumption of either Israeli or American attacks, which are expected by the political leadership in Tehran, but which the Nedaja may feel would be directed instead against the IRGC, the political leadership, nuclear weapons associated targets and ballistic missile infrastructure. Also seen in imagery on September 2 is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441), at its usual pier in the outer harbor. For several weeks now, an unidentified logistics ship has been moored alongside the Makran, possibly a new addition to the Nedaja fleet - and like the Makran, possibly a conversion from an old civilian ship. The mystery ship is 183.5 meters long, not matching anything in the known Nedaja inventory, and has a helicopter deck forward. But between the helicopter deck and the bridge is a davit crane, and on the deck alongside are several Boston Whaler-type boats. Thus this ship could perform the role previously carried out by the IRGC Navy spy ships MV Saviz and MV Behshad. These two ships in turn maintained a stationary position off the Dahlak Bank just inside Eritrean territorial waters, from late 2016 until January 2024, and from which Boston Whaler boats were craned off the deck to make arms runs across the Red Sea to the Houthis in Yemen.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 09:29:12

It is unusual for a wreck of this vintage to be raised to the surface, but despite its rarity, the salvors do not have plans to preserve it. U16 was built in 1911 and fought throughout World War I, sinking nearly 30 vessels and surviving about one dozen combat patrols. The vessel went down in 1919 off the coast of Scharhorn, a German-administered island at the mouth of the Elbe. At the time of the sub's loss, it was under way on a delivery voyage to Britain, where it was to be handed over as part of Germany's postwar reparations. All crewmembers are believed to have survived the sinking. (A local historian, Jann M. Witt, told Tageblatt that it is likely that they scuttled their sub rather than hand it over to the British; another German sub met with the same fate earlier that year.) The wreck stayed at the bottom of the North Sea for more than 100 years before the decision was made to remove it. It has been surveyed more than once, and the latest visit was in 2023, when a vessel of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) passed over the site. The sub's wreckage is within the Elbe federal waterway, according to NDR, and belongs to the Federal Directorate of Waterways and Shipping (WSV). It is not considered a protected war grave for legal purposes. The wreck's other half sits at a depth of about 60 feet of water, and is slated for removal this week, weather permitting. The wreckage itself is likely headed for demolition, despite the WSV's early attempts to find a new home for it. Parts of the sub may be preserved by German museums, but none have stepped forward to take the entirety of the wreck, NDR reports.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

On Tuesday, the White House announced the elimination of 11 suspects who were allegedly transporting narcotics off the coast of Venezuela. ""The president is going to be on offense against drug cartels and drug trafficking in the United States,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters. ""It destabilizes not just the country, but the entire Caribbean basin. These particular drugs were probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.""

The strike occurred in international waters, resulting in 11 fatalities. ""Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,"" Trump wrote. The White House did not disclose if there were any survivors recovered for criminal prosecution, or if the drugs were retrieved from the scene of the interdiction. Historically, maritime smuggling intercepts have been handled by the U.S. Coast Guard using its law enforcement authority, with almost all suspects captured alive.

According to Reuters, seven warships are in the vicinity of Venezuela or are on their way, bringing a combined force of 4,500 sailors and marines with them. The Trump administration considers the Venezuelan regime of dictator Nicolas Maduro to be illegitimate, and the White House has asserted links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua, which it has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. In April, the National Intelligence Council advised that Maduro's administration views Tren de Aragua as a threat, not a partner, and that the ""Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with [Tren de Aragua].""",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
Everllence Breaks Ground on New Danish HQ,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/everllence-breaks-ground-on-new-danish-hq,,03/09/2025 03:38:13,,"[By: Everllence] Everllence has held a groundbreaking ceremony in Roskilde, Denmark to mark the commencement of the building phase of its new Danish headquarters. Called ‘The Valley’, the development is a joint venture between Everllence and Volkswagen Immobilien, the Volkswagen Group’s real-estate division. The company states that its current base in Greater Copenhagen – and its Holeby, southern Denmark site – have given rise to many innovations that drive climate-neutral shipping, including such world-firsts as the high-pressure dual-fuel two-stroke engine, methanol-powered engines, as well as the first firing of a two-stroke engine fuelled by ammonia. However, the sites’ current facilities – particularly at its Copenhagen location – are outdated with major renovations otherwise looming. The decision to relocate is driven then by strategic necessity with The Valley offering space for growth, both in terms of workforce and production capacity, and in an industrial setting that facilitates the testing of new fuel-technologies while ensuring safer logistics. The ceremony was attended by members of the Everllence Executive Board and a number of prominent guests, including: Everllence CEO, Dr Uwe Lauber; Managing Director Volkswagen Immobilien, Hardy Brennecke; Everllence Head of Two-Stroke Business and Country Manager Denmark, Bjarne Foldager; and Mayor of Roskilde, Tomas Breddam. Lauber said: “Today’s event marks a historic milestone in Everllence’s journey. As we turn the first sod in this exciting venture, we are laying the foundation – not just for a new campus, but for a new chapter in our company’s history. Our current facilities in Denmark have served us well but were not built for the future we are envisaging. This location is purposely designed for excellence, tailored to the unique needs of our people, our technologies, and our decarbonisation aspirations. The future starts here – and it starts now.” Located on the site of a former gravel pit, The Valley campus lies 40 km west of Copenhagen and will comprise a 70,000 m2 complex of buildings including office space for at least 1,500 workstations, a teaching academy, meeting centre and an employee club. Construction by general contractor, DS Flexhal, will also see the building of a production unit and warehouse, as well as a research centre with testing facilities. Speaking on behalf of VW Immobilien, Brennecke said: “The traditional groundbreaking ceremony for ‘The Valley Campus’ marks the start of construction for a special real-estate project. Over the next few years, modern, sustainable office and production facilities, an academy, and meeting areas will be built on the approximately 175,000 m2 site. With this sustainable construction project, Everllence is underscoring its successful business development. We wish everyone involved in the project a thriving and accident-free construction period.” Foldager said: ”This project is also a strategic consolidation that brings together our teams from Copenhagen and Holeby, creating an environment where expertise meets collaboration, where two-stroke meets four-stroke – and with room to grow, free from the constraints of residential surroundings. Here, we can innovate safely, efficiently, and responsibly – especially as we work with new fuels like ammonia. Together, we are building more than a main location for Everllence in Denmark; we are building a legacy.”",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

The investment group with $465 billion of assets under management has decided to enter the business due to the strong opportunities. Altera currently has a fleet of six FPSOs deployed in Brazil, Dubai, and Cote d’Ivoire. It also has two FSOs operating off Cote d’Ivoire and in the Gulf of Thailand. “This is a rare opportunity to acquire an established and high-quality FPSO business with a strong management team, operating track record and long-term cashflows,” said Bob Maguire, Co-Head of Carlyle International Energy Partners (CIEP). “This portfolio benefits from long-term contracts, strong FPSO market fundamentals, and exposure to world-class operators which position it well for success.” It is part of continuing efforts that have been reshaping the business of UK-based Altera Infrastructure. It reorganized through the US bankruptcy proceeding in late 2022. At the end of last year, it sold its interests in Altera Shuttle Tankers, a fleet of 18 shuttle tankers in Brazil, Canada, and the North Sea, to Maistros Shiptrade, a company affiliated with the Angelicoussis Group. The business being acquired by Carlyle includes ownership of the FPSOs and the FSO (Floating Storage and Offloading), which are underpinned by long-term contracts with major oil and gas companies. The portfolio includes the Petrojarl Kong FPSO and FSO Yamoussoukro, deployed in the Ivory Coast with Eni, which represents the first net-zero emission upstream project in Africa, the Piranema FPSO, as well as 50 percent of the Altera&Ocyan joint-venture asset Pioneiro de Libra FPSO, deployed in Brazil with Petrobras. Additionally, the business has a strong pipeline of future growth and redeployment opportunities. Carlyle says it will support the Altera FPSO business through its sector-specific investment team.

Coast Guard Awards Contract to Begin Overhaul at Base Seattle,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/coast-guard-awards-contract-to-begin-overhaul-at-base-seattle,,03/09/2025 01:17:11,,"The U.S. Coast Guard has awarded a contract to start modernization works to prepare for homeporting its future Polar Security Cutters in Seattle. Whiting-Turner Contracting won an award worth about $140 million for the first phase of the project, to include construction of two large cutter berths and dredging of a slip to the depth required for the PSC hulls. The first phase (1A) will widen the slip between two berths, add upgraded utility installations, remove an existing building, and install waterfront stabilization structures. It will also see the renovation of Station Seattle's existing boathouse and small boat docks. After this phase and the next two are completed, Base Seattle will have four large cutter berths, enough to support a range of oceangoing vessels. In planning, the Coast Guard said that its preferred alternative is to acquire part of Terminal 46, just to the north of the base, and upgrade 1,000-plus feet of existing commercial wharfage to provide extra space for cutters. Seattle has been the home port for the service's medium and heavy icebreakers for years, and it benefits from the area's well-developed industrial base and the presence of a major shipyard nearby. It will continue to be the service's primary home port for icebreakers, with an exception for USCGC Storis, which will have a base of her own in Juneau. Coast Guard Base Seattle evolved organically as the service's needs grew in the region. After decades of berthing its cutters wherever there was space available along the commercial waterfront, the service acquired Piers 36 and 37 from the Army Corps of Engineers in 1966. That facility has been headquarters for Sector Puget Sound and Base Seattle ever since, and its infrastructure is aging. Base improvements have historically taken a back seat for the cash-strapped Coast Guard, which has long struggled to find funding to keep its shoreside infrastructure in working shape. After years of budget sequestration and deferred maintenance, the USCG received a major boost in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which provided a much-needed $4.4 billion for reconstructing shoreside facilities. USCG stations across the country can share a combined $2.8 billion appropriation for construction; Alaska is getting a congressionally line-itemed $300 million facility for USCGC Storis; the Coast Guard Yard is getting a new drydock for $500 million; and the service's enlisted bootcamp at Cape May is getting a $425 million revamp. Shortly after announcing the Base Seattle contract award, the Coast Guard announced its first ever One Big Beautiful Bill expenditure, a smaller $15 million contract extension awarded to Whiting-Turner for pier renovation at Base Charleston in South Carolina.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

Trump Administration to Target SouthCoast Wind in War on Wind Power,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-to-target-southcoast-wind-in-war-on-wind-power,,03/09/2025 01:11:52,,"It was revealed in a court filing on Friday, August 29, that the Trump administration, through the Department of the Interior, plans to reconsider permits issued last year to the SouthCoast offshore wind project. It comes as the administration has sought to make good on Donald Trump’s opposition to “windmills” by issuing stop work orders, freezing new permits, reconsidering existing permits, and withdrawing tax credits and funding grants. The Department of Justice filed a motion in a suit brought by the Town of Nantucket, Massachusetts, appealing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December 2024 approval of South Coast Wind as the nation’s 11th commercial-scale offshore wind energy project. The suit alleges flaws in the permitting process, saying that BOEN violated federal environmental law by approving the project without requiring the developer to properly mitigate harm from the efforts. Nantucket says it gave the project’s developers multiple opportunities to address the island’s concerns prior to filing suit on March 27. It alleges the approval “creates a dangerous precedent” that allows fossil fuel developers the opportunity to also fast-track projects and avoid safeguards. They contend the suit is to reinforce environmental and preservation laws. The Department of Justice told the court on Friday that the suit “makes little sense” because it plans to formally move for reconsideration of the permit by September 18. It is the same tactic DOJ and the Trump administration reported it is taking for Maryland’s first offshore wind project, which was also approved in 2024. They plan to file the reconsideration effort against the permits for US Wind’s Maryland wind farm project by September 12. SouthCoast Wind is being developed by Ocean Wind North America, a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie. The project, which was then known as Mayflower Wind, won its lease in a December 2018 auction. The approved plan calls for the construction of up to 141 wind turbine generators and up to five offshore substation platforms with the potential to generate up to 2,400 MW. It would be located about 26 nautical miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 20 nm south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The Town’s opposition is part of its broader efforts against the wind industry. They contend that if all the proposed projects were developed, there would be an estimated 743 wind turbines located off Nantucket’s coastline. A total of nine wind farm sites have been designated for the area. The company filed a motion with the court opposing the government’s call for an extension while it pursues the effort to reconsider the permits. The motion says the effort is part of the government’s larger efforts to eliminate all offshore wind projects regardless of their impact. The federal government has unleashed efforts on all fronts, including the president’s executive order to review the industry and freeze permitting. They briefly stopped work on the Empire Wind project in New York before it started offshore work, and now have stopped Resolution Wind in Massachusetts, which is 80 percent installed. Grants for port projects to support the industry have now been withdrawn, and the administration said it was launching a review of the offshore wind industry on the grounds of national security concerns. The governors of five states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island) issued a joint statement on September 1, calling on the administration to uphold the permits that have already been issued for offshore wind projects. The states had previously filed suit against the administration over the president’s executive order to review the industry.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
U.S. Sanctions Efforts to Blend Iranian and Iraqi Oil to Avoid Restrictions,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-sanctions-efforts-to-blend-iranian-and-iraqi-oil-to-avoid-restrictions,,03/09/2025 00:09:41,,"US Sanctions Efforts to Blend Iranian and Iraqi Oil to Avoid Trade Restrictions The United States, through its sanctions program, is increasing the pressure on the Iranian oil trade and the efforts to obfuscate the origins of the oil by blending. New sanctions announced on September 2 by the U.S. the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) targeted the business network of a UAE-based businessman, Waleed al-Samarra’I, and nine Liberian-flagged tankers, which the U.S. says have generated millions of dollars in oil revenue. The network, the U.S. contends, operates primarily by covertly blending Iranian oil with Iraqi oil, which is then marketed intentionally as solely of Iraqi origin. Based on conservative estimates, the U.S. says al-Samarra’i’s network generates around $300 million of value to both Iran and its partners annually. Waleed Khaled Hameed al-Samarra’i, a citizen of both Iraq and St. Kitts & Nevis, runs a network of companies managing vessels that have been involved in the sale of Iranian oil to international markets. To smuggle the Iranian-origin oil, al-Samarra’i uses a group of vessels to blend Iranian and Iraqi oil at sea, via ship-to-ship transfers in the Arabian Gulf, and in Iraqi ports. U.S.-sanctioned vessels publicly affiliated with Iran’s shadow fleet are being employed to distance the network from direct interactions with the Iranian petroleum sector. The vessels also engage in other obfuscation techniques to hide their activities, such as unsafe ship-to-ship transfers at night, Automated Identification System (AIS) spoofing, and conspicuous gaps in AIS location reporting. Al-Samarra’i relies on his two UAE-based companies, Babylon Navigation DMCC and Galaxy Oil FZ LLC, to manage his network’s operations. The tankers, Adena, Liliana, Camilla, Delfina, Bianca, Roberta, Alexandra, Bellagio, and Paola, are Liberian-flagged but owned by several Marshall Islands-based shell companies, the U.S. reports. It is the second time the U.S. has sanctioned a network it says is involved in the blending efforts. In July, it sanctioned the network of Salim Ahmed Said. The U.S. says these efforts are part of its commitment to “eliminating Iran’s pernicious influence on Iraq’s economy and upholding a campaign of maximum economic pressure on Iran.” Experts highlight that Iran continues to look for methods of working around the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry. The U.S. has also been putting pressure on Iraq to crack down on the tankers. In July, Iraqi officials released a list of tankers that they were barring from their oil operations, accusing them of being involved in the obfuscation efforts.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

On August 29, petroleum was released during loading operations at one of the CPC terminal's offshore mooring buoys (SPMs). Satellite imaging released by dissident news outlet Crimean Wind appears to suggest a slick measuring about 21 kilometers in length, extending eastward from the #2 SPM at the CPC site. The publication estimated the size of the release at 5-10 tonnes, equivalent to about 1,500-3,000 gallons. In a statement, the CPC operating consortium said that cleanup had been completed by August 30, and that post-remediation monitoring of air and water detected no excess in pollutant values. No shoreline contamination has been identified, and no sorbents were used for cleanup. Seawater monitoring continues on a twice-daily basis, using a third party laboratory; the total volume of the oil release has not been confirmed by the operator and remains under investigation. One of the terminal's SPMs was shut down after the spill, temporarily leaving only one mooring operational out of three. The CPC terminal is one of the world's most important oil facilities, handling more than one percent of the global crude supply. Though the loading port is located in Russia, little of the oil shipped through it is of Russian origin, as the pipeline's crude is produced in Kazakhstan by Western oil companies. Nonetheless, it has occasionally been affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine, including a drone strike attributed to Ukrainian forces in February.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

The third vessel, which is named Legend of the Seas, was floated in the assembly dock on August 29 and has now been moved forward to the fitting out berth. This latest achievement came just seven weeks after the delivery of the second cruise ship of the class, Star of the Seas. The third ship was being moved to her fitting out berth as the second ship started its first commercial cruise after a series of preview trips from Port Canaveral, Florida. The floating of the new ship comes after all the structural elements of the assembly are completed and includes ceremonial elements, starting with the firing of a historic cannon to commence the floating. The actual floating takes nearly 12 hours to lift the 248,663 gross ton cruise ship. Measuring 1,196 feet (364 meters), the cruise ship is nearly the length of the assembly dry dock. After the ship is floated, they open the massive doors on the front of the dock and use tugs to pull the ship forward. ""Legend of the Seas continues the state-of-the-art Icon Class, which allows the Finnish maritime industry to showcase its unique expertise at its best,” said Casimir Lindholm, CEO of Meyer Turku. “The shipyard, Royal Caribbean, and an extensive network of partners work together to develop the processes and concepts from ship to ship. Alongside its sister ships, Legend of the Seas will also mark an important milestone in increasingly responsible shipbuilding.” The ship, like her sisters, is outfitted with a broad range of amusements and attractions for passengers, ranging from an infinity swimming pool and water slides to the massive glass Aqua Dome entertainment venue above the bridge the ship and a range of dining options. The ship, when completed, will have over 2,800 passenger cabins and suites able to accommodate approximately 6,700 passengers and 2,350 crew when full. The Legend of the Seas is due to enter service for Royal Caribbean International in the summer of 2026, first in the Mediterranean and then repositioning for cruises ot the Caribbean. Like her two sister ships and the Oasis class Utopia of the Seas, Legend of the Seas will be fueled by LNG. It has other technologies, including waste heat recovery systems and shore power connections, to its environmental impact. The pace of construction will continue at Meyer Turku with the first blocks of the fourth ship of the class expected to be placed into the assembly dock in the coming weeks. Royal Caribbean Group ordered the fourth ship in August 2024 for delivery in 2027. The company also has unexercised options with Meyer Turku for a potential fifth and sixth ship of the class. The cruise industry is pushing forward to build more cruise ships exceeding the 200,000 gross ton size. Royal Caribbean has also ordered an additional Oasis class cruise ship (236,473 gross tons) from Chantiers de l’Atlantique, while MSC Cruises has also ordered four more of its World class cruise ships (215,000 gross tons) from the French yard. This week, Disney Cruise Line’s Disney Adventure (206,500 gross tons) began sea trials ahead of her entry into service in December. Carnival Cruise Line has ordered three cruise ships for its Project Ace (230,000 gross tons), which will be built at Fincantieri, starting delivery in 2029, and Norwegian Cruise Line has ordered four 227,000 gross ton cruise also to be built by Fincantieri for delivery starting in 2030.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

The man scuffled with police for 20 minutes, and eventually officers used a taser to subdue him. He was given first aid for injuries sustained in the altercation, and was taken to a hospital for treatment. The authorities conducted and investigation and ultimately released him to return home. On April 16, 2014, the ferry Sewol was under way on a voyage to the southern resort island of Jeju. The majority of those aboard were high school students and their teachers on a school field trip, and there were several hundred teenagers on the ship out of a total of 476 passengers and crew. The ferry capsized unexpectedly, and 303 passengers died trapped inside, including 261 students. Many of the deceased obeyed crew instructions to remain in their cabins, even as crew members were seen on TV abandoning the sinking vessel. An investigation determined that Sewol was overloaded and under-ballasted on the casualty voyage; extensive structural modifications to her upper decks had reduced her GM, and the vessel capsized in a turn, then quickly sank. After a public campaign by the victims' families, the vessel was raised at great cost and transferred to the port of Mokpo for further analysis. In the political firestorm that followed, South Korean president Park Geun-hye's approval rating plummeted, damaging her prospects and eventually contributing to her ouster in 2016. Nine Korea Coast Guard officials were indicted in connection with the Sewol's certification and operation (though all were acquitted); the master received a sentence of life in prison for abandoning ship without his passengers. Students who survived the tragedy received extensive support, including 70 days of counseling and a special admissions program giving them privileged access to top universities. But in retrospective interviews with Korea Herald, survivors said that they are still haunted by the experience, and some still struggle with mental illness.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
Australian Dockworkers Arrested as “Trusted Insiders” for Drug Smugglers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australian-dockworkers-arrested-as-trusted-insiders-for-drug-smugglers,,02/09/2025 21:53:19,,"The Australian Federal Police arrested three individuals working on the docks in Sydney, who they believe were working as “trusted insiders” assisting with drug smuggling into the country. The arrests came as they also intercepted 506 kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of over US$100 million, along with large sums of cash in the homes of the individuals. This weekend’s arrests came after five months of investigation by a Multi-Agency Strike Team formed to target a criminal syndicate that was importing large quantities of drugs into the country. The police report that the suspected the smugglers were being aided by insiders at the port. Using intelligence, the task force was acting on information that a container was coming into the port and that the smugglers planned to remove large quantities of cocaine from the box once it was landed and placed in port storage. The containers coming from Europe with legitimate cargo, along with empty containers being returned to the storage area. The port was under observation when they saw a forklift driver on Sunday, August 31, moving containers around, apparently trying to gain access to one particular box. A short time later, a second person appeared with a bag and entered the container. When the man was apprehended, the police reported the bag contained a crowbar, an angle grinder, ear protection, portable lights, and other hand tools. The investigation showed the man was using the tools to cut into a false wall at the rear of the shipping container. When the police removed the false wall, they found 506 individual blocks of cocaine covered with lead sheeting. Police seized 506 kg of cocaine from a container at the port of Sydney (AFP) Two forklift drivers and the third man were arrested and charged with aiding the importation of illegal narcotics. Media reports say they face up to life in prison if convicted. A search of two of the individuals’ homes uncovered over US$216,000 in cash. While the shipping container was sent from Europe, the police report that they are still working to identify the source of the drugs. They are also continuing the investigation for anyone else who was involved in the plot. The Australian authorities report that they are continuing their vigilance to intercept smuggling efforts. Last week, they reported the arrest of four individuals who they believe were part of a ketamine smuggling effort. They seized 45 kg of ketamine hidden inside 66 car drive shafts being imported at the port of Sydney. European authorities in the past have reported that they believed the smuggling rings were using employees of port to aid in their efforts. Port employees have been suspected of helping the smugglers to gain access codes to arriving containers or aiding in the transfer of the boxes out of the port to designated places for offloading. Last December, the Australian authorities seized a record 2.3 tons of cocaine off Queensland. It started with a broken-down fishing boat and resulted in the arrest of 13 people.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
Russian Authorities Detained Sanctioned Tanker for Unpaid Crew Wages,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russian-authorities-detained-sanctioned-tanker-for-unpaid-crew-wages,,02/09/2025 20:02:19,,"A shadow fleet tanker that is currently sanctioned in the West was reportedly detained by the Russian authorities in the port of Murmansk due to a range of issues, including unpaid crew wages, reports the Russian Seafarers’ Union. The crew of the vessel raised concerns to the union, which says it referred the matter to the Murmansk port captain’s office. The tanker named Unity (108,929 dwt) is typical of the shadow fleet. Built in 2009, it is reportedly being managed by a shipping company from the UAE. The ship is now showing a registry in Lesotho, having switched in August from Gambia. Databases show the vessel has changed names and flags four times since 2021, including twice in 2024 and briefly under the Russian flag from September 2024 to February 2025. The union reports the 20-person crew is due nearly $90,000 as of August 13 in back pay. They only received their pay for June on July 27, and further said that the crew that had been signed off had also not received pay. The crew is also seeking compensation for sailing through a pirate danger zone and fines for late payments. Concerns are being raised about the legal ownership of the vessel, saying that when its registry in Gambia expired on August 5, the vessel’s ownership was changed on the paperwork from Argo Tanker Group to Petroleum United FZCO. The concern is that some of the crew’s employment contracts are with Argo, and the insurance was also changed. “Sailors fear that since the vessel has indeed changed its flag and registry company, all contracts on board are invalid, and they will not be able to apply to the P&I if the shipowner is unable to fulfill contractual obligations regarding the payment of wages,” said Olga Ananyina of the Russian Seafarers’ Union. The port control inspection conducted in Murmansk on August 28 is reported to have confirmed numerous violations. The authorities detailed the vessel until the discrepancies were corrected. The AIS signal shows the vessel as underway on September 2, but it is suspect and could be spoofed. The tanker has been sanctioned by the EU and UK, as well as Australia, Canada, and Switzerland, for its involvement in the Russian oil trade. The union also reports that Argo Tanker Group, which is listed in databases with a mailing address in Moscow, was also cited by the authorities for failing to pay more than $130,000 to the crew of another tanker named Dignity. The 159,426 dwt tanker operates under the Russian flag, transporting oil from Murmansk, but so far has not been sanctioned. The Moscow Times reports a strong rise in late or unpaid wages across Russia. It cites government statistics that show the total amount due has doubled over the past year. As of the end of July, it was reported to be at nearly $13 million. The paper cited the high rate charged by the Central Bank as a key problem for businesses to take out loans to cover operating expenses.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
Oil Exports Resume After 14 Years from Syria’s Tartus Port,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/oil-exports-resume-after-14-years-from-syria-s-tartus-port,,02/09/2025 18:38:29,,"The first cargo of Syrian crude oil to be exported from the port of Tartus since the Syrian civil war was lifted on September 1. The Greek-owned tanker Nissos Christiana (114,264 dwt), loaded 600,000 barrels of heavy crude oil according to the Syrian Ministry of Energy. The cargo has been purchased by BB Energy, a global oil-trading firm, for an unknown final customer. The vessel, which was built in 2015, is managed by Kyklades Maritime and registered in Greece. According to its AIS signal, it has yet to depart Syria, but the Ministry is calling it an important step in revitalizing the oil sector and broadening international cooperation. Given the volume of oil lifted, most if not all the crude must have come from oil fields in Rojava, the Kurdish-controlled territory in the north east of Syria controlled by the Democratic Union Party (PYD). The PYD as part of its reconciliation with the new government in Damascus permitted oil exports to recommence in February, although supply may have been disrupted recently by renewed tensions between the PYD and the government. In 2010, the last full year before production was disrupted, Syria exported a modest 380,000 barrels of oil per day. Shell had developed and operated the largest Syrian oil field in conjunction with government interests, but suspended production in 2011 when EU sanctions were imposed. The second-largest foreign operator was France’s Total, also government-tied. The revival of Tartus as a crude export terminal comes as DP World has signed an $800 million agreement with the Syrian government under which it will develop and manage the port. DP World replaced the previous Russian operator OAO Stroytransgaz who had operated the port since 2019. The Russian submarine Novorossky seems to be leaving the Med. Together with tug Jakob Grebelsky, the pair is now sailing NW in the central Mediterranean at 11–15 kts.#Russia https://t.co/nFA8blhdDs The Russian Navy appears to have finally closed its links with Tartus, previously the supply and maintenance base for its Mediterranean Flotilla. Earlier this month, without docking the Russian Kilo Class submarine RFS Novorossiksk (B261) was active off Tartus for several weeks, the last remnant of the Mediterranean Flotilla still operating in the Mediterranean. In an extraordinary reversal of fortunes, the open source analyst italmilradar has plotted what appears to be the imminent departure of the Novorossiksk and its accompanying Goryn Class tug Yakov Grebelskiy through the Straits of Gibraltar - which would mark the end of the permanent Russian presence in the Mediterranean - albeit further visits can be expected.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
LISW25 to Highlight Role of Maritime Charities,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/lisw25-to-highlight-role-of-maritime-charities,,02/09/2025 05:29:06,,"The vital role maritime charities play within the industry will be discussed on the opening day of London International Shipping Week 2025 (LISW25).

Royal Navy Uses Drone Deliveries for STS Transfers for the First Time,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-uses-drone-deliveries-for-sts-transfers-for-the-first-time,,02/09/2025 05:05:22,,"The Royal Navy carrier HMS Prince of Wales has debuted the service's first operational use of cargo drones for ship to ship transfers while on deployment to the Indo-Pacific. Prince of Wales and her crew used a Malloy T-150 quadcopter drone to transfer goods from the carrier to the destroyer HMS Dauntless, eliminating the need to use a helicopter or small craft for small-package flights. The drone flew a short one-mile transit from one ship to the other, and a crew aboard Dauntless guided it in for each landing. ""This is a key milestone for the trial, achieved by all the hard work that everyone has put in. I’m proud to have achieved this first for the Royal Navy and excited to progress further over the duration of the deployment,"" said Lieutenant Matt Parfitt, 700X Pioneer Flight Commander. The service has been experimenting with drone delivery services for a long time. Five years ago, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines began testing the Malloy T-150 for shoreside ammunition drops and combat supply deliveries during amphibious assault exercises, and also began work on testing the larger T-400 for bigger payloads. In 2023, a Royal Navy team trialed a much larger fixed-wing cargo drone for shore-to-carrier deliveries, the W Autonomous Systems HCMC, which has a payload of 100 kilos and a range of more than 850 nautical miles. The Malloy T-150 fills a sweet spot for small ship-to-ship transfers, and does not require a big deck for landing on each end of the trip. ""This milestone in the Malloy trials is a step toward the vision of a fully integrated hybrid carrier air wing. By taking some of the logistics burden, Malloy will allow our naval helicopters to concentrate on their core outputs,"" said Captain Colin McGannity, Commander Air Group, UK Carrier Strike Group. ""The really exciting bit is that we then plan to incorporate these lessons to be able to use UAVs for many other roles, including options for warfighting.""",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01
China is Set to Unveil a Full Set of New Hypersonic Missiles,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/china-is-set-to-unveil-a-full-set-of-new-hypersonic-missiles,,02/09/2025 04:48:59,,"China is set to unveil its new hypersonic anti-ship missile at a parade in Beijing to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The YJ-17 has previously been kept under wraps. The YJ-17, from the Eagle Strike missile family, is reported to be able to reach Mach 8, or over 6,000 mph, and to be able to hit targets at a range of 750 miles. It is believed to have an evasive maneuver capability in its terminal flight phase, and can be vertically-launched from ships. The previously unseen YJ-17 has been seen alongside a number of other new recently introduced missiles in the mounting areas in Beijing where Wednesday’s parade is being rehearsed. These include the YJ-19 and YJ-20, both hypersonic anti-ship cruise missile, with the YJ-19 capable of being fired from ships. Various new missiles (ship UVLS launch?) confirmed, my 2c on roles: - YJ-15, ramjet compact supersonic? - YJ-17, waverider hypersonic glide? - YJ-19, ?maybe scramjet hypersonic? - YJ-20, biconical hypersonic/aeroballistic? Possibly seen before from 055.. Via REautomaton, SDF pic.twitter.com/9061QDAi09 The YJ-17 missile in particular - when operational on board Chinese ships - will be a new threat to US carriers operating in the Pacific, which the US Navy is seeking to counter by introducing new missile systems of its own. The AGM-158C LRASM long-range cruise missiles can be launched from carrier-borne aircraft. Block V Maritime Strike Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of over 1,000 miles are programmed to be operationally-ready aboard US destroyers by the end of this month. Both the US Navy and the Air Force are also engaged in a rapid procurement project known as MACE to acquire a cheaper and longer ranged air-launched missile, capable of being launched from stealth aircraft. No doubt the effectiveness of US defensive anti-missile systems will also need to be reevaluated to determine if they are capable of dealing with the hypersonic closing speed of the YJ-17. Also part of the strategy to counter the developing threat is the use of forward islands in the western Pacific, from which the US Marine Indo-Pacific Long Range Fires Battalion can launch SM-6 based Typhon missiles, a tactic rehearsed during the recent Exercise Talisman Sabre in Northern Australia. On the basis of equipment seen parked up for rehearsals, the 80th anniversary parade is likely to mark an uprating on China’s part of its aggressive stance towards the United States, Japan and Taiwan, probably also to be reflected in the speech which will be made by Chinese leader President Xi Jinping during the parade. Also attending the parade will be Russia’s President Putin and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. As a political event, the parade will mark the revival of President Xi’s ascendancy, after a period when it was thought that internal opposition to his martial leanings had diminished his standing. A meeting of the Shanghai Co-operation Organization preceded the parade, attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – a sign of an Indian-Chinese rapprochement amidst pressure from Washington - as well as leaders of two NATO countries, Recep Erdogan of Turkey and Robert Fico of Slovakia.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 15:41:01

Floating Data Centers on Fast-Flowing Rivers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/floating-data-centers-on-fast-flowing-rivers,,03/09/2025 20:15:19,,"Advances in information processing technology and programming have increased the need for data centers capable of processing massive volumes of information. Data centers that float on water provide ready access to cooling capacity, with potential to convert the energy from sea waves and river currents to electrical energy to operate the onboard technology. Introduction Data centers process massive amounts of information and require continuous and reliable access to large amounts of electric power and substantial cooling capacity. When located on land in arid regions where solar photovoltaic energy is available, data centers require roof-mounted air-cooling technology that consumes massive amounts of electrical power. While waterfront coastal locations provide easy and available access to water cooling, market demand for such locations is very high, with high real estate prices. A cubic volume of water can provide over 3,400 times the thermal capacity of an identical cubic volume of air. Even in warm climates, the temperature of coastal seawater and river water is often cooler than air temperature. At locations where winds blow constantly, wind energy generates waves. It is possible for some technologies to convert energy from a choppy water surface to electrical energy. At other locations next to rivers, there may be scope to install a waterwheel or a turbine to convert the kinetic energy of flowing water to electrical power. While such locations are no longer available in large cities, some suitable sites might still be available in rural and remote locations to operate a data center. Kinetic Turbines During an earlier era, undershoot waterwheels converted river flow kinetic energy to mechanical power to operate sawmills or to drive milling wheels for grinding wheat into flour. In the modern era, kinetic turbines have replaced the classical waterwheel. While some kinetic turbines are placed on a river floor or seabed, stationery floating structures restrained by cables are able to carry kinetic turbines under the hull. A kinetic turbine tested along the St. Lawrence River southwest of Montreal incurred higher cost for electric power compared to hydroelectric power dams. The river floor installation of the turbine reduced access for maintenance and especially during icy winter months. Floating technology that carried turbines under the hull were tested along the St. Lawrence River, downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam. Counter-rotating pairs of vertical-axis turbines located under the hull, with a flow defector, would place generating technology and main support bearing inside the floating structure, allowing easy access for maintenance and repair. A submerged counter-flow heat exchange unit under the structure would provide cooling during summer weather. During winter, information processing technology would generate enough heat for interior heating. River Requirements Rivers deemed suitable for floating data centers would require the combination of sufficient water flow velocity and sufficient water depth to operate kinetic turbines efficiently. Cables connected to shore or anchored to the river floor would restrain the floating structure either near midstream or near a river bank. A current-driven kinetic ferry would carry employees between river bank and floating data center. An extended floating dock would be an option, as would having the data center floating in the river stream with a telecommunications connection to a land-based office where programming employees work. Suitable Rivers Data centers require a constant and reliable supply of electrical power, from rivers with reliable and steady water flow, with minimal variation in flow velocity and water depth. The East River in New York City is a suitable candidate. While looking like a river and flowing like a river, it is actually an oceanic channel with flow driven by ocean current. Downstream of Niagara Falls, the Niagara River provides steady water depth and steady flow velocity while being close to a large population. At either location, floating docks restrained by cables could provide access between shore and data center. East of Lake Ontario and downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam, water of sufficient depth and velocity flows through the north and south channels of the Upper St Lawrence River. Further east and southwest of Montreal, a section of the St. Lawrence River could sustain operation of a floating data center. Kinetic ferry vessels driven by water current could carry technical personnel between shore and midstream floating data center, and optic telecommunications cable could connect between the data center and shore-based work stations, reducing the number of workers who travel by ferry between shore and data center. Other Rivers Many rivers across North America and internationally offer sufficient water depth and water flow velocity, with near steady year-round steam flow rate to sustain operation of floating data centers. Many such rivers are navigable and transit ships, as is the case of sections of the St. Lawrence River. Ferries operate along the East River of New York City despite the powerful water current. Operation of floating data centers also requires access to a suitably qualified workforce, which is available in New York City, the Niagara region and even along sections of the St Lawrence River. The combination of suitable river characteristics and availability of a suitably qualified workforce would determine future locations of floating data centers. It is uncertain as how to regulatory authorities would classify a floating data center, as it is essentially a vessel with the equivalent of a propeller extending downward under the hull. Conclusions Advances in information processing technology along with the development of advanced programming have increased the need to expand the capabilities of data centers. Data centers consume massive amounts of electrical energy and have massive cooling requirements. A data center that floats on water where powerful currents flow, likely have access to required cooling capacity along with the ability to convert river flow energy into electrical power to sustain data center operation. Some future data centers would likely float on fast flowing rivers that pass near large or through cities.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 21:28:47
Report: Japan’s Mitsui OSK Poised to Order Newbuild Tankers in India,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-japan-s-mitsui-osk-poised-to-order-newbuild-tankers-in-india,,03/09/2025 19:58:07,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which is one of the world’s largest shipowners/operators, told the media in India that it is in discussions to begin building ships at the country’s shipyards as it looks to diversify its sources of newbuilds. The move is in keeping with the Indian government’s efforts to expand the shipbuilding industry into the international market. According to the information supplied during a press briefing, MOL has been exploring the options for shipbuilding in Japan for the past three years, but found the yards lacked capacity. Now with government shipbuilding projects nearing completion, the government’s support, and recent partnerships such as the agreement between Cochin Shipyard and HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering to share expertise, MOL is reported to be in talks with the Indian government and Cochin Shipyard. The Indian government has detailed plans to develop three large shipbuilding clusters as it seeks to expand the industry. It has been courting major Western carriers with discussions reported for new projects with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, and CMA CGM. The container carriers have discussed repair projects as a first step toward building new ships in India. “The plan is to start with simpler vessels, like product tankers, for example, MR tankers, and gradually move towards more complicated ships,” said Captain Anand Jayaraman, South Asia Middle East regional Executive Officer of MOL (India), reports the Indian media outlet ETInfra. The executive reportedly told the media that MOL wants to develop sources beyond China, Korea, and Japan, and within the decade hopes to be able to build Ethane carriers in India. MOL is already the fourth-largest shipping company in India. Out of a total fleet of more than 900 ships, the company has 13 registered in India. The media quotes the captain as saying the company’s goal is to grow to become India’s second-largest shipping company. Shipbuilding is also part of a larger investment planned by MOL into India, including railways and other logistic operations.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 21:28:47
Supervisor Killed at Hanwha Ocean Shipyard During Testing on FPSO,https://maritime-executive.com/article/supervisor-killed-at-hanwha-ocean-shipyard-during-testing-on-fpso,,03/09/2025 19:19:41,,"A supervisor identified as a Brazilian national overseeing construction of an FPSO vessel at the Hanwha Ocean shipyard in Geoje, South Korea, was killed on September 3 during testing on the under-construction vessel. The Coast Guard is reporting that the individual fell from a platform that collapsed while two other individuals clung to the structure and were rescued. Related work at the Hanwha Shipyard was immediately suspended as investigations began into the incident. Korean media reports that the Coast Guard and the Ministry of Employment and Labor are investigating the incident as a possible violation of the Industrial Safety and Health Act. Lift testing was being performed on the 150,000-ton FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) vessel being built for Petrobras. According to the reports, large bags filled with water we being lifted between approximately 11:30 am and noon local time using a winch aboard the vessel designed for lifting heavy objects. The structure holding the winch collapsed under the weight, leaving it bent and hanging down. Report from Korean TV (Click image for video) The supervisor who was on the platform fell more than 30 feet (10 meters) to the water below. The Coast Guard reports he was recovered at approximately 1330 and was in cardiac arrest. He died at a local hospital. The other two individuals were able to hold on to the remaining structure. They are reported to have suffered less serious injuries. South Korea’s unions have complained about unsafe working conditions at all the shipyards. Last year, there was another fatal accident at the Hanwha Ocean shipyard that also resulted in work being suspended. A month later, there was a fatal accident that killed a subcontractor at HD Hyundai’s Ulsan shipyard. This latest incident comes as the shipyards have been involved in prolonged contract negotiations with the unions. Hanwha Ocean reached what it called a major labor deal with its unions in late July. The unions, however, have been calling for strikes at HD Hyundai’s shipyards as they demand better wages and working conditions, and now are also protesting the planned merger of HHI’s yard in Ulsan with the Hyundai Mipo shipyard.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 21:28:47
Wreck of WWI U-Boat Raised From the Wadden Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wreck-of-wwi-u-boat-raised-from-the-wadden-sea,,03/09/2025 06:07:37,,"After a challenging salvage operation, the Dutch crane vessel Matador 3 has raised part of the German WWI-era submarine U16 from the waters off Germany's North Sea coast. It is unusual for a wreck of this vintage to be raised to the surface, but despite its rarity, the salvors do not have plans to preserve it. U16 was built in 1911 and fought throughout World War I, sinking nearly 30 vessels and surviving about one dozen combat patrols. The vessel went down in 1919 off the coast of Scharhorn, a German-administered island at the mouth of the Elbe. At the time of the sub's loss, it was under way on a delivery voyage to Britain, where it was to be handed over as part of Germany's postwar reparations. All crewmembers are believed to have survived the sinking. (A local historian, Jann M. Witt, told Tageblatt that it is likely that they scuttled their sub rather than hand it over to the British; another German sub met with the same fate earlier that year.) The wreck stayed at the bottom of the North Sea for more than 100 years before the decision was made to remove it. It has been surveyed more than once, and the latest visit was in 2023, when a vessel of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) passed over the site. The sub's wreckage is within the Elbe federal waterway, according to NDR, and belongs to the Federal Directorate of Waterways and Shipping (WSV). It is not considered a protected war grave for legal purposes. The wreck's other half sits at a depth of about 60 feet of water, and is slated for removal this week, weather permitting. The wreckage itself is likely headed for demolition, despite the WSV's early attempts to find a new home for it. Parts of the sub may be preserved by German museums, but none have stepped forward to take the entirety of the wreck, NDR reports.",Maritime Executive,03/09/2025 21:28:47

"Q&A: Kathy Metcalf, President Emeritus, Chamber of Shipping of America",https://maritime-executive.com/article/q-a-kathy-metcalf-president-emeritus-chamber-of-shipping-of-america,,04/09/2025 03:24:17,,"Kathy Metcalf has been a trailblazer from the moment she walked through Vickery Gate at Kings Point as a member of the first coed class of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. That was 51 years ago. Since then, she has sailed aboard oil tankers for Gulf and Sunoco, come shoreside with Sunoco as a regulatory and government affairs official, earned a law degree at night from Widener University and in 1997 accepted an invitation from Joe Cox, the long-time President & CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA), to join the Chamber as Director of Maritime Affairs. Eighteen years later, in 2015, she succeeded Cox as President & CEO of CSA. At each step of the way, she's demonstrated that the maritime industry is not just a ""man's world"" and that there's plenty of room for women too. Not that she wanted any special treatment, just a fair shot. And she has excelled at every stage of the journey with her common-sense intelligence, interpersonal skills, quick wit and sense of fairness. In July, Kathy stepped down as President & CEO and handed the reins to her more-than-capable #2, Sean Kline. She will stay on as President Emeritus, working with CSA members on technical and regulatory issues. ""It's not 'goodbye,'"" she says, ""but 'see ya around.'"" Welcome, Kathy! We're so honored to have you. Tell our readers more about yourself. What attracted you to the maritime industry? It was a bit of a circuitous route. I originally wanted to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and received nominations to West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy. I was, alas, born too soon and received letters from all three explaining that they were not accepting women for the incoming classes in 1972. Changing direction, I attended the University of Delaware for two years and in the fall of my second year received a call on my dorm phone (yes, it really was a pay phone) from a young Senator from Delaware by the name of Joe Biden. He explained to me that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy was accepting women in the summer of 1974 and asked if I was interested. My parents and I visited Kings Point the following weekend, and I made the decision to enter in that first class with women in the summer of 1974 and graduated in 1978. I will always be grateful to Senator Biden for giving me this incredible opportunity. My intention was to go active-duty Navy upon graduation, but during my time at Kings Point I realized what a great industry this is and have stayed in it for 51 years. Remarkable! You then sailed for a while. Were there lessons at sea that transferred to your shore jobs? Lessons learned during my sailing days helped provide me with the confidence and judgment to tackle whatever new challenges lay ahead. They also endowed me with a mariner's perspective of ship operations, which is critical for a successful move to shoreside management positions. Throughout my shoreside career which included obtaining a law degree, I've always been a mariner first and have taken that perspective into account, recognizing that the linchpin to any successful shipping endeavor are the mariners that make it happen. Excellent! Tell our readers about the Chamber of Shipping of America. What does it do and what is its history? The Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA) is the U.S. national shipowners association. For over 100 years, it's represented the interests of shipowners, operators and charterers in the U.S. and internationally at IMO and ILO. Our members own/operate/charter all types of vessels, both U.S. and non-U.S. flagged, engaged in the U.S. domestic and international trades, and we represent them before legislative and regulatory bodies. Our primary focus is to advise them on current compliance challenges as well as future compliance issues coming down the road. What are some of those issues? There are many, but the most important are the global move toward decarbonization of the shipping industry, the risks to shipping from geopolitical challenges (Ukraine/Russia, Middle East), global trade issues including the U.S. Trade Representative's proposal to impose port fees on certain vessels, cybersecurity and simply keeping up to date on new requirements imposed on shipping at the global, national and, in some cases, sub-national levels. What's the relationship between CSA and the International Chamber of Shipping in London? CSA is a founding member of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and serves as the U.S. representative on all ICS bodies including the Board of Directors, the Marine Committee, the Maritime Law Committee and the Shipping Policy Committee. CSA also serves on the ICS delegation to IMO meetings. We collaborate on a number of issues at IMO and in the U.S. impacting the industry. You must be excited about the SHIPS for America Act and the Trump Administration's commitment to ""Making Maritime Great Again."" Absolutely! I remember in 1978, when I graduated from Kings Point, there were hundreds of U.S.-flag vessels trading internationally. Over the last five decades, we've allowed our commercial shipbuilding and U.S.-flag international fleet to shrink to unacceptable levels as regards national and economic security – due principally to neglect. With thanks to the President, Senators Mark Kelly and Todd Young and Representatives Trent Kelly and John Garamendi, the industry is in the first stages of revitalization. It took us a long time to get to where we are now, and it will take some time to bring the industry back. What is desperately needed is a leader (champion!) who can bring all these stakeholders and programs together across the legislative and executive branches and that position, in my opinion, needs to be in the White House. What will it take to make the dream of a 250-vessel fleet a reality? That's a tough one to answer. We obviously need more U.S. shipyards, shipyard workers and ultimately more mariners to man these vessels. Less obvious, but just as important, is the need to create a business environment where U.S. shipyards and U.S.-flag vessels can compete in the international marketplace. This will likely be accomplished through a combination of public funding (subsidies in one form or another) and private sector investment. Ultimately, we need cargo. All these new ships and mariners won't make a difference if the cargo isn't there! Where will the mariners come from? How can we make maritime a more attractive career choice for the next generation? We've been trying to address this challenge for years. First, we need a comprehensive outreach program that makes the general public aware of just how important the commercial maritime industry is to our national economy and security. Second, we need an equally comprehensive outreach program for kids in middle school through high school to introduce them to the opportunities in the maritime industry. And third, we're losing maritime academy graduates to the tech sector in significant numbers and have to figure out a way to make maritime jobs more attractive. Salaries between the maritime and tech industries are comparable, but tech doesn't require you to be away from home and family for six months of the year. What is the future of the Jones Act? Will it have to be modified in some way to accommodate the new push? CSA supports the Jones Act in its current form. Keep in mind that the SHIPS for America Act is focused on building the U.S.-flag internationally trading fleet, so I don't see what modifications would be necessary since the U.S. build requirement would not apply to U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international trade. This allows for the reflagging of foreign-built vessels into the U.S. flag international fleet. You've been a trailblazer – a woman in a man's world – your entire life. What's it been like? How do you see the future of women in maritime? I've never seen myself as a trailblazer. I was just a lucky person who happened to be in the right place at the right time. All I wanted was a fair chance to succeed in a career that at the time had very few women. I got that fair chance, and it was up to me to take advantage of the opportunities before me. I could not have succeeded without my brothers (and sisters) at Kings Point and later in the industry that provided support and encouragement. From my perspective, success is not the result of one person's efforts. It's about your efforts and how you interact with the good people around you, including family, friends and professional colleagues. Are you a member of WISTA, the Women's International Shipping & Trading Association? I am a proud member of WISTA U.S.! WISTA is a unique organization that is obviously focused on women in the maritime industry but has grown to be much more than that. WISTA Sistas have welcomed WISTA Mistas, and the support, collaboration and friendships are unmatched by any other organization in which I have participated. Wonderful! Any final message for our readers? As someone in the latter stages of her career, I would like to send a message to the new generation of maritime professionals, including those in their early years at the academies: Make a plan with a pencil and eraser. The key to progress in life and in your career is how you adapt to change and react to new and unplanned opportunities.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 04:26:53
Salvors Narrowly Avert a Capsizing After Trawler Burns at Pier in Ribeira,https://maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-narrowly-avert-a-capsizing-after-trawler-burns-at-dock-in-ribeira,,04/09/2025 00:27:16,,"Salvors have successfully prevented the capsizing of a trawler at the port of Ribeira, Galicia, limiting the impact from a severe onboard fire. At about 1630 hours on Monday afternoon, the Mauritanian-flagged fishing vessel Awadi caught fire alongside the pier in Barbanza, Galicia. The blaze started in a hold, where maintenance work was under way. A bystander reported the incident to local emergency responders, and shoreside fire teams began work to suppress the blaze and prevent the risk of spreading the fire to nearby ships. No injuries were reported on board. The response effort drew in five fire trucks and crews from around the region, as well as coast guard and environmental agency representatives. Efforts to control the spread of the blaze on board were not successful, and it expanded through multiple compartments.

En breve incorporarse ao operativo o Ría de Vigo. pic.twitter.com/OOAijkZEim The team brought aboard bilge pumps to evacuate firefighting water, as the Awadi had begun to take on a list, according to local media. By late Tuesday, it was listing 40 degrees to starboard, and salvors began working to find the cause. It turned out that the bilge system for the hold was admitting water into the compartment, according to Diario de Arousa, so divers were sent below to plug it and halt the water ingress. Firefighters also removed all of their own gear and all of the stores from the weather deck in order to improve the vessel's stability, and they reduced the amount of water they were introducing inside the ship. The list has stabilized but the fire is still smoldering, port director Juan Sanmartin told local media, adding that it will likely continue to do so for several days until the flammable stores inside the vessel are consumed. So far, no pollution has been reported, but the ship has 18,000 liters of diesel on board and will need to be defueled. Once the emergency response is fully completed and the fire is out, an investigation into the cause of the casualty will begin. Port officials say that a stray welding spark may have started the fire, a constant risk during repair periods.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 04:26:53
Russian Union Wins Compensation for Death Aboard a Sanctioned Tanker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/russian-union-wins-compensation-for-death-aboard-a-sanctioned-tanker,,03/09/2025 23:41:06,,"The Russian Seafarers' Union (SUR) has begun publicizing cases of labor rights enforcement against ""shadow fleet"" tankers, the lightly-regulated and questionably-insured vessels that carry most of Russia's oil to market. The calibrated ""price cap"" G7 sanction regime has restricted Russia's access to Western tanker owners and insurers, creating business opportunities for anonymous players who operate along the edges of maritime law and practice - and are occasionally caught shorting their seafarers. Last month, the SUR reported that it had secured the detention of the tanker Unity, a sanctioned vessel owned in Moscow and managed in the UAE. Russian enforcement actions against the Russia-facing shadow fleet are rare, but SUR convinced the port captain in Murmansk to detain Unity for multiple violations, including an estimated $90,000 in unpaid back wages. The vessel had just changed legal owner, flag state and insurer, and the crew were concerned that their employment contracts would not be honored. On Monday, the SUR reported that its Black Sea branch had pursued compensation for the death of a second engineer aboard the tanker Sun (IMO 9293117). Like many shadow fleet vessels, Sun ""did not have a valid insurance policy,"" and the owner refused to pay any compensation to the seafarer's family. ""Not only was the amount of compensation for death not specified in the contract, but there was no information about insurance at all. In addition, it turned out that the insurance policy on the tanker was invalid,"" union official Alexey Belyakov reported. The union got involved in the matter at the family's request, and it reached out to the flag registry of Antigua and Barbuda. However, the registry said that Sun was no longer flagged in Antigua, so it could not assist. Sun's paperwork now declares that it is flagged in Benin, but shipping database Equasis records that this declaration is false - a common shadow fleet practice. Without help from the insurer or the flag state, the SUR reached out to Sun's owner. By the union's account, the shipowner ignored all requests and only got in touch when the union contacted the flag state. Then the owner brought in Turkish lawyers to negotiate, without success. At last, a representative of the shipowner in Russia joined the negotiations, and the SUR settled on a final payment of $125,000 for the family. In a statement, the union cautioned seafarers to read their employment contracts carefully before signing, with particular attention to insurance and medical care - and to contact their union for advice if there are red flags.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 04:26:53
IUMI: EV Fires Can Cause Explosions on Ro/Ros,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iumi-ev-fires-can-cause-explosions-on-ro-ros,,03/09/2025 22:56:53,,"The International Union of Marine Insurers has updated its guidance to warn that PCTC and ropax operators run a risk of explosion during an onboard EV fire, a previously underexamined problem. Electric vehicle fires have been a major source of concern for ro/ro operators for years, and several operators have banned them from carriage. EV battery packs can self-ignite if cells overheat or develop internal faults; they can also catch fire from a nearby heat source, like a burning conventional vehicle. Once EV batteries enter thermal runaway, they burn at high temperature and are difficult to permanently extinguish. They also emit large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes, making hand-to-hand firefighting with a hose team even more challenging in the tight spaces of a full ro/ro deck. The industry has adapted its firefighting practices to account for the realities of EV blazes, and operators now favor shutting off ventilation and flooding the affected hold with the fixed CO2 system. This is IUMI's recommendation as well, and the organization recommends that ""fixed firefighting systems should be applied early, correctly and safely first rather than manual firefighting."" The ""early"" component of this advice is essential, IUMI says, because waiting could allow the blaze to grow to the point that the fixed system gets disabled by the fire or gets overwhelmed, with potentially catastrophic consequences. But this comes with its own risk, according to IUMI. At the right concentrations, the gases that are emitted from an EV battery pack are potentially explosive in combination with ambient atmosphere. Research suggests that the gas mix from an EV fire includes 30 percent hydrogen, which has high explosion potential. If these gases accumulate in an enclosed space without burning off, and mix with air in the right percentage, a blast could occur. Since the traditional fixed firefighting sequence starts with a full ventilation shutdown, before any CO2 is introduced, any gases from the fire would be trapped inside with air only for a period. ""A comprehensive firefighting strategy must not only consider the firefighting itself but also the management of potentially explosive gases that may accumulate during such incidents. The aim must be to integrate both aspects, firefighting and ventilation operation, without limiting the effectiveness of the overall firefighting system,"" IUMI cautioned. ""Careful consideration should be given by shipowners to appropriate ventilation procedures for the extinguishing system installed and the vessel concerned."" Modern PCTCs have another hazard that inverts typical thinking on marine firefighting. With their wide-open deck layouts, newer PCTCs have no partitions from the starboard bulkhead all the way across to the port side. In addition to the implications for ease of spreading fire, the design creates unique stability considerations. Getting the deck wet - even a little bit - can reduce the friction between car tires and deck surface enough that it creates the risk of a catastrophic cargo shift from one side to the other. If the lashings aren't enough to hold the vehicles in place, the PCTIC could take on a heavy list, with potentially serious consequences. This means that by and large, hose teams for boundary cooling are a restricted option on a PCTC. ""Only in calm weather (without swell and wind waves) locally applied small amounts of water can be recommended"" for boundary cooling on a PCTC deck, IUMI recommends.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 04:26:53
Canada Moves its Coast Guard Into its Defense Ministry,https://maritime-executive.com/article/canada-moves-coast-guard-out-of-regulatory-agency-into-defense-ministry,,03/09/2025 21:40:21,,"The Canadian Coast Guard has formally transferred out of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and into Canada's national defense establishment, expanding its role and adjusting its orientation. The transition brings the CCG's maritime domain experience into the mission of defending Canadian sovereignty, Canada's government said in a statement, much like the U.S. Coast Guard model. Some elements from Fisheries and Oceans Canada are also making the switch. The integration is intended to increase information-sharing and coordination between the CCG, Canada's Department of National Defense and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) - but, unlike the USCG, the CCG will remain a civilian agency rather than a military branch. ""There are no plans to arm CCG personnel or assets, or to incorporate an additional enforcement role in the organization. The CCG will continue to deliver the essential services on which Canadians rely, including search and rescue, icebreaking, environmental conservation and protection, safe navigation, and supporting ocean science,"" said Minister of National Defense David McGuinty in a statement. A new bill before Canada's parliament would expand the CCG's national security role somewhat further, if passed. The Stronger Borders Act proposes to add (among other measures) maritime domain awareness responsibilities for the CCG, especially in the Canadian Arctic. In an era of increasing competition in the Arctic, and with the Northwest Passage increasingly accessible, tasking additional assets for monitoring in the remote far north could have security benefits. In the last election round earlier this year, Canada's Liberal party pledged to prepare the Canadian Coast guard for MDA activities and make it ready to support NATO operations. By doing so, Canada will now apply its existing coast guard spending towards its NATO defense spending target; Canada has long fallen short of the NATO readiness contribution target, which was set at two percent of GDP in 2014 and is now set to rise to five percent by 2035.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 04:26:53

"Rubio: Military Strikes on Suspected Drug Boats ""Will Happen Again""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/rubio-military-strikes-on-suspected-drug-boats-will-happen-again,,04/09/2025 02:56:45,,"The Trump administration plans to keep attacking drug boats with lethal military force, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday. ""The United States has long — for many, many years — established intelligence that allowed us to interdict and stop drug boats. And we did that. And it doesn’t work. Interdiction doesn’t work,"" Rubio said at a press conference in Mexico City. ""What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them."" The administration has deployed a large task force to waters of the southern Caribbean, and is testing a new, militarized approach to trafficking enforcement. On Tuesday, the White House announced that a boat allegedly transporting narcotics off Venezuela had been eliminated in a strike; 11 suspects were killed, the administration said, and no survivors were reported. According to the White House, the boat was transporting drugs for the Tren de Aragua gang, designated by the Trump administration as a foreign terrorist organization. Rubio said Tuesday that the vessel was likely headed to Trinidad or another country in the Caribbean. He expressed certainty that the drugs were headed for the United States; the same route is also commonly used on the circuitous drug pipeline to European markets, where cocaine fetches a higher value. The president personally authorized the attack on the suspect boat, Rubio told reporters. ""On the president’s orders, we blew it up. And it will happen again,"" Rubio said. ""Maybe it’s happening right now. I don’t know."" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sounded a similar note in an interview on Fox and Friends. ""This is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won’t stop with just this strike,"" he said. Reactions to the new approach have been mixed. Many legal experts suggest that executing suspects on the high seas without a boarding or a trial may expose the administration to war crimes charges, particularly if done for an offense that is not normally punishable by death. ""Destroying a boat at sea without boarding or verifying opens the door to tragedy,"" said Juan S. Gonzalez, former senior director of the National Security Council under former President Joe Biden. ""The USCG - not the Navy - is the right tool for counter-narcotics in the Caribbean."" However, some regional leaders are all too happy to see a new emphasis on lethality in countering the drug trade at sea. Military methods are already common for shoreside counternarcotics agencies in Latin America, matching the militarized nature of the cartels. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, said Tuesday that she supported the Trump administration's new approach. ""The pain and suffering the cartels have inflicted on our nation is immense. I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,"" she said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03
Zelim Urges Use of Situational Awareness Technology to Prevent Collisions,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/zelim-urges-use-of-situational-awareness-technology-to-prevent-collisions,,04/09/2025 02:51:49,,"[By: Zelim] Zelim, the Edinburgh-headquartered maritime safety and security innovator, is calling for the mandatory adoption of advanced situational awareness technology to help prevent ship collisions, reduce fatalities, and improve operational safety at sea. The call follows the recent publication of the Marine Accident Investigations Board’s (MAIB) 2024 Annual Report, which noted: “We need to radically rethink the role of human watchkeepers in the digital age. Humans do not make good monitors and if under-stimulated, they will find other things to occupy themselves.” This was also reinforced in MAIB's preliminary report on the Solong and Stena Immaculate incident in the North Sea, where the lack of real-time situational awareness contributed to the severity of events. On 10 March 2025, the Portugal-registered container ship MV Solong collided with the anchored oil tanker Stena Immaculate near the Humber Estuary, rupturing a cargo tank and triggering a major fire. Thirty-six crew were rescued; one seafarer remains missing and presumed dead. Zelim CEO, Sam Mayall, said: “We wholeheartedly support the MAIB’s position on this. By combining AI-powered cameras and real-time alerting, advanced technologies such as our ZOE system can help crews act faster, prevent incidents from escalating, and provide trusted records post-event. Beyond preventing collisions and man-overboard incidents, these systems can also provide critical forensic data to support investigations and regulatory compliance. Crucially, today’s situational awareness technology reduces reliance on human vigilance alone, allowing crews to focus where their judgment and experience matter most.” India has already taken decisive action to reduce the risk of collision and lives lost to man-overboard incidents. Earlier this year, its Directorate General of Shipping mandated CCTV systems on all domestic vessels of 500 GT and above, with full implementation required by 2028. The regulation specifies comprehensive camera placement, resolution standards, and integration with AI-based monitoring. It is designed not just for surveillance, but for proactive detection, tracking, and alerting to protect lives at sea. “Voluntary measures are no longer enough. To strengthen safety and security at sea, global regulators must follow India’s lead and mandate advanced situational awareness solutions. Smarter ships result in safer sea,” added Mayall.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03

Glamox Provides Advanced Helicopter Landing Systems for Royal Navy Warships,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/glamox-provides-advanced-helicopter-landing-systems-for-royal-navy-warships,,04/09/2025 01:11:44,,"[By: Glamox] Glamox, a world leader in lighting, has enhanced the capabilities of the Royal Navy’s Offshore Patrol Vessels, HMS Trent and HMS Spey, to land helicopters on a moving deck in challenging weather and during night conditions. HMS Trent was the first vessel to be equipped with the advanced Helicopter Visual Landing Aid System (HVLAS), which underwent rigorous testing off the English south coast in July, involving three days of day and night landings from a Wildcat helicopter. HMS Spey is the next in line to be fitted with the system. Additionally, Glamox supplied both vessels with military-grade Night Vision Imaging System navigation lights. The HVLAS is a comprehensive flight deck-based lighting system that provides pilots with visual cues and information during approach and landing. It includes a stabilised horizon bar that shows pilots the position of the horizon, regardless of the roll and pitch of the vessel. A glide path indicator assists pilots in judging approach angles using a three-colour light beam to show the correct path or whether the helicopter is too high or too low. Additional deck-edge lighting and focused LED beam lines provide accurate positional cues for pilots operating in low-visibility conditions or using night vision goggles. See the video. The lighting system includes controls to dim or adjust the lighting intensity for improved visibility. This means that the ship can support covert missions, operating in near-dark conditions, and the lighting can be tuned to meet the operational requirements of helicopters from other forces. “The fact that we now have the ability to control our lights in such a different manner will mean that the ability for partner nations to land helicopters will be significantly easier,” said Lieutenant Harry Jukes, HMS Trent’s Weapon Engineer Officer, interviewed by the British Forces Broadcast Service. Following HMS Trent’s refit in Malta and the successful validation of the system at sea, the vessel is expected to be deployed to the Caribbean, where it can support various missions from counter-narcotics to humanitarian aid. The HVLAS for HMS Spey will be fitted in Singapore during its scheduled maintenance period. The Royal Navy has a further three Batch 2 River Class Offshore Patrol Vessels that could benefit from the system. “This is the first time that Royal Navy Ships have had an HVLAS retrofit, and we are delighted with the results. The new technology greatly extends the capabilities of the Offshore Patrol Vessels to conduct helicopter operations at night and in bad weather conditions,” said Ronny Orvik, head of Glamox’s Defence & Security business. “Furthermore, this major update underscores the value of the Defence Equipment & Support arm of the UK’s Ministry of Defence in keeping its ships at the forefront of advanced technology.”",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03
U.S. Coast Guard Keeps Close Watch on Chinese Icebreakers off Alaska,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-keeps-close-watch-on-chinese-icebreakers-off-alaska,,04/09/2025 00:10:49,,"The U.S. Coast Guard has been closely watching China's Arctic research flotilla for the past month, and continues to monitor the operations of two Chinese-flagged vessels in waters of the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf - outside the bounds of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, but inside the limits of U.S. seabed mineral claims. The medium icebreaker USCGC Healy has been operating in the region to provide presence and surveillance, and for the last week, Healy's crew has been monitoring the movements of the Soviet-built icebreaking tug Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di (flagged with the Liberian registry) and the brand new ice-class research vessel Jidi. Both were encountered in an area of the ECS about 200-250 nautical miles to the north of Utqiagvik, Alaska, a small coastal village on the Beaufort Sea. On Tuesday, USCGC Healy - supported by a Hercules long-range SAR aircraft out of Air Station Kodiak - responded to intercept Jidi, and the crew monitored and queried the vessel. Healy intercepted Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di on Sunday. “This operation highlights the value of our ice-capable fleet,” said Rear Adm. Bob Little, commander, U.S. Coast Guard Arctic District. “The U.S. Coast Guard is controlling, securing, and defending the northern U.S. border and maritime approaches in the Arctic to protect U.S. sovereignty, and Healy’s operations demonstrate the critical need for more Coast Guard icebreakers to achieve that.” Healy is one of the Coast Guard's two purpose-built oceangoing icebreakers. The ""interim icebreaker"" USCGC Storis, which began life as an offshore vessel and is currently operated by a civilian merchant mariner crew, is nearby in the Bering Sea. USCGC Waesche, a National Security Cutter, is also in the region and has accompanied Healy for part of the mission. In addition to Jidi and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di, the flotilla of Chinese vessels recently spotted in the far north includes the Polar Class 3 icebreaker Xue Long 2; the new research vessel Tan Suo San Hao; and the Shen Hai Yi Hao, a conventional research vessel built to carry a deep-diving submersible. In response to the increasing competition in the Arctic, the Trump administration is giving the Coast Guard more resources to expand its presence. With U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funding, it is expanding the small port of Nome, Alaska at the north end of the Bering Sea, specifically to accommodate Coast Guard icebreakers. And to expand the icebreaking fleet, the administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains $4.3 billion to pay for the service's future heavy icebreaker series, the Polar Security Cutter, plus $3.5 billion more for a medium icebreaker series.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03
"Q&A: Kathy Metcalf, President Emeritus, Chamber of Shipping of America",https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/q-a-kathy-metcalf-president-emeritus-chamber-of-shipping-of-america,,03/09/2025 23:24:17,,"Kathy Metcalf has been a trailblazer from the moment she walked through Vickery Gate at Kings Point as a member of the first coed class of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. That was 51 years ago. Since then, she has sailed aboard oil tankers for Gulf and Sunoco, come shoreside with Sunoco as a regulatory and government affairs official, earned a law degree at night from Widener University and in 1997 accepted an invitation from Joe Cox, the long-time President & CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA), to join the Chamber as Director of Maritime Affairs. Eighteen years later, in 2015, she succeeded Cox as President & CEO of CSA. At each step of the way, she's demonstrated that the maritime industry is not just a ""man's world"" and that there's plenty of room for women too. Not that she wanted any special treatment, just a fair shot. And she has excelled at every stage of the journey with her common-sense intelligence, interpersonal skills, quick wit and sense of fairness. In July, Kathy stepped down as President & CEO and handed the reins to her more-than-capable #2, Sean Kline. She will stay on as President Emeritus, working with CSA members on technical and regulatory issues. ""It's not 'goodbye,'"" she says, ""but 'see ya around.'"" Welcome, Kathy! We're so honored to have you. Tell our readers more about yourself. What attracted you to the maritime industry? It was a bit of a circuitous route. I originally wanted to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and received nominations to West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy. I was, alas, born too soon and received letters from all three explaining that they were not accepting women for the incoming classes in 1972. Changing direction, I attended the University of Delaware for two years and in the fall of my second year received a call on my dorm phone (yes, it really was a pay phone) from a young Senator from Delaware by the name of Joe Biden. He explained to me that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy was accepting women in the summer of 1974 and asked if I was interested. My parents and I visited Kings Point the following weekend, and I made the decision to enter in that first class with women in the summer of 1974 and graduated in 1978. I will always be grateful to Senator Biden for giving me this incredible opportunity. My intention was to go active-duty Navy upon graduation, but during my time at Kings Point I realized what a great industry this is and have stayed in it for 51 years. Remarkable! You then sailed for a while. Were there lessons at sea that transferred to your shore jobs? Lessons learned during my sailing days helped provide me with the confidence and judgment to tackle whatever new challenges lay ahead. They also endowed me with a mariner's perspective of ship operations, which is critical for a successful move to shoreside management positions. Throughout my shoreside career which included obtaining a law degree, I've always been a mariner first and have taken that perspective into account, recognizing that the linchpin to any successful shipping endeavor are the mariners that make it happen. Excellent! Tell our readers about the Chamber of Shipping of America. What does it do and what is its history? The Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA) is the U.S. national shipowners association. For over 100 years, it's represented the interests of shipowners, operators and charterers in the U.S. and internationally at IMO and ILO. Our members own/operate/charter all types of vessels, both U.S. and non-U.S. flagged, engaged in the U.S. domestic and international trades, and we represent them before legislative and regulatory bodies. Our primary focus is to advise them on current compliance challenges as well as future compliance issues coming down the road. What are some of those issues? There are many, but the most important are the global move toward decarbonization of the shipping industry, the risks to shipping from geopolitical challenges (Ukraine/Russia, Middle East), global trade issues including the U.S. Trade Representative's proposal to impose port fees on certain vessels, cybersecurity and simply keeping up to date on new requirements imposed on shipping at the global, national and, in some cases, sub-national levels. What's the relationship between CSA and the International Chamber of Shipping in London? CSA is a founding member of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and serves as the U.S. representative on all ICS bodies including the Board of Directors, the Marine Committee, the Maritime Law Committee and the Shipping Policy Committee. CSA also serves on the ICS delegation to IMO meetings. We collaborate on a number of issues at IMO and in the U.S. impacting the industry. You must be excited about the SHIPS for America Act and the Trump Administration's commitment to ""Making Maritime Great Again."" Absolutely! I remember in 1978, when I graduated from Kings Point, there were hundreds of U.S.-flag vessels trading internationally. Over the last five decades, we've allowed our commercial shipbuilding and U.S.-flag international fleet to shrink to unacceptable levels as regards national and economic security – due principally to neglect. With thanks to the President, Senators Mark Kelly and Todd Young and Representatives Trent Kelly and John Garamendi, the industry is in the first stages of revitalization. It took us a long time to get to where we are now, and it will take some time to bring the industry back. What is desperately needed is a leader (champion!) who can bring all these stakeholders and programs together across the legislative and executive branches and that position, in my opinion, needs to be in the White House. What will it take to make the dream of a 250-vessel fleet a reality? That's a tough one to answer. We obviously need more U.S. shipyards, shipyard workers and ultimately more mariners to man these vessels. Less obvious, but just as important, is the need to create a business environment where U.S. shipyards and U.S.-flag vessels can compete in the international marketplace. This will likely be accomplished through a combination of public funding (subsidies in one form or another) and private sector investment. Ultimately, we need cargo. All these new ships and mariners won't make a difference if the cargo isn't there! Where will the mariners come from? How can we make maritime a more attractive career choice for the next generation? We've been trying to address this challenge for years. First, we need a comprehensive outreach program that makes the general public aware of just how important the commercial maritime industry is to our national economy and security. Second, we need an equally comprehensive outreach program for kids in middle school through high school to introduce them to the opportunities in the maritime industry. And third, we're losing maritime academy graduates to the tech sector in significant numbers and have to figure out a way to make maritime jobs more attractive. Salaries between the maritime and tech industries are comparable, but tech doesn't require you to be away from home and family for six months of the year. What is the future of the Jones Act? Will it have to be modified in some way to accommodate the new push? CSA supports the Jones Act in its current form. Keep in mind that the SHIPS for America Act is focused on building the U.S.-flag internationally trading fleet, so I don't see what modifications would be necessary since the U.S. build requirement would not apply to U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international trade. This allows for the reflagging of foreign-built vessels into the U.S. flag international fleet. You've been a trailblazer – a woman in a man's world – your entire life. What's it been like? How do you see the future of women in maritime? I've never seen myself as a trailblazer. I was just a lucky person who happened to be in the right place at the right time. All I wanted was a fair chance to succeed in a career that at the time had very few women. I got that fair chance, and it was up to me to take advantage of the opportunities before me. I could not have succeeded without my brothers (and sisters) at Kings Point and later in the industry that provided support and encouragement. From my perspective, success is not the result of one person's efforts. It's about your efforts and how you interact with the good people around you, including family, friends and professional colleagues. Are you a member of WISTA, the Women's International Shipping & Trading Association? I am a proud member of WISTA U.S.! WISTA is a unique organization that is obviously focused on women in the maritime industry but has grown to be much more than that. WISTA Sistas have welcomed WISTA Mistas, and the support, collaboration and friendships are unmatched by any other organization in which I have participated. Wonderful! Any final message for our readers? As someone in the latter stages of her career, I would like to send a message to the new generation of maritime professionals, including those in their early years at the academies: Make a plan with a pencil and eraser. The key to progress in life and in your career is how you adapt to change and react to new and unplanned opportunities.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03
Floating Data Centers on Fast-Flowing Rivers,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/floating-data-centers-on-fast-flowing-rivers,,03/09/2025 16:15:19,,"Advances in information processing technology and programming have increased the need for data centers capable of processing massive volumes of information. Data centers that float on water provide ready access to cooling capacity, with potential to convert the energy from sea waves and river currents to electrical energy to operate the onboard technology. Introduction Data centers process massive amounts of information and require continuous and reliable access to large amounts of electric power and substantial cooling capacity. When located on land in arid regions where solar photovoltaic energy is available, data centers require roof-mounted air-cooling technology that consumes massive amounts of electrical power. While waterfront coastal locations provide easy and available access to water cooling, market demand for such locations is very high, with high real estate prices. A cubic volume of water can provide over 3,400 times the thermal capacity of an identical cubic volume of air. Even in warm climates, the temperature of coastal seawater and river water is often cooler than air temperature. At locations where winds blow constantly, wind energy generates waves. It is possible for some technologies to convert energy from a choppy water surface to electrical energy. At other locations next to rivers, there may be scope to install a waterwheel or a turbine to convert the kinetic energy of flowing water to electrical power. While such locations are no longer available in large cities, some suitable sites might still be available in rural and remote locations to operate a data center. Kinetic Turbines During an earlier era, undershoot waterwheels converted river flow kinetic energy to mechanical power to operate sawmills or to drive milling wheels for grinding wheat into flour. In the modern era, kinetic turbines have replaced the classical waterwheel. While some kinetic turbines are placed on a river floor or seabed, stationery floating structures restrained by cables are able to carry kinetic turbines under the hull. A kinetic turbine tested along the St. Lawrence River southwest of Montreal incurred higher cost for electric power compared to hydroelectric power dams. The river floor installation of the turbine reduced access for maintenance and especially during icy winter months. Floating technology that carried turbines under the hull were tested along the St. Lawrence River, downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam. Counter-rotating pairs of vertical-axis turbines located under the hull, with a flow defector, would place generating technology and main support bearing inside the floating structure, allowing easy access for maintenance and repair. A submerged counter-flow heat exchange unit under the structure would provide cooling during summer weather. During winter, information processing technology would generate enough heat for interior heating. River Requirements Rivers deemed suitable for floating data centers would require the combination of sufficient water flow velocity and sufficient water depth to operate kinetic turbines efficiently. Cables connected to shore or anchored to the river floor would restrain the floating structure either near midstream or near a river bank. A current-driven kinetic ferry would carry employees between river bank and floating data center. An extended floating dock would be an option, as would having the data center floating in the river stream with a telecommunications connection to a land-based office where programming employees work. Suitable Rivers Data centers require a constant and reliable supply of electrical power, from rivers with reliable and steady water flow, with minimal variation in flow velocity and water depth. The East River in New York City is a suitable candidate. While looking like a river and flowing like a river, it is actually an oceanic channel with flow driven by ocean current. Downstream of Niagara Falls, the Niagara River provides steady water depth and steady flow velocity while being close to a large population. At either location, floating docks restrained by cables could provide access between shore and data center. East of Lake Ontario and downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam, water of sufficient depth and velocity flows through the north and south channels of the Upper St Lawrence River. Further east and southwest of Montreal, a section of the St. Lawrence River could sustain operation of a floating data center. Kinetic ferry vessels driven by water current could carry technical personnel between shore and midstream floating data center, and optic telecommunications cable could connect between the data center and shore-based work stations, reducing the number of workers who travel by ferry between shore and data center. Other Rivers Many rivers across North America and internationally offer sufficient water depth and water flow velocity, with near steady year-round steam flow rate to sustain operation of floating data centers. Many such rivers are navigable and transit ships, as is the case of sections of the St. Lawrence River. Ferries operate along the East River of New York City despite the powerful water current. Operation of floating data centers also requires access to a suitably qualified workforce, which is available in New York City, the Niagara region and even along sections of the St Lawrence River. The combination of suitable river characteristics and availability of a suitably qualified workforce would determine future locations of floating data centers. It is uncertain as how to regulatory authorities would classify a floating data center, as it is essentially a vessel with the equivalent of a propeller extending downward under the hull. Conclusions Advances in information processing technology along with the development of advanced programming have increased the need to expand the capabilities of data centers. Data centers consume massive amounts of electrical energy and have massive cooling requirements. A data center that floats on water where powerful currents flow, likely have access to required cooling capacity along with the ability to convert river flow energy into electrical power to sustain data center operation. Some future data centers would likely float on fast flowing rivers that pass near large or through cities.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03
The CyberBoat Challenge: Cybersecurity Education for the MTS,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/the-cyberboat-challenge-cybersecurity-education-for-the-mts,,03/09/2025 01:00:17,,"The information security industry has lamented the lack of available skilled and talented workers for the last three decades. A common estimate today is that there are a million unfilled cybersecurity-related positions in the U.S. alone. The absence of skilled cybersecurity workers has a particular impact on the maritime transportation system (MTS) because ""traditional"" cyberdefense skills do not directly translate to the maritime information ecosystem, so we are even further behind. The maritime domain is a highly intertwined system of systems, composed of a complex and interconnected collection of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). Maritime's information ecosystem is a mix of data centers, networks, sensors, communication systems, and end-user devices that are subject to the same cyberdefense requirements as the rest of the information universe. That said, the MTS has unique cybersecurity requirements, including the combination of many moving and stationary parts; smart ships, ports, and cargo; cyber-physical systems and operational technology; maritime-specific navigation and situational awareness systems; and human-machine interfaces. The CyberBoat Challenge started in 2022 and has become an annual educational event, bringing together cybersecurity students learning about maritime systems, industry partners and government. It is a cooperative learning opportunity where students examine the maritime environment and maritime information systems in order to understand the protocols, operations and interfaces - and how they all relate to the real world. Traditional methods of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development benefit from new and innovative ideas in order to teach students about the many niche technical specialties that have emerged in last couple of decades and, in particular, to develop the next generation of cyberdefense professionals in the maritime industry. Maritime product vendors, ports, shipping lines, merchant mariners, and others in the maritime domain need to be creative in where we find people for cyber roles, which might include professionals from the engine room or the bridge. The maritime industry must also engage more fully with academic institutions to channel students in understanding the unique needs within the maritime domain. A handful of colleges and universities in the U.S. and globally are already focusing on maritime in their computer science, computer engineering, cybersecurity, or other related programs. The CyberBoat Challenge provides one way in which faculty and students from these — and other — academic institutions can meet and network. The CyberBoat events specifically seek industry and government involvement to help create a miniature ecosystem which not only helps students understand the context of the material and problems, but also helps them form ties with potential mentors and potential employers regardless if their goals are industry, government, academia, or the security community. There is an adage that engineers don't understand security. This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the most common software flaws reported today are the same as the most common software flaws reported 25 years ago. All too often, engineers work in solution space and not problem space; i.e., they work on solving known problems but they're not necessarily trained to go out and seek new problems hidden in our increasingly complex technology systems. Indeed, most undergraduate courses teach technical topics by assigning problem sets rather than assigning students to find problems. By bringing together people with diverse academic and experiential backgrounds, students new to this information environment can exercise the critical thinking necessary to identify problems that we may not yet have recognized before they appeared in tragic ways. Every time an accidental event occurs in an IT or OT system on a ship or at a port, cyber processionals — and adversaries — look to see if there's a cyberattack vector that might deliberately cause the same outcome. Consider the failure of a microswitch in the steering control system on BBC Africa, causing her to collide with Common Faith in Houston in August 2023, or the tripped breaker resulting in a power failure on Dali, causing an allision with — and catastrophic failure of — the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March 2024. CyberBoat is not a cyber competition. The event is pro-industry, and its raison d'être is to help industry understand and address cybersecurity challenges. It is a resource for participants to draw on in terms of augmenting education; making industry connections; understanding the needs, priorities, and remedies of sister organizations; understanding the perspective and role of governmental agencies; and as a recruitment resource for companies looking for interns and employees. It also helps to build a cohort of students learning a new way to think critically about problem identification and solution. While this is a new approach within the maritime domain to address a long-existent problem, the CyberBoat Challenge is using a well-known engagement and education model which was pioneered by its ""elder siblings"" — CyberAuto Challenge since 2012 and CyberTruck Challenge since 2017 — which have served as a training and mentoring asset for industry, academia, government, and students, and has seen many hundreds of past participants enter the transportation cybersecurity field. This training system works and has had positive effects in the community of interest. The next CyberBoat Challenge is in December and will be held at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.

Everllence Breaks Ground on New Danish HQ,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/everllence-breaks-ground-on-new-danish-hq,,02/09/2025 23:38:13,,"[By: Everllence] Everllence has held a groundbreaking ceremony in Roskilde, Denmark to mark the commencement of the building phase of its new Danish headquarters. Called ‘The Valley’, the development is a joint venture between Everllence and Volkswagen Immobilien, the Volkswagen Group’s real-estate division. The company states that its current base in Greater Copenhagen – and its Holeby, southern Denmark site – have given rise to many innovations that drive climate-neutral shipping, including such world-firsts as the high-pressure dual-fuel two-stroke engine, methanol-powered engines, as well as the first firing of a two-stroke engine fuelled by ammonia. However, the sites’ current facilities – particularly at its Copenhagen location – are outdated with major renovations otherwise looming. The decision to relocate is driven then by strategic necessity with The Valley offering space for growth, both in terms of workforce and production capacity, and in an industrial setting that facilitates the testing of new fuel-technologies while ensuring safer logistics. The ceremony was attended by members of the Everllence Executive Board and a number of prominent guests, including: Everllence CEO, Dr Uwe Lauber; Managing Director Volkswagen Immobilien, Hardy Brennecke; Everllence Head of Two-Stroke Business and Country Manager Denmark, Bjarne Foldager; and Mayor of Roskilde, Tomas Breddam. Lauber said: “Today’s event marks a historic milestone in Everllence’s journey. As we turn the first sod in this exciting venture, we are laying the foundation – not just for a new campus, but for a new chapter in our company’s history. Our current facilities in Denmark have served us well but were not built for the future we are envisaging. This location is purposely designed for excellence, tailored to the unique needs of our people, our technologies, and our decarbonisation aspirations. The future starts here – and it starts now.” Located on the site of a former gravel pit, The Valley campus lies 40 km west of Copenhagen and will comprise a 70,000 m2 complex of buildings including office space for at least 1,500 workstations, a teaching academy, meeting centre and an employee club. Construction by general contractor, DS Flexhal, will also see the building of a production unit and warehouse, as well as a research centre with testing facilities. Speaking on behalf of VW Immobilien, Brennecke said: “The traditional groundbreaking ceremony for ‘The Valley Campus’ marks the start of construction for a special real-estate project. Over the next few years, modern, sustainable office and production facilities, an academy, and meeting areas will be built on the approximately 175,000 m2 site. With this sustainable construction project, Everllence is underscoring its successful business development. We wish everyone involved in the project a thriving and accident-free construction period.” Foldager said: ”This project is also a strategic consolidation that brings together our teams from Copenhagen and Holeby, creating an environment where expertise meets collaboration, where two-stroke meets four-stroke – and with room to grow, free from the constraints of residential surroundings. Here, we can innovate safely, efficiently, and responsibly – especially as we work with new fuels like ammonia. Together, we are building more than a main location for Everllence in Denmark; we are building a legacy.”",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03

Damen Launches latest Island Class for BC Ferries,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/damen-launches-latest-island-class-for-bc-ferries,,02/09/2025 01:33:00,,"[By: Damen Shipyards] On 27 August, Damen Shipyards Group launched the latest Island Class ferry for Canada’s BC Ferries. The vessel is the second of four Island Class vessels currently under construction at Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania. Once operational, the ferries will provide low emission services connecting coastal communities along the coast of British Columbia. Forward steps When delivered, the ferry will be the eighth Island Class vessel that Damen has built for BC Ferries. The Island Class is based on the design of the Damen 8117 Electric Ferry (E3). The Galati shipyard has seen a lot of activity on all four Island Class vessels under construction over the past few weeks. In early July, the yard also marked the grand block assembly of the ninth vessel, and the keel laying of the tenth, on the same day. These ferries will transport passengers between Nanaimo and Gabriola Island, and Campbell River and Quadra Island. Damen is outfitting the vessels with diesel-electric hybrid propulsion. In the future, once the relevant electrical infrastructure is in place, BC Ferries intends to operate the ferries on 100% electric power. Long-term collaboration Damen Executive Director Global Sales Leo Postma said, “There’s been a lot of movement on the various Island Class vessels over the past few months and it’s very exciting for our team to see progress unfolding at such a rate. We continue to enjoy an excellent cooperation with BC Ferries. We are very grateful for the quality of this relationship, which is undoubtedly a significant factor in the ongoing success of the project.” Damen is also supplying BC Ferries with onshore charging equipment and will, via its BC-based Service Hub, continue to provide its client with support during the vessels’ operational phase. A new generation In a further step forward for sustainable public transport operations, the four Island Class vessels currently undergoing construction are being modified to reduce underwater radiated noise. Together, Damen and BC Ferries undertook a series of underwater noise measurements on the Island Class vessels already in operation. Damen, working with its suppliers, has put the findings from these measurements into reducing underwater radiated noise in this next generation of Island Class vessels. This is in line with BC Ferries’ Long Term Underwater Management Plan. The company has developed this Management Plan minimise impacts on marine life in the areas in which it operates, most notably the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale. Measures taken include hull drag reduction via towing tank testing after a number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Additionally, the adaptations were made to the vessels’ propulsion system including a new quieter and more efficient propeller blade design.

Bringing Command and Accountability Back to Surface Fleet Maintenance,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/bringing-command-and-accountability-back-to-surface-fleet-maintenance,,31/08/2025 23:40:34,,"There are times when “the way things are” are no longer acceptable. Radical change, with incremental and careful execution, is urgently needed within the US Navy’s Surface Ship Repair Maintenance enterprise to rectify the shortcomings of two decades of well-intentioned initiatives that rendered a majority of Surface ships neglected and ill-equipped for combat. The problem is not wholly maintenance related – the contributing issues came about as an aggregate result of the Navy’s increased operational tempo since the start of the Global War on Terror, changes in Surface Force manning models, and disputes with Congress over the decommissioning of certain classes of ships, among other things. Recent operations in the Red Sea today are eerily reminiscent of the world in 2002 when we stretched the Navy thin to answer the nation’s call – and paid a price for decades. A recent GAO report highlighted the impact of manning shortages to ship crew’s ability to perform corrective maintenance; over 75 percent of Executive Officers stated that it was “difficult or very difficult” to complete required corrective maintenance. To address the lack of sustained success, and avoid the missteps of the past, the Surface Force and NAVSEA should employ a multi-tiered approach primarily centered on retaking control of shipboard maintenance to get us fair in the channel again. 2002-2010: MSMO and Management Failure The story begins with the war in the Middle East in 2003. For the first time in decades, the Navy’s answer to the nation’s call to action, pushed the fleet forward, and kept it there, using its Tomahawks and Marines to enable an immensely successful land campaign. It was not by coincidence that the president chose an aircraft carrier as a platform to announce “Mission Accomplished.” The cost of that prolonged surge, however, was the deferral of a mountain of maintenance that had been scheduled for the ships and then canceled. The Navy needed to invent a way to get those ships back in service quickly and efficiently. Working with industry, the Navy developed a plan that would leverage the strengths of certain shipyards for certain types of maintenance and provide stability for the workforce by bundling multiple ships of the same class together with the idea that this would result in money savings and efficiencies in the process. This plan, called MSMO (Multi-Ship-Multi-Option) plan was implemented in the early 2000’s. As envisioned, this plan was a good idea, however naval officers know very little about the business world. There was an implicit assumption in the execution of the MSMO plan that the Navy would save money by encouraging the industry to voluntarily decrease their bottom line. Read that again. It was never going to happen, and it didn’t happen. As a contractor following my retirement, I learned that ship repair business is just that – a business. Right or wrong, income is predicated on the Navy spending money to fix ships – any significant efficiencies in that process result in less money spent, and thus less profit. Less profit makes stockholders unhappy and drives businesses out of business. At the same time, the Navy decided to save manpower dollars for other programs such as the Optimal Manning and Top Six Rolldown initiatives, which reduced shipboard manning and mandated the dissolution of the Ships Intermediate Maintenance Activities (SIMAs), which had been around since the early 1980s. In fact, the GAO reports that the backlog of incomplete maintenance exceeded any savings from manpower cuts that were instituted as part of Optimal Manning and other reductions in shipboard manning. The SIMA dissolution was especially problematic since SIMAs were primarily designed to be focused on two things: leveraging Sailors on shore duty to conduct relatively minor and mid-level repairs using the expertise gained at sea and training shipboard Sailors in their technical rating. The elimination of SIMAs had a second impact: it meant all work had to go to contractors at a much higher price. While it may be true that the cost of SIMA was higher than the projected cost of giving the work to private industry – SIMA was cheaper only if you did not consider the actual cost of SIMA, e.g. salaries, facilities, etc., the Sailor cost was already spent, and the training and experience of working on equipment in-rate on shore duty is difficult to put a price tag on. An additional phenomenon I observed was that the cadre of government planners who performed availability and maintenance planning and preparations were released and hired by contractors as this process moved to industry under the Multi Ship Multi Option (MSMO) strategy. This did not change the net number of personnel in this area, but it made the cost and scope of those with this skill set a bit more difficult to track and quantify, and may have added a cost to the process as well. In parallel, the Navy drastically reduced the footprint of an organization called Supervisor of Shipbuilding, who was basically the “overseer” designed to hold the ship builders and ship maintainers honest and uphold standards. Around this timeframe (roughly 2007-2010), another dynamic came and went: Ship Class Squadrons, or CLASSRONs. Modeled after the Naval Aviation Enterprise, these groups were formed around each ship class and were given control of maintenance funding, acquisition processes, and current readiness. Led by sequential major commanders with experience in a specific ship class, they consolidated processes, lessons learned, assessments, and maintenance under one individual – wearing a command pin. They also tracked Class Advisories and major modifications across a focused subset of ships. As a cruiser commanding officer, I (Cordle) was overwhelmingly satisfied with the support received by the class advocate. In my specific case, the Cruiser CLASSRON Commander had held my job before, and therefore understood it. The CLASSRON Commander had the time and bandwidth to deal with roughly 20 ships compared with the current model where one Engineering Duty Officer Captain has to process all of the maintenance information associated with over 100 ships on each coast. The CLASSRON initiative was not given enough “bake time” and would have likely produced significant dividends if left in place. This occurred in 2012 with the justification that it created a parallel C2 process and muddied the waters with respect to funding. In an effort to improve oversight, Commander Navy Regional Maintenance Center, (CNRMC), was established in 2010 to standardize and oversee the Regional Maintenance Centers, whose processes were perceived to have drifted over the years. The goal was to place a flag officer on the waterfront with the supporting staff to police the maintenance process. While initially successful, the center of gravity of that organization has shifted to Washington and away from the waterfront. And in another manning decision, the Navy combined two flag positions, one for ship maintenance and one for modernization, placing arguably the two most complex functions in the Navy enterprise on the shoulders of one junior Flag officer. From this author’s experience, this task is too great for one individual, no matter how Herculean his or her efforts could be – they will always be pulled in two directions – one toward, and one away from the waterfront. 2011-2014: The Trends Worsen In the early 2010s, the VADM Balisle report and subsequent GAO findings were released, indicating a dangerous trend of neglect within the Surface Force. As a result, the Navy looked to reverse course in Sailor maintenance, manpower/manning models, and Officer training – albeit this was a slow change. As an outcrop of these reports and the associated action items, the Navy implemented the Surface Engineering Maintenance Planning Project, SURFMEPP, designed to focus on life cycle maintenance, act as the “conscience of the Navy” to get ships to expected service life, which has been extended several times from 35 to 45 years over the same period. With 2013 entered sequestration, government shutdowns, and funding shortfalls across the enterprise. During my time (Cordle) on active duty, I sat at the front table of Naval Surface Forces Atlantic time and again and signed documents that cut significant lifecycle maintenance from Surface ship availabilities because the money was not available. To be sure, the confluence of these factors did make the MSMO more efficient, more flexible, and able to maximize the work completed, but it did not save money. The other unfortunate side effect was that a lack of rigor and uniformed oversight on the Navy side allowed companies to take advantage of the situation thereby increasing profits, although they arguably used much of the extra income to reinvest and try to grow, train, and pay their workforce in a standard capitalist model (that we laud in most other applications) – but with the Navy as their only paying customer. In the end, industry conducted themselves like any capitalist business that has to make money to stay viable. It is worth noting as background perhaps, but even before sequestration the lack of stability in the funding lines created considerable volatility in the repair community even under MSMO – the long-standing practice of underfunding surface ship maintenance and then using mid-year plus ups to close the gap to meet requirements generates its own uncertainty every fiscal year, as I experienced in my short tenure as a Type Commander Maintenance Officer in 2011 (Cordle). Thus, the MSMO financing vehicle coupled with the elimination of SIMAs, which was initially hailed as a process designed to get the most work done (albeit at a premium price), fell victim to economics, in that the expected savings never materialized. As a result, in the decade that was the 2005 to 2015, the Surface Navy gave away its ability to fix itself and took out title loans on its ships in the form of a maintenance backlog to the tune of billions of dollars. Add to this the compounding “interest” of fewer Sailors with less training conducting shipboard self-evaluation, and you get the expected result: a rather large volume of unaddressed maintenance discrepancies aboard ships. 2015-2020:Replacing MSMO with MACMO About halfway through this journey, in the 2010s after one or two complete change outs of the key leaders who brought MSMO to the table, a new narrative developed: civilian contractors are making too much money and keeping the ships longer to increase their bottom line. Unfortunately, rather than conduct a holistic self-analysis of the system, the Navy abruptly scrapped the MSMO concept in favor of a firm-fixed price, restrictive process that allowed a relatively small set of contractors to bid on large availabilities individually and called it another name bathed in obfuscation: the Multi Award Contract Multi Option, or MACMO, process. Designed to cure the ills of the MSMO process by driving competition and accountability into the system, this was another good idea, but as Admiral (ret) Jesse Wilson once said, “whenever you create a new process you create new problems”. Since this was a fairly classic “top down” initiative, there was not much of an appetite for pushback or critique and not much time to shift the processes to support it. Several established and complex processes were taken on by the government, including the purchasing of long lead time materials and the complex and detailed planning process, without a robust experience base or training program in place to support it. The learning curve for this change was a steep one, and the Navy paid a price in planning and material delays during the transition to this new process. A 2017 GAO report captured the precise cost of these manning decisions, in terms of unexecuted maintenance, in billions of dollars and millions of man-days. The graphs are eye-popping and relevant even today. Manpower Savings were more than offset by increased maintenance costs (Source: GAO) Now came some interesting system dynamics that while predicted, created a new set of issues when juxtaposed against the changes previously mentioned. First, the Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers (DDGs) and the Harpers Ferry-class Landing Ship, Dock ships (LSDs) entered their midlife periods, forcing maintenance availabilities to extend beyond the previous 3 to 5-month durations into durations of 12-18 months. This length change required more planning, more parts, and a larger, better trained workforce in industry, all of which were sub-optimized by the transition to MACMO. Secondly, the Navy also revived the Coast Wide Bid process that surprised many when it actually happened to USS RAMAGE and again to USS SHOUP a few years later. Navy Manpower and manning management processes in both the active duty and civilian side are not aligned to support such endeavors. Thirdly, Congress and the Navy treated the Cruisers and LSDs as chips in a game of poker, alternately placing them on decommissioning lists, cutting their funding to near zero, laying them up, and then trying to bring them back after a bluff has been called. This resulted in huge sunk costs, delays in critical repairs, not to mention the impact on manning and morale of crews that were “strung along” for years in a decommissioning mindset. Like trying to restore the old Ford truck that one would find in their grandfather’s pasture, this effort has grown in cost and magnitude far beyond original estimates, sucking money away from other endeavors. Delays in designing a replacement for these capital ships, which are pretty awesome warfighters, have resulted in their being kept around, with the quandary that no capital ship is as capable, nor as expensive to maintain, as our aged cruisers. 2020-Present: The Consequences A 2020 GAO report found that “since shifting to the Multiple Award Contract-Multi Order (MACMO) contracting approach for ship maintenance work in 2015, the Navy has increased competition opportunities, gained flexibility to ensure quality of work, and limited cost growth, but schedule delays persist. During this period, 21 of 41 ship maintenance periods, called availabilities, for major repair work cost less than initially estimated, and average cost growth across the 41 availabilities was 5 percent. Schedule outcomes were less positive, and Navy regional maintenance centers varied in their performance.2 This is shown in the graph below: Schedule delays under MAC-MO Contracting (Source: GAO) Admiral Galinis, who later commanded NAVSEA as a 3-star, when asked at a 2015 Fleet Maintenance Seminar what changes the MACMO would bring around, he said “two things we will lose are flexibility and teamwork.” In retrospect, he was correct. Unfortunately, they were lost at a time when they were much needed. Another ingredient added to this complex system of setbacks was the ramp up of operational employment based on growing threats in the Pacific and in the Arabian Gulf. This resulted in policies of maintenance deferral and reduced certification requirements, all well documented in the Comprehensive Review of 2017. Righting the Ship In a 2019 article, David Larter described Navy Maintenance as a “dumpster fire.” While we do not fully agree with this dark assessment, it is definitely in need of a good overhaul. Surface Navy leaders have taken some action to help put us in a good place, including: 1. Surface Type Commanders have established a Post-Major Command Surface Warfare O-6 billet to oversee all aspects of the maintenance domain. This brings experience, oversight, and seniority to the process and is starting to pay dividends. 2. Establishment of Surface Readiness Groups – this initiative (which is not new) theoretically restores the positive attributes found in CLASSRONs. Under the Surface Readiness Group model, all ships in the Maintenance Phase are aligned under one Commodore per homeport, allowing a singular focus on maintenance and freeing up the deployed Commodores to focus on warfighting. These are great steps to remedy the problems. Imagine if a Ford F-150 production line had to deal with a change to baseline of about 30 percent – this would be a flawed business model. Yet, this is what we ask the maintenance community to deal with every time a ship enters a yard period. To address this dilemma, the Surface Force needs to improve its scope of work planning for upcoming surface availabilities. Additionally, there should be more margin built into the schedule and price of each availability. Availabilities should start with a measure of float built in, and the Surface Force should resist the urge to plan against this float. Further, the Surface Force should acknowledge that there will be increases to scope and new work, instead of ignoring it or pretending it will not manifest. By leveraging options, frontloads, class maintenance plans, and flexible contracting, it must be possible to fund and plan for both long-term maintenance and current repairs. Things on a ship break all the time, and the process needs to be proactive vice reactive. Additionally, the Navy should consider the following measures: 1. Treat this like the crisis that it is. Assemble a team of the most experienced people and challenge them to come up with a plan but force them to take off their functional “armor” (acquisition, modernization, maintenance, contracting, etc.) to collaborate on a new plan that is innovative, integrated, and responsible. This team should be challenged to openly discuss the best and worst parts of each model from MSMO to MACMO, Firm Fixed Price and Cost-Plus contracts. The narrative that “the utterance of the word MSMO will result in career suicide” is not helpful here. 2. Restore SIMA as a separate command. SIMAs are currently resident within Code 900 at the Regional Maintenance Centers. This construct sub optimizes SIMA’s visibility, employment, and effectiveness. Command is command; and putting a Shore Command Pin on the Commander of Ship Intermediate Maintenance would open additional command opportunities to the Engineering Duty Officer community – and consequently be good for the ships and Sailors. 3. Empower the local shipyard. Currently a Shipyard Commander has relatively no tools or levers to punish or incentivize a lead maintenance activity during a Shipyard availability. For instance, if an LMA neglects to conduct a repair within a prescribed timeline, or the work is not completed to the level of quality that it should, the shipyard has to spend exorbitant amounts of time, resources, and money to present an iron-clad case to fiscally punish the LMA. In many cases, it is more cost effective to not pursue punishment. Conversely, the Shipyard Commander has little to no way of rewarding a LMA who does a job well (on time and/or under budget). Consideration should be given to allowing the Shipyard Commander, with delegation to pertinent Project Managers, to fiscally reward or withhold a relatively small percentage of money at their level. The shipyard represents the “tactical ground commander” and observes many violations in Shipboard maintenance, and has very little ability to affect immediate change. 4. Fix the planning phase of major availabilities. On average, the amount of work during a major availability changes by roughly 30 percent after it begins. This corresponds to a range of 2,000 and 20,000 Requests for Contract Changes (RCCs) depending on the length of the maintenance period. One solution is a “Business Model Cost and Schedule” approach that was published in the Naval Engineer’s Journal in 2021. 5. Revive the good parts of the MSMO strategy to include focusing certain repair yards on certain classes of ships and providing bundled ship contracts over a period of years to allow consistency, gain some efficiencies, and train a workforce for the nation’s future. This approach does not have to be unitary in its contracting strategy but could include a more flexible pricing process described in #1 above. The contracting officers will have issues with this, but we cannot continue to build the maintenance process around the contracting process instead of around the Fleet. Many in the commercial industry have shared that a predictable and dependable income stream are critical to allowing industry to train the workforce and invest in infrastructure. 6. Leverage the goodness of processes like the Continuous Intermediate Availability (CIA) model conducted in Rota, Spain, which is similar to the old 13-week availabilities, where TYCOM-level maintenance is accomplished in short, focused maintenance periods. This could be folded into the OFRP, perhaps at the beginning of the Sustainment Phase right after deployment, and the ship return to service for a while before starting maintenance. To be sure, this initiative will have to be balanced against the need of the Operational Commander. 7. Split the Flag Officer billets for maintenance and modernization. There isn’t a single root cause for many of the current issues, nor is the problem with any particular individual. However, the move to put too many decisions on a single individual’s plate was a singularly bad move and needs to be fixed quickly. 8. Move the commander of CNRMC to Norfolk, and place a deputy in San Diego. The vision of CNRMC that was put in place by USFF in 2010 was to place a Flag Officer on the waterfront overseeing ship’s maintenance. That fundamental tenet has been lost but could be regained relatively simply. The new modernization Flag Officer can satiate the appetite in Washington for information, while their maintenance counterpart can get “boots on the ground” and start extracting ships from the yards with a crowbar instead of a 300-mile towing hawser. Of note, a similar move was just implemented with the creation of a Flag Officer billet to supervise the nuclear shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia. 9. Replicate the Supervisor of Shipbuilding model from the nuclear side at the regional maintenance centers. Empower them to provide oversight, accountability, and rigor to the ship repair process. Put teeth back into the process. Rewrite the NAVSEA Standard Item 009-060 to require contractors to provide a detailed, integrated plan that can be graphed, tracked and used to hold them to account. If there is one thing I hear over and over from Commanding Officers in the yards, it is “who is holding anyone accountable?” You can figure out the answer. No one. 10. Bring back a deployable ship repair capability to replace the Yellowstone Class Destroyer Tenders by installing a full machine repair capability (including Additive Manufacturing) into one Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) class ship in each theater. These multi-purpose platforms have lots of space and could probably support a modular solution as well. Manning could be surged from the Regional Maintenance Centers in time of need. This is not an argument to completely revert to the old way of doing things. This article is formulated from not just our own experiences, but multiple peers who (at least to some extent) feel the same way. One shared, “Firm Fixed Price is a great model for the commercial industry or Maritime Sealift Command, for basic maintenance on ships that are not all that complex; it is exactly the wrong model for complex warships that require expertise, flexibility, and integration – like Navy ships.” There were many sins (including some in which at least one of us was complicit), all well intentioned, and many unavoidable over the years. But by scrapping programs that used to work, and failing to look for another solution, we will all simply admire the problem as more and more of the Fleet is tied to the pier when it is needed most. Instead, the Surface Warfare Community needs to take control of its own destiny, help the Engineering Duty Officer community do its core job, assume responsibility for the maintenance of its ships, increase command opportunity, and inject rigor, decisiveness, and accountability into a system where these words have gone out of style. One key component of any strategy is to “take a fix.” The 2022 GAO report on maintenance backlog provides a stunning insight into the lack of accuracy and estimating the value of deferred maintenance. The amount provided to the GAO was literally off by a factor of 10 ($1.8 billion vs $180 million). This gap was then addressed by accelerating decommissioning of multiple ships which collectively represented about 80% of the gap. Unfortunately this approach addresses the immediate problem without addressing the root cause; its effect will be temporary and cannot be repeated. As today’s Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Readiness Groups engage in global combat operations unparalleled in modern history, with even less ships than we had during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the same forces at work in 2002 are starting to become evident, with deployments stretching to an average of over 220 days and no end in sight. Unless something changes, we are likely to find ourselves in the same position 10 years from now. Captain John Cordle, USN, retired from the Navy in 2013 after 30 years of service. He commanded the USS Oscar Austin (DDG-79) and USS San Jacinto (CG-56), earning a Bronze Star in 2003 and the U.S. Navy League’s Captain John Paul Jones Award for Inspirational Leadership in 2010. He is a Plankowner on CVN 75 and CVN 77, where he served as Reactor Officer. He received the SNA Literary Award in 2014 and 2019, as well as the 2019 ASNE Solberg Award and U. S. Naval Institute Author of the Year Award for his contributions to fatigue management in the United States Navy. In addition to serving as Chief of Staff for Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (SURFLANT), he also served as a Program Manager for Maintenance University at Hunnington Ingalls Industries and as a GS 14 Human Factors Engineer at SURFLANT, where he was recognized with the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Now retired, he is focused on leveraging his life experience to help develop future leaders. Captain Holman Agard, USN, has a combined 27 years of service between the Enlisted and Officer ranks. He currently is serving as the Commanding Officer of USS SHOUP (DDG 86) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Commander for the GEORGE WASHINGTON Carrier Strike Group (CSG-5) based in Yokosuka, Japan. Previously, he served in OPNAV N96 as the Destroyers Branch Head and Ships Deputy. He also was the Executive Officer and Commanding Officer in USS HOPPER (DDG 70). He has experienced extensive maintenance availabilities in all six ships he has been stationed on.

Wallem Launches Vessel IT Security and Management Services,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/wallem-launches-vessel-it-security-and-management-services,,31/08/2025 23:10:58,,"[By: Wallem Group] Wallem Group, a leading global maritime partner, has launched a suite of support and consultancy services to protect IT systems onboard its clients’ vessels from disruption. Its new Vessel IT Security and Management Services (VITS) offer comprehensive support to enable smooth, secure and efficient IT at sea in an increasingly digitalised and regulated maritime world. VITS have been developed with a ship's entire digital ecosystem in mind – from its business networks to the Internet of Things (IoT) systems on which operations and humans rely. It includes six management and security services to help keep vessel IT systems up and running, and minimise cyber threats. Wallem VITS offer continuous Servicedesk Support to customers from experts in vessel IT. When necessary, enquiries are escalated to specialist in-depth service teams. A Remote Vessel Infra Support service swiftly resolves IT issues from shore. In more complex cases, Wallem offers Onboard Vessel IT Support, deploying engineers to the ship to offer hands-on assistance with IT infrastructure, system upgrades, health checks and troubleshooting. “The VITS suite is Wallem’s comprehensive response to shipping’s advancing digitalisation, and the critical role IT reliability plays in maritime operations,” said Steve Whitby, Group IT & Technology Director, Wallem Group. “Ship owners increasingly seek efficiencies from remote IT support, remote management, and remote monitoring of vessel operations. Securing these benefits requires deep IT knowledge and long-standing maritime experience. VITS delivers these core specialised services.” Shipping’s growing reliance on IT explained why the other three service modules in VITS focus on cyber security, added Whitby. “Modern vessel operations demand connected IT infrastructure, but this can expose outdated onboard systems and virus signatures, hardware performance issues, and deficiencies in data back-up and IT support. Owners must secure networks, onboard systems, and data against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorised access. VITS offers tailored services to safeguard vessel IT.” VITS includes a Vulnerability Management service, through which the Wallem team scans shipboard computers annually to identify vulnerabilities, then applies patches and security-hardening measures remotely to ensure the vessel's IT remains secure and compliant. Its Advanced Endpoint Protection, meanwhile, is a signatureless security service that uses machine learning and behavioural analysis to defend systems against zero-day attacks and evolving threats. Critical systems are safeguarded by an Enhanced Backup Service, which is activated in the event of a cyber-attack or hardware failure. It features a network-based back-up vault with integrated virus protection, remote monitoring and restoration support. VITS also offers a Security Benchmark Service, reporting on security gaps, compliance shortfalls and best practice.

Pacific Island Nations are Divided Over Deep Sea Mining,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/pacific-island-nations-are-divided-over-deep-sea-mining,,31/08/2025 20:34:59,,"[By Kolaia Raisele and Aidan Craney] In recent years, Pacific island nations have earned global credibility as champions of climate action. Pacific leaders view sea level rise as an existential threat. But this united front is now under strain as some Pacific nations pursue a controversial new industry – deep-sea mining. Nauru, the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Tonga have gone the furthest to make it a reality, attracted by new income streams. But nations such as Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining in international waters. Public opinion across the Pacific is often divided, pitting possible economic gains against the potential risks of an industry whose environmental impact remain uncertain but potentially significant. As this tension intensifies, it may split the Pacific and risk the region’s moral authority on climate. What are the concerns over deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining targets three types of mineral deposits – polymetallic nodules strewn across deep underwater plains, cobalt-rich crusts on seamounts, and the ore deposits around hydrothermal vents. To extract them, mining companies can use unmanned collectors to pump ore to the surface and return the wastewater. This creates plumes of sediment which can smother marine life. Methods of minimizing damage to species from mining on land are largely unworkable at depth. Deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood, but we know they are slow to recover. Researchers have found areas mined as a test more than 40 years ago still show physical damage and immobile corals and sponges remain scarce. Many species live on the seabeds, seamounts and hydrothermal vents which would be targeted for mining. Pictured: a crab crawling across a field of polymetallic nodules near Gosnold Seamount. NOAA, CC BY-NC-ND Why is there so much interest in deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining hasn’t begun anywhere in earnest, because the International Seabed Authority has yet to finalize rules governing extraction. This authority oversees the 54% of the world’s oceans beyond territorial waters. But plans for deep-sea mining operations can still be submitted and considered without these rules in place. Analysts have estimated seabed minerals could be worth a staggering A$30 trillion. Some of the richest deposits lie in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters between Hawaii and Mexico, thousands of kilometers away from Pacific nations. Under international law, companies cannot mine in international waters on their own. They need to be officially sponsored by a national government, which has to keep effective control over its operations. One reason deep-sea mining companies see Pacific states as such useful partners is that these countries can access reserved areas of international seabed set aside for developing countries, as well as potential resources in the very large territorial waters around many island states. Backers in Nauru, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Kiribati argue rising demand for manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel could deliver significant economic returns and diversify economies. Nauru’s enormous deposits of guano – compressed seabird excrement long sought as fertilizer – once made the country wealthy. But the guano is largely gone and the small nation has limited other resources. Nauru sponsors Nauru Ocean Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of seabed mining company The Metals Company. In 2011, the company received an International Seabed Authority contract permitting exploration of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, more than 8,000km from Nauru. Nauru has since “proudly taken a leading role” in developing international legal frameworks in mining nodules in the international seabed. In June, Nauru signalled Nauru Ocean Resources would apply for an exploitation license. Tonga’s government is similarly backing deep-sea mining by partnering with The Metals Company to explore mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. In August 2025, Tonga signed an updated agreement with Tonga Offshore Mining, a subsidiary of The Metals Company. The agreement was originally signed in 2021 amid large-scale criticism over the lack of public consultation. The mining company has promised new benefits, ranging from financial benefits, scholarships and community programs. Even so, the revised deal has encountered opposition from civil society, young people and legal experts. Prominent Tongans remain unconvinced, citing environmental, legal and transparency risks. Economic pressure is part of the picture. Tonga owes an estimated $120 million to China’s Exim Bank – roughly a quarter of its annual GDP. Cook Islands The 15 Cook Islands are widely scattered, giving the government exclusive rights to almost two million square kilometers of ocean. The government has issued exploration licenses inside its Exclusive Economic Zone to three companies – Cook Islands Consortium, CIIC Seabed Resources Limited, and Moana Minerals. The Cook Islands government has established a domestic regulatory framework and is building research capacity. Kiribati’s atolls and island are even more dispersed. The nation’s exclusive economic zone covers about 3.4 million km2. The state-owned Marawa Research and Exploration company holds a 15-year exploration contract with the seabed authority. Kiribati has opened talks with China to explore potential collaboration. The Pacific split While revenues could potentially be sizeable for the Pacific, costs, technologies and environmental liabilities are highly uncertain. The experience of Papua New Guinea is a cautionary tale. In 2019, the PNG deep-sea mining venture Solwara-1 went into administration following intense community pushback. The fallout cost the government an estimated $184 million. The PNG government now opposes deep-sea mining in its territorial waters. Nautilus Mineral’s Solwara-1 deep-sea mining project in Papua New Guinea wound up in 2019. Pictured: the company’s three seabed mining vehicles. Credit Nautilus Minerals / handout image While deep-sea mining now has clear backers, other nations are far more wary. In 2022, Palau launched an alliance calling for a moratorium on mining in international waters. Early signatories included Fiji, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands have joined, as well as dozens of other countries. PNG has not yet joined. Opposition from these Pacific states is based on the precautionary principle, which favors caution when knowledge is limited and damage is possible. Pacific youth are among the most prominent opponents of deep-sea mining. The regional Pacific Blue Line coalition uniting civil society, faith groups, women’s organizations and youth networks has consistently called for a complete ban in the region. Young people have spoke out publicly in nations such as Tonga, where youth advocates criticized limited consultation and rallied against the plans, as well as the Cook Islands, where young people have demanded transparency. Reputation under a cloud? Pacific leaders have built a worldwide reputation for their principled climate diplomacy, from championing the 1.5°C goal to the major new advisory opinion on climate change issued by the world’s top court in response to a case instigated by students from the University of the South Pacific. If some Pacific leaders open the door fully to deep-sea mining, it risks undermining the region’s united front on environmental issues and threatens its credibility. The way this plays out will shape how the world hears the Pacific on climate and the oceans in the years ahead. Kolaia Raisele is a PhD Candidate in Anthropology, La Trobe University.

UK Denies the Royal Navy Cannot Meet Operational Tasking,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/uk-denies-the-royal-navy-cannot-meet-operational-tasking,,31/08/2025 17:10:00,,"Information from multiple sources suggests that the Royal Navy is now unable to meet commitments in several important areas, contrary to UK Ministry of Defence insistence that it is continuing to meet its operational tasking. A pattern of over-reliance on allies for support in order to maintain basic operational capabilities is apparent in a number of areas. For political reasons the Ministry appears unwilling to acknowledge the difficulties. But the problems are now so widespread that the collapse in capability has become glaringly obvious, and all too embarrassing for friends and allies to mention. The state of affairs is primarily a responsibility of British governments over many years who have shrunk the defense budget and delayed shipbuilding decisions, such that vessels are going out of service before new ships are delivered. At the same time, insufficient numbers of ships are being built to meet operational tasking, and the situation is compounded by a crisis in recruitment and retention. The issues are affecting operational capability across the whole fleet, and are not restricted to discreet capability areas. In the Indo-Pacific, HMS Prince of Wales (R09) continues its long-range deployment. But the Royal Navy is only fielding two of its protective escorts, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless (D33) and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond (F239), the others being provided by a changing cast of ships from Norway, Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. For half of its deployment, the Carrier Strike Group has relied on a Norwegian replenishment ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary being unable to field RFA Tidespring (A136) for the entire cruise. Meanwhile on deck, the carrier is only supporting two squadrons of F-35s, half the number it was designed to carry. Much smaller flattops, for example in the Italian Navy, carry similar numbers of aircraft. Of six Type 45 destroyers, only two are operational, with HMS Daring (D32) about to return to service after a refit lasting over 3,000 days. The eight remaining Type 23 frigates are 30 years old, kept operational only with great difficulty, amongst them HMS Lancaster (F229), rumored likely to be withdrawn from Bahrain this year without replacement. The Type 23s are being replaced by Type 26s, with HMS Glasgow due in service in 2028, and Type 31s, with HMS Venturer due in service by 2027. Even if there are no shipbuilding delays, in 2026 and 2027 the Royal Navy risks being down to less than five frigates, all of dubious serviceability. It is also possible that the Norwegian order for five Type 26 frigates announced on August 31 could delay delivery of some of the eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy through the reallocation of production slots. Underwater, delays in ordering new nuclear ballistic missile submarines mean that the Vanguard Class boats are suffering prolonged unserviceability. The need to always have one ‘bomber’ at sea has meant that three-month deployments are frequently extended, in one case in 2023 to six months. Prolonged deployments generate a whole series of problems, such as crew mental health and retention issues, and inevitably systems on board either fail or scheduled maintenance is missed, risky events in nuclear submarines. The consequences of running the Vanguard boats well beyond their design life will persist until at least the early 2030s, when new Dreadnought Class submarines currently being built start coming into service. The situation with attack submarines is equally dire. The last Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Triumph (S93) was decommissioned in July. Of seven Astute Class submarines to be built, five are commissioned, but only one is believed to be operational, probably committed to protecting the on-station nuclear ballistic submarine at sea. None is available to counter the still-powerful Russian submarine force elsewhere, which probably explains why a recent Russian submarine alarm in the northern Norwegian Sea had to be covered at huge cost by P8 Poseidon aircraft instead. In support of the fleet at sea, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is suffering a manning crisis, and can probably only put four ships to sea. The only healthy component of the fleet appears to be the offshore patrol vessels of the River Class, five of which are deployed to maintain the historic Royal Navy global presence, albeit with their limited firepower. The vessels cover for the shortage of destroyers and frigates - but without any anti-aircraft or anti-submarine capability. Royal Thai Navy versions of the same River Class design have a 76mm gun and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Omani versions have a 76mm gun and Exocet missiles, but the Royal Navy ships for cost reasons only have a 30mm Bushmaster cannon. For the next few years, until ships under construction come into service, Royal Navy planners will be praying that no operational emergencies arise - because so few ships are available to meet contingencies.

Corvus Energy Battery System Powers Latin America’s First Electric Tugboat,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/corvus-energy-battery-system-powers-latin-america-s-first-electric-tugboat,,31/08/2025 15:48:31,,"[By: Corvus Energy] The first electric tugboat in Latin America, the result of a collaboration between the largest towage services operator in the Americas, SAAM, and Chilean national oil company, Enap, is powered by a lithium-ion marine battery system from Corvus Energy. Based on an exclusive design from naval architects Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and built by SANMAR Shipyards for SAAM, the battery-electric tug supports ship berthing and deberthing maneuvers in one of the southernmost terminals in the world—Puerto Chacabuco in the Aysén Region of Chile in South America. About the electric tugboat The battery-powered vessel, named “Trapananda” in honor of the Chilean Patagonia region where the tug operates, measures 25 meters in length, 13 meters in beam and boasts 70 tons of bollard pull capacity, enabling it to assist large vessels under challenging harbor conditions. Third electric tug in the SAAM fleet SAAM, including its division SAAM Towage, operates more than 200 tugboats around the Americas. Notably, the Trapananda is the third battery-electric tug to join the SAAM fleet. In May 2024, SAAM launched two electric tugboats in the Port of Vancouver in Canada, making SAAM among the first zero-emission tug operators in North America. All three tugs are RAL-designed, SANMAR Shipyards-built and equipped with a Corvus Energy battery system. Environmental and operational benefits According to SAAM, battery-powered tugboats are an important part of the Company’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which includes a goal to neutralize 65% of greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of their fleet through reduction and offsetting initiatives. (Source). Fully battery-powered operations produce zero emissions and are almost completely silent. This results in significant environmental benefits, including reduced carbon footprint and less noise pollution, both in port and underwater, protecting coastal communities and marine life alike. Compared to diesel-powered tugs, electric tugboats also offer operational advantages including reduced fuel and maintenance costs. After its first year operating electric tugs in Canada, SAAM reported its “carbon intensity index [had] fallen 72% compared to diesel-powered units with similar features, and a further 90% reduction is projected for the second year of operation. In addition, the electric tugs’ operating costs were reported to be 70% lower than its diesel-powered peers.” (Source). Corvus Energy involvement The Trapananda is equipped with a Corvus Orca ESS, the most installed marine energy storage system, used onboard over 700 maritime vessels worldwide. Like the SAAM electric-powered tugs operating in Vancouver, the Trapananda is outfitted with a 3,616-kWh capacity battery system. “We are proud to support SAAM, RAL and SANMAR by supplying the battery system for the first electric tugboat to operate in Latin America, as well as for the Vancouver-based tugs,” said Tor-Gunnar Hovig, Head of Region Americas at Corvus Energy. He adds, “SAAM is leading the way towards more sustainable port operations in the Americas and beyond with these RAL-designed, SANMAR-built tugs.” ""The arrival of the Trapananda is a turning point for our industry. It signals our decisive move toward cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operations. This project represents our vision for the future: we're developing solutions that not only assist and tow ships but also help mobilize a shift toward a truly sustainable logistics chain. We consider Corvus a strategic partner in this journey,” said Pablo Cáceres, Sustainability and Development Director of SAAM Towage.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 09:30:03

Höegh Autoliners Orders 1st Ammonia Engines for Pure Car & Truck Carriers,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/hoeegh-autoliners-orders-1st-ammonia-engines-for-pure-car-truck-carriers,,30/08/2025 14:55:45,,"[By: Everllence] In a major leap for maritime decarbonisation, Höegh Autoliners has placed a landmark order for ammonia-burning Everllence B&W ME-LGIA engines. Accordingly, 4 × 7S60ME-LGIA (Liquid Gas Injection Ammonia) dual-fuel engines will be delivered to an undisclosed Asian shipyard in connection with the construction of 4 × 9,100 CEU (Car Equivalent Unit) ‘Aurora’-class Pure Car/Truck Carriers (PCTCs). Everllence views the order as signalling a new era for clean propulsion within global shipping. The newbuildings are bound for Höegh Autoliners, the major PCTC operator and part of the Leif Höegh & Co. shipping company. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. will build the engines in South Korea. Sebjørn Dahl, Chief Operations Officer, Höegh Autoliners, said: ""The engines are the beating heart of our vessels, and we take it as a clear mark of confidence that Everllence has chosen us to install some of the world’s first two-stroke ammonia engines on our final four Aurora Class vessels. With nearly 100 years of industry experience, Höegh Autoliners is proud to be among the first companies selected to pioneer this important transition together with Everllence. This collaboration underscores their trust in us as a reliable frontrunner in the shift to zero-emission shipping. Reaching zero is a shared ambition, and Everllence plays a vital role in helping us realize our goal of operating our large PCTC vessels on zero-carbon fuels from 2027."" Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business – Everllence, said: “This order – one of several ammonia pilot-projects we have in China, Japan and South Korea – gives us encouragement that we are on the right path, as does the widespread industry interest in our progress. We have adopted a responsible, safety-first approach to developing this engine on account of ammonia’s particular risk-profile, and are confident that ammonia will ultimately become one of three major, alternative fuels in the market along with methanol and methane.” Christian Ludwig – Head of Two-Stroke Sales and Promotion – Everllence, said: “We have now been running our two-stroke ammonia test engine since 2023 and can confirm that the ME-LGIA’s combustion is right where we want it. Using the Diesel principle, the ME-LGIA engine concept has many of the same merits as our existing dual-fuel engines that already entered operation over a decade ago. Inspired by these engines, we are – among other innovations – using the same sealing-oil design for the fuel-booster injection valves as this has proven to be particularly important and efficient. By end-2026, we tentatively expect to have a small number of demonstration projects on the water to enable a commercial market introduction of the G50-, S60-, G60-, G70- and G80-bore ME-LGIA engines based on positive service experience.” Aurora class Höegh’s Aurora Class will be the largest and most environmentally friendly PCTC ever built, further accelerating Höegh Autoliners’ decarbonisation efforts and setting a new standard for more sustainable deep-sea transportation.

National Security Leaders Underscore Need to Move at Speed of Technology,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/national-security-leaders-underscore-need-to-move-at-speed-of-technology,,30/08/2025 13:45:20,,"[By: SENEDIA] SENEDIA, the Alliance for Defense Tech, Talent, and Innovation, yesterday concluded Defense Innovation Days, a signature national event that attracted nearly 400 of the most important decisionmakers and innovators in the defense industry. ""It is more important today than any time in our history that we have the capacity and skills to not only be competitive with other countries, but to far exceed them,” said Senator Jack Reed (RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Reed called on the defense industry leaders in attendance to continue to advance American innovation and security. “What you do ultimately ensures the safety and security of our men and women in uniform across the world. This is a common purpose we share.” Distinguished speakers at the 11th annual sold-out event represented decades of experience across Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and private sector service, including RDML Peter Small, Chief Engineer and Commander of NAVSEA Warfare Centers; Dr. Andrew Erickson, Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute; Dr. Michael Winter, Chief Scientist, RTX; COL David Brown (ret.), Naval War College Center for Irregular Warfare and Armed Groups; LtGen Eric E. Austin, Deputy Commander, Combat Development and Integration, US Marine Corps Combat Development Command, and BG Chris Hackler, Deputy Commanding General, US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. Panels included “Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet” and “Mastering the Depths: Navigating the Engineering Battlespace.” Key takeaways from this year’s event are: “More than a decade after we hosted the first Defense Innovation Days, SENEDIA continues to see the critical need to bring together industry and government, civilian and military leaders to connect, collaborate with one another, and ultimately innovate in service of our national security,” said Molly Donohue Magee, Chief Executive Officer of SENEDIA. “Investing in defense is an economic, workforce, and national security imperative.” More from Defense Innovation Days An Increasingly Challenging and Complex Environment Rapid advancements in technology have made internal research and development processes more challenging and increased external and geopolitical pressures have likewise made the warfighting landscape more complex. A rise in authoritarianism around the globe represents a threat to American democracy – including from China. Returning to Defense Innovation Days, Dr. Erickson provided a deep dive into changes in the Chinese military. He said that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has removed large numbers of military, defense, and political officials, but warned that it does not signal a slowdown. To the contrary, Erickson called it “the most dramatic military build-up since World War II.” “China’s military capabilities development and operational readiness are clearly advancing rapidly across the board,” he said. “The speed and scope are breathtaking. That is what needs to inform our dedication, our sense of purpose, and the missions to which we are directed.” Several speakers noted the importance of the workforce to maintain American dominance. “The Navy faces an urgent imperative to increase our capabilities, and our people are our biggest asset,” said RDML Small. “It's not just the trades we need to strengthen. We need to rebuild the national maritime engineering workforce. A tremendous national effort to rebuild this workforce is underway.” The Unmanned and Undersea Advantage The United States submarine program is widely viewed as the greatest deterrent to American adversaries, and two panel discussions focused on undersea challenges and opportunities in an ever-changing maritime landscape. Several speakers used the ongoing conflict in the Black Sea as an illustration of how maritime strategy is changing, where Ukraine has used naval drones to stave off a strong Russian Navy. The Mastering the Depths panel was moderated by Marie Bussiere, the Technical Director of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport. She was joined on the stage by NUWC colleagues Mark Vacarro, Director of the Subsea and Seabed Warfare SSTM; Steve Plunkett, Next Generation Weapons and Defensive Systems SSTM; Steve Lamb, Chief of the Contracting Office, and CDR Shawn Stelzel of the Undersea Warfighting Development Center. Collectively, they urged industry leaders – especially those who have yet to engage with NUWC – to consider delivering their best-in-class tools and technology for defense applications. “To maintain the undersea advantage, we need to get solutions into the hands of the fleet faster,” Bussiere said. On the Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet panel, CAPT Colin Corridan (ret.), the former leader of Task Force 59, the Navy’s first maritime robotics and AI task force, moderated a panel that included Commander David Brannighan, Royal Navy, British Defence Staff USA, and Austin Gray, Co-Founder and CSO, Blue Water Autonomy. One takeaway of the panel included a charge to industry to apply their solutions to national security and help ensure a high-low procurement strategy that is diversified between advanced yet expensive high-end systems and cheaper, more flexible low-end systems. Moving at the Speed of Technology Across all three days, multiple speakers talked about the need to move faster – from harnessing AI and new technology to developing and quickly scaling new capabilities – to ensure our warfighters have the systems and tools they need when they need them. Just as undersea technology has changed the maritime landscape, COL Brown (ret.) pointed to drones as a comparable example of how airpower has been democratized. Beyond weapons, he also warned about disinformation as a weapon of war and how increasingly convincing deepfakes are making it difficult for military leaders and civilians alike to distinguish the truth. “We are entering an era of breathtaking technological advancement,” he said. “The warning of history is clear: Unless we adapt, the upheavals of the last century may pale in comparison to what lies ahead.” LtGen Austin and BG Hackler agreed on the importance of government and industry collaboration. Speed to execution must consider future changes in technology. Dr. Winter shared that RTX has introduced a new military engine nearly every decade over the last century. Looking forward, RTX and other Primes – as well as the supply chain companies that support them – must bring together the digital thread, relying on model-based systems engineering that allows for greater efficiency and responsiveness. “It is critical that we build these tools with enough longevity and enough forethought,” he said. Other speakers featured at Defense Innovation Days included Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), Congressman Seth Magaziner (RI-02); and Congressman Gabe Amo (RI-01). Thanks to Our Sponsors Sponsors for Defense Innovation Days 2025 include Platinum Sponsors General Dynamics, RTX, and the Undersea Technology Innovation Consortium.

Zelim Urges Use of Situational Awareness Technology to Prevent Collisions,https://maritime-executive.com/article/zelim-urges-use-of-situational-awareness-technology-to-prevent-collisions,,04/09/2025 06:51:49,,"[By: Zelim] Zelim, the Edinburgh-headquartered maritime safety and security innovator, is calling for the mandatory adoption of advanced situational awareness technology to help prevent ship collisions, reduce fatalities, and improve operational safety at sea. The call follows the recent publication of the Marine Accident Investigations Board’s (MAIB) 2024 Annual Report, which noted: “We need to radically rethink the role of human watchkeepers in the digital age. Humans do not make good monitors and if under-stimulated, they will find other things to occupy themselves.” This was also reinforced in MAIB's preliminary report on the Solong and Stena Immaculate incident in the North Sea, where the lack of real-time situational awareness contributed to the severity of events. On 10 March 2025, the Portugal-registered container ship MV Solong collided with the anchored oil tanker Stena Immaculate near the Humber Estuary, rupturing a cargo tank and triggering a major fire. Thirty-six crew were rescued; one seafarer remains missing and presumed dead. Zelim CEO, Sam Mayall, said: “We wholeheartedly support the MAIB’s position on this. By combining AI-powered cameras and real-time alerting, advanced technologies such as our ZOE system can help crews act faster, prevent incidents from escalating, and provide trusted records post-event. Beyond preventing collisions and man-overboard incidents, these systems can also provide critical forensic data to support investigations and regulatory compliance. Crucially, today’s situational awareness technology reduces reliance on human vigilance alone, allowing crews to focus where their judgment and experience matter most.” India has already taken decisive action to reduce the risk of collision and lives lost to man-overboard incidents. Earlier this year, its Directorate General of Shipping mandated CCTV systems on all domestic vessels of 500 GT and above, with full implementation required by 2028. The regulation specifies comprehensive camera placement, resolution standards, and integration with AI-based monitoring. It is designed not just for surveillance, but for proactive detection, tracking, and alerting to protect lives at sea. “Voluntary measures are no longer enough. To strengthen safety and security at sea, global regulators must follow India’s lead and mandate advanced situational awareness solutions. Smarter ships result in safer sea,” added Mayall.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 15:39:08

ATSB: Livestock Carrier's Engine Failed Due to Poor Maintenance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/atsb-livestock-carrier-s-engine-failed-due-to-poor-maintenance,,04/09/2025 05:44:35,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has released its final report on the engine failure of a livestock carrier that has been banned from entering the country due to persistent safety shortcomings. The report shows that lack of proper maintenance caused the engine failure of the Al Messilah while it was entering the Port of Fremantle, a malfunction that led to loss of propulsion twice in quick succession. Converted into a livestock carrier in 1997 at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany, the Al Messilah regularly traded between Fremantle and Shuwaikh, Kuwait. She was equipped with a Mitsui B&W main engine that delivered about 16,000 horsepower through a fixed pitch propeller. On March 4, Al Messilah lost propulsion about one mile outside the port. The main engine stopped while the vessel was entering the harbor, and was briefly restarted. However, the engine failed again shortly after, leaving the ship without propulsion while transiting the inner harbor. With tug assistance, the ship was maneuvered safely to berth, bringing what could have been a dangerous situation to a safe conclusion. While the two incidents of engine failure were troubling enough, ATSB faulted the marine pilot for failing to follow standard communications protocols. When the ship lost propulsion, the pilot tried to contact the VTS service via VHF channel 8, the working channel for tugs. The VTS center follows the international standard and monitors channel 12, so the distress call was not received, delaying proper coordination. The pilotage provider, Fremantle Pilots, routinely used VHF channel 8 for all pilotage communications in the harbor, expecting it to be monitored by all parties including VTS. Though the incident was a close call, another incident was to occur during Al Messilah's next port visit to Fremantle in April. The ship experienced a complete electrical power loss and black smoke emanated from the engine room, with the cause being attributed to a generator failure. The failure was most likely due to the degradation of the electrical cable insulation, caused by continuous movement due to poor securing, leading to a short circuit in the system. With multiple safety-related deficiencies being identified during a harbor master inspection, along with systemic shortcomings, including failure to report key incidents such as a mooring line parting and onboard fire, the vessel was banned from entering Australia. In its final report on the March 4 incident, ATSB established that the engine failure of the 1980-built and Kuwait-flagged livestock carrier was most likely caused by a malfunction of the main air distributor’s servo piston within the engine’s pneumatic control system. Degraded seals inside the servo piston allowed control air to leak between the ahead and astern chambers of the reversing air cylinder. This leakage introduced air into the astern line of the camshaft reversing mechanism. This likely resulted in the system not being able to maintain the control air pressure needed to fully actuate and hold the camshaft in the ahead position. The camshaft then likely moved to an indeterminate position, which misaligned the fuel injection and exhaust valve timing. This resulted in the engine misfiring and stopping. The engine failure was an incident in waiting owing to the fact that the main air distributor components, the main engine pneumatic system, and the engine control air system dryer were not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. The vessel’s owner and operator, the Kuwait Livestock Transport & Trading Company, came under criticism because its planned maintenance system (PMS) did not provide enough detail to track maintenance schedules, and did not have a specific maintenance item to record the maintenance activities on the main engine pneumatic system. “A comprehensive and well?documented PMS is important to ensure the reliability of critical machinery, particularly systems that directly affect a ship’s maneuverability and safety,” said Angus Mitchell, ATSB Chief Commissioner. According to the investigation, failure by marine pilots to follow communication protocols was another factor that increased risk. Fremantle Ports’ formal protocols designated VHF channel 12 as the primary channel for vessel traffic service (VTS) communications, and channel 8 for towage operations.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 15:39:08
Glamox Provides Advanced Helicopter Landing Systems for Royal Navy Warships,https://maritime-executive.com/article/glamox-provides-advanced-helicopter-landing-systems-for-royal-navy-warships,,04/09/2025 05:11:44,,"[By: Glamox] Glamox, a world leader in lighting, has enhanced the capabilities of the Royal Navy’s Offshore Patrol Vessels, HMS Trent and HMS Spey, to land helicopters on a moving deck in challenging weather and during night conditions. HMS Trent was the first vessel to be equipped with the advanced Helicopter Visual Landing Aid System (HVLAS), which underwent rigorous testing off the English south coast in July, involving three days of day and night landings from a Wildcat helicopter. HMS Spey is the next in line to be fitted with the system. Additionally, Glamox supplied both vessels with military-grade Night Vision Imaging System navigation lights. The HVLAS is a comprehensive flight deck-based lighting system that provides pilots with visual cues and information during approach and landing. It includes a stabilised horizon bar that shows pilots the position of the horizon, regardless of the roll and pitch of the vessel. A glide path indicator assists pilots in judging approach angles using a three-colour light beam to show the correct path or whether the helicopter is too high or too low. Additional deck-edge lighting and focused LED beam lines provide accurate positional cues for pilots operating in low-visibility conditions or using night vision goggles. See the video. The lighting system includes controls to dim or adjust the lighting intensity for improved visibility. This means that the ship can support covert missions, operating in near-dark conditions, and the lighting can be tuned to meet the operational requirements of helicopters from other forces. “The fact that we now have the ability to control our lights in such a different manner will mean that the ability for partner nations to land helicopters will be significantly easier,” said Lieutenant Harry Jukes, HMS Trent’s Weapon Engineer Officer, interviewed by the British Forces Broadcast Service. Following HMS Trent’s refit in Malta and the successful validation of the system at sea, the vessel is expected to be deployed to the Caribbean, where it can support various missions from counter-narcotics to humanitarian aid. The HVLAS for HMS Spey will be fitted in Singapore during its scheduled maintenance period. The Royal Navy has a further three Batch 2 River Class Offshore Patrol Vessels that could benefit from the system. “This is the first time that Royal Navy Ships have had an HVLAS retrofit, and we are delighted with the results. The new technology greatly extends the capabilities of the Offshore Patrol Vessels to conduct helicopter operations at night and in bad weather conditions,” said Ronny Orvik, head of Glamox’s Defence & Security business. “Furthermore, this major update underscores the value of the Defence Equipment & Support arm of the UK’s Ministry of Defence in keeping its ships at the forefront of advanced technology.”",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 15:39:08

Houthis Attempt to Increase Attacks on Shipping After Israeli Actions,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/houthis-attempt-to-increase-attacks-on-shipping-after-israeli-actions,,04/09/2025 20:28:03,,"The Houthi militants have not made new threats against shipping, but there appears to be another increase in activity both against Israel and shipping that it links to Israel. It comes after the Israelis renewed their statements vowing to stop the Houthi aggression after the militants started to use missiles with cluster bombs. UK Maritime Trade Operations issued a new warning of suspicious activity today, September 4, after receiving reports from an unnamed vessel in the Red Sea. The vessel’s master informed the tracking operations that “an unknown projectile” hit the sea at “some distance” from the vessel. The ship and its crew were reported uninjured and proceeding. The incident took place while the ship was approximately 178 nautical miles northwest of Hudaydah, Yemen, in the Red Sea north of the Bab al-Mandeb strait. The warning also states that the master said the vessel had experienced “severe electronic interference” while it was transiting in the region. UKMTO is advising caution during transits. The attack came as Lloyd’s List published new data showing that the number of vessels making the Red Sea transit increased last month. They calculate that transits were at their highest level since January 2024, and they cite increases from LPG tankers and bulkers, as well as the transits by tankers. The container carriers have continued to mostly divert their vessels around Africa. UKMTO numbers today’s incident as the thirtieth of 2025 after well over 100 in 2024. However, there had been a lull after the Houthis took credit for sinking two bulk carriers, Magic Seas and Eternity C, in July. Last week, Israel responded to what it said was the first attack using cluster weapons. After threatening the leadership of the Houthis, Israel attacked, killing one of the group’s senior leaders, the self-declared prime minister of the Houthis, Ahmed al-Rahawi. Associated Press determined, based on photos, that there were a total of 11 coffins in the funeral processional on Monday. The day before, the Liberian-registered chemical tanker Scarlet Ray also reported a missile had splashed near the vessel and exploded. The Houthis claimed they struck the vessel, which is operated by Eastern Pacific, the Idan Ofer company. Eastern Pacific later also reported the vessel had not sustained damage. The Houthis also made a claim on Tuesday, September 2, to have struck the MSC Aby (110,387 dwt / 9648 TEU). The unconfirmed report, which was dismissed by security consultants as likely false, said they had launched two drones and a missile that struck the containership in the Northern Red Sea. The ship, according to MSC’s published schedule, was due in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Analysts have raised concern, however, that the Houthis have extended the reach of their attacks further north into the Red Sea, threatening the region near Saudi Arabia. Last year’s attacks were mostly in the southern Red Sea near the strait or in the Gulf of Aden. While there have been reports of attacks on shipping in recent days, the group is focused mostly on Israel. Today, September 4, they claimed another missile launch, which reports say the Israelis intercepted. Analysts note, however, that the launches directed at Israel are coming at an increased frequency, either daily or multiple times in a day. The Israelis have again made public statements that they will increase their response to stop the launches.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
"Rubio: Military Strikes on Suspected Drug Boats ""Will Happen Again""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/rubio-military-strikes-on-suspected-drug-boats-will-happen-again,,04/09/2025 06:56:45,,"The Trump administration plans to keep attacking drug boats with lethal military force, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday. ""The United States has long — for many, many years — established intelligence that allowed us to interdict and stop drug boats. And we did that. And it doesn’t work. Interdiction doesn’t work,"" Rubio said at a press conference in Mexico City. ""What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them."" The administration has deployed a large task force to waters of the southern Caribbean, and is testing a new, militarized approach to trafficking enforcement. On Tuesday, the White House announced that a boat allegedly transporting narcotics off Venezuela had been eliminated in a strike; 11 suspects were killed, the administration said, and no survivors were reported. According to the White House, the boat was transporting drugs for the Tren de Aragua gang, designated by the Trump administration as a foreign terrorist organization. Rubio said Tuesday that the vessel was likely headed to Trinidad or another country in the Caribbean. He expressed certainty that the drugs were headed for the United States; the same route is also commonly used on the circuitous drug pipeline to European markets, where cocaine fetches a higher value. The president personally authorized the attack on the suspect boat, Rubio told reporters. ""On the president’s orders, we blew it up. And it will happen again,"" Rubio said. ""Maybe it’s happening right now. I don’t know."" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sounded a similar note in an interview on Fox and Friends. ""This is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won’t stop with just this strike,"" he said. Reactions to the new approach have been mixed. Many legal experts suggest that executing suspects on the high seas without a boarding or a trial may expose the administration to war crimes charges, particularly if done for an offense that is not normally punishable by death. ""Destroying a boat at sea without boarding or verifying opens the door to tragedy,"" said Juan S. Gonzalez, former senior director of the National Security Council under former President Joe Biden. ""The USCG - not the Navy - is the right tool for counter-narcotics in the Caribbean."" However, some regional leaders are all too happy to see a new emphasis on lethality in countering the drug trade at sea. Military methods are already common for shoreside counternarcotics agencies in Latin America, matching the militarized nature of the cartels. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, said Tuesday that she supported the Trump administration's new approach. ""The pain and suffering the cartels have inflicted on our nation is immense. I have no sympathy for traffickers; the US military should kill them all violently,"" she said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Zelim Urges Use of Situational Awareness Technology to Prevent Collisions,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/zelim-urges-use-of-situational-awareness-technology-to-prevent-collisions,,04/09/2025 06:51:49,,"[By: Zelim] Zelim, the Edinburgh-headquartered maritime safety and security innovator, is calling for the mandatory adoption of advanced situational awareness technology to help prevent ship collisions, reduce fatalities, and improve operational safety at sea. The call follows the recent publication of the Marine Accident Investigations Board’s (MAIB) 2024 Annual Report, which noted: “We need to radically rethink the role of human watchkeepers in the digital age. Humans do not make good monitors and if under-stimulated, they will find other things to occupy themselves.” This was also reinforced in MAIB's preliminary report on the Solong and Stena Immaculate incident in the North Sea, where the lack of real-time situational awareness contributed to the severity of events. On 10 March 2025, the Portugal-registered container ship MV Solong collided with the anchored oil tanker Stena Immaculate near the Humber Estuary, rupturing a cargo tank and triggering a major fire. Thirty-six crew were rescued; one seafarer remains missing and presumed dead. Zelim CEO, Sam Mayall, said: “We wholeheartedly support the MAIB’s position on this. By combining AI-powered cameras and real-time alerting, advanced technologies such as our ZOE system can help crews act faster, prevent incidents from escalating, and provide trusted records post-event. Beyond preventing collisions and man-overboard incidents, these systems can also provide critical forensic data to support investigations and regulatory compliance. Crucially, today’s situational awareness technology reduces reliance on human vigilance alone, allowing crews to focus where their judgment and experience matter most.” India has already taken decisive action to reduce the risk of collision and lives lost to man-overboard incidents. Earlier this year, its Directorate General of Shipping mandated CCTV systems on all domestic vessels of 500 GT and above, with full implementation required by 2028. The regulation specifies comprehensive camera placement, resolution standards, and integration with AI-based monitoring. It is designed not just for surveillance, but for proactive detection, tracking, and alerting to protect lives at sea. “Voluntary measures are no longer enough. To strengthen safety and security at sea, global regulators must follow India’s lead and mandate advanced situational awareness solutions. Smarter ships result in safer sea,” added Mayall.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25

ATSB: Livestock Carrier's Engine Failed Due to Poor Maintenance,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/atsb-livestock-carrier-s-engine-failed-due-to-poor-maintenance,,04/09/2025 05:44:35,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has released its final report on the engine failure of a livestock carrier that has been banned from entering the country due to persistent safety shortcomings. The report shows that lack of proper maintenance caused the engine failure of the Al Messilah while it was entering the Port of Fremantle, a malfunction that led to loss of propulsion twice in quick succession. Converted into a livestock carrier in 1997 at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany, the Al Messilah regularly traded between Fremantle and Shuwaikh, Kuwait. She was equipped with a Mitsui B&W main engine that delivered about 16,000 horsepower through a fixed pitch propeller. On March 4, Al Messilah lost propulsion about one mile outside the port. The main engine stopped while the vessel was entering the harbor, and was briefly restarted. However, the engine failed again shortly after, leaving the ship without propulsion while transiting the inner harbor. With tug assistance, the ship was maneuvered safely to berth, bringing what could have been a dangerous situation to a safe conclusion. While the two incidents of engine failure were troubling enough, ATSB faulted the marine pilot for failing to follow standard communications protocols. When the ship lost propulsion, the pilot tried to contact the VTS service via VHF channel 8, the working channel for tugs. The VTS center follows the international standard and monitors channel 12, so the distress call was not received, delaying proper coordination. The pilotage provider, Fremantle Pilots, routinely used VHF channel 8 for all pilotage communications in the harbor, expecting it to be monitored by all parties including VTS. Though the incident was a close call, another incident was to occur during Al Messilah's next port visit to Fremantle in April. The ship experienced a complete electrical power loss and black smoke emanated from the engine room, with the cause being attributed to a generator failure. The failure was most likely due to the degradation of the electrical cable insulation, caused by continuous movement due to poor securing, leading to a short circuit in the system. With multiple safety-related deficiencies being identified during a harbor master inspection, along with systemic shortcomings, including failure to report key incidents such as a mooring line parting and onboard fire, the vessel was banned from entering Australia. In its final report on the March 4 incident, ATSB established that the engine failure of the 1980-built and Kuwait-flagged livestock carrier was most likely caused by a malfunction of the main air distributor’s servo piston within the engine’s pneumatic control system. Degraded seals inside the servo piston allowed control air to leak between the ahead and astern chambers of the reversing air cylinder. This leakage introduced air into the astern line of the camshaft reversing mechanism. This likely resulted in the system not being able to maintain the control air pressure needed to fully actuate and hold the camshaft in the ahead position. The camshaft then likely moved to an indeterminate position, which misaligned the fuel injection and exhaust valve timing. This resulted in the engine misfiring and stopping. The engine failure was an incident in waiting owing to the fact that the main air distributor components, the main engine pneumatic system, and the engine control air system dryer were not maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. The vessel’s owner and operator, the Kuwait Livestock Transport & Trading Company, came under criticism because its planned maintenance system (PMS) did not provide enough detail to track maintenance schedules, and did not have a specific maintenance item to record the maintenance activities on the main engine pneumatic system. “A comprehensive and well?documented PMS is important to ensure the reliability of critical machinery, particularly systems that directly affect a ship’s maneuverability and safety,” said Angus Mitchell, ATSB Chief Commissioner. According to the investigation, failure by marine pilots to follow communication protocols was another factor that increased risk. Fremantle Ports’ formal protocols designated VHF channel 12 as the primary channel for vessel traffic service (VTS) communications, and channel 8 for towage operations.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Glamox Provides Advanced Helicopter Landing Systems for Royal Navy Warships,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/glamox-provides-advanced-helicopter-landing-systems-for-royal-navy-warships,,04/09/2025 05:11:44,,"[By: Glamox] Glamox, a world leader in lighting, has enhanced the capabilities of the Royal Navy’s Offshore Patrol Vessels, HMS Trent and HMS Spey, to land helicopters on a moving deck in challenging weather and during night conditions. HMS Trent was the first vessel to be equipped with the advanced Helicopter Visual Landing Aid System (HVLAS), which underwent rigorous testing off the English south coast in July, involving three days of day and night landings from a Wildcat helicopter. HMS Spey is the next in line to be fitted with the system. Additionally, Glamox supplied both vessels with military-grade Night Vision Imaging System navigation lights. The HVLAS is a comprehensive flight deck-based lighting system that provides pilots with visual cues and information during approach and landing. It includes a stabilised horizon bar that shows pilots the position of the horizon, regardless of the roll and pitch of the vessel. A glide path indicator assists pilots in judging approach angles using a three-colour light beam to show the correct path or whether the helicopter is too high or too low. Additional deck-edge lighting and focused LED beam lines provide accurate positional cues for pilots operating in low-visibility conditions or using night vision goggles. See the video. The lighting system includes controls to dim or adjust the lighting intensity for improved visibility. This means that the ship can support covert missions, operating in near-dark conditions, and the lighting can be tuned to meet the operational requirements of helicopters from other forces. “The fact that we now have the ability to control our lights in such a different manner will mean that the ability for partner nations to land helicopters will be significantly easier,” said Lieutenant Harry Jukes, HMS Trent’s Weapon Engineer Officer, interviewed by the British Forces Broadcast Service. Following HMS Trent’s refit in Malta and the successful validation of the system at sea, the vessel is expected to be deployed to the Caribbean, where it can support various missions from counter-narcotics to humanitarian aid. The HVLAS for HMS Spey will be fitted in Singapore during its scheduled maintenance period. The Royal Navy has a further three Batch 2 River Class Offshore Patrol Vessels that could benefit from the system. “This is the first time that Royal Navy Ships have had an HVLAS retrofit, and we are delighted with the results. The new technology greatly extends the capabilities of the Offshore Patrol Vessels to conduct helicopter operations at night and in bad weather conditions,” said Ronny Orvik, head of Glamox’s Defence & Security business. “Furthermore, this major update underscores the value of the Defence Equipment & Support arm of the UK’s Ministry of Defence in keeping its ships at the forefront of advanced technology.”",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
U.S. Coast Guard Keeps Close Watch on Chinese Icebreakers off Alaska,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-keeps-close-watch-on-chinese-icebreakers-off-alaska,,04/09/2025 04:10:49,,"The U.S. Coast Guard has been closely watching China's Arctic research flotilla for the past month, and continues to monitor the operations of two Chinese-flagged vessels in waters of the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf - outside the bounds of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, but inside the limits of U.S. seabed mineral claims. The medium icebreaker USCGC Healy has been operating in the region to provide presence and surveillance, and for the last week, Healy's crew has been monitoring the movements of the Soviet-built icebreaking tug Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di (flagged with the Liberian registry) and the brand new ice-class research vessel Jidi. Both were encountered in an area of the ECS about 200-250 nautical miles to the north of Utqiagvik, Alaska, a small coastal village on the Beaufort Sea. On Tuesday, USCGC Healy - supported by a Hercules long-range SAR aircraft out of Air Station Kodiak - responded to intercept Jidi, and the crew monitored and queried the vessel. Healy intercepted Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di on Sunday. “This operation highlights the value of our ice-capable fleet,” said Rear Adm. Bob Little, commander, U.S. Coast Guard Arctic District. “The U.S. Coast Guard is controlling, securing, and defending the northern U.S. border and maritime approaches in the Arctic to protect U.S. sovereignty, and Healy’s operations demonstrate the critical need for more Coast Guard icebreakers to achieve that.” Healy is one of the Coast Guard's two purpose-built oceangoing icebreakers. The ""interim icebreaker"" USCGC Storis, which began life as an offshore vessel and is currently operated by a civilian merchant mariner crew, is nearby in the Bering Sea. USCGC Waesche, a National Security Cutter, is also in the region and has accompanied Healy for part of the mission. In addition to Jidi and Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di, the flotilla of Chinese vessels recently spotted in the far north includes the Polar Class 3 icebreaker Xue Long 2; the new research vessel Tan Suo San Hao; and the Shen Hai Yi Hao, a conventional research vessel built to carry a deep-diving submersible. In response to the increasing competition in the Arctic, the Trump administration is giving the Coast Guard more resources to expand its presence. With U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funding, it is expanding the small port of Nome, Alaska at the north end of the Bering Sea, specifically to accommodate Coast Guard icebreakers. And to expand the icebreaking fleet, the administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains $4.3 billion to pay for the service's future heavy icebreaker series, the Polar Security Cutter, plus $3.5 billion more for a medium icebreaker series.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25

That was 51 years ago. Since then, she has sailed aboard oil tankers for Gulf and Sunoco, come shoreside with Sunoco as a regulatory and government affairs official, earned a law degree at night from Widener University and in 1997 accepted an invitation from Joe Cox, the long-time President & CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA), to join the Chamber as Director of Maritime Affairs. Eighteen years later, in 2015, she succeeded Cox as President & CEO of CSA. At each step of the way, she's demonstrated that the maritime industry is not just a ""man's world"" and that there's plenty of room for women too. Not that she wanted any special treatment, just a fair shot. And she has excelled at every stage of the journey with her common-sense intelligence, interpersonal skills, quick wit and sense of fairness. In July, Kathy stepped down as President & CEO and handed the reins to her more-than-capable #2, Sean Kline. She will stay on as President Emeritus, working with CSA members on technical and regulatory issues. ""It's not 'goodbye,'"" she says, ""but 'see ya around.'"" Welcome, Kathy! We're so honored to have you. Tell our readers more about yourself. What attracted you to the maritime industry? It was a bit of a circuitous route. I originally wanted to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and received nominations to West Point, Annapolis and the Air Force Academy. I was, alas, born too soon and received letters from all three explaining that they were not accepting women for the incoming classes in 1972. Changing direction, I attended the University of Delaware for two years and in the fall of my second year received a call on my dorm phone (yes, it really was a pay phone) from a young Senator from Delaware by the name of Joe Biden. He explained to me that the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy was accepting women in the summer of 1974 and asked if I was interested. My parents and I visited Kings Point the following weekend, and I made the decision to enter in that first class with women in the summer of 1974 and graduated in 1978. I will always be grateful to Senator Biden for giving me this incredible opportunity. My intention was to go active-duty Navy upon graduation, but during my time at Kings Point I realized what a great industry this is and have stayed in it for 51 years. Remarkable! You then sailed for a while. Were there lessons at sea that transferred to your shore jobs? Lessons learned during my sailing days helped provide me with the confidence and judgment to tackle whatever new challenges lay ahead. They also endowed me with a mariner's perspective of ship operations, which is critical for a successful move to shoreside management positions. Throughout my shoreside career which included obtaining a law degree, I've always been a mariner first and have taken that perspective into account, recognizing that the linchpin to any successful shipping endeavor are the mariners that make it happen. Excellent! Tell our readers about the Chamber of Shipping of America. What does it do and what is its history? The Chamber of Shipping of America (CSA) is the U.S. national shipowners association. For over 100 years, it's represented the interests of shipowners, operators and charterers in the U.S. and internationally at IMO and ILO. Our members own/operate/charter all types of vessels, both U.S. and non-U.S. flagged, engaged in the U.S. domestic and international trades, and we represent them before legislative and regulatory bodies. Our primary focus is to advise them on current compliance challenges as well as future compliance issues coming down the road. What are some of those issues? There are many, but the most important are the global move toward decarbonization of the shipping industry, the risks to shipping from geopolitical challenges (Ukraine/Russia, Middle East), global trade issues including the U.S. Trade Representative's proposal to impose port fees on certain vessels, cybersecurity and simply keeping up to date on new requirements imposed on shipping at the global, national and, in some cases, sub-national levels. What's the relationship between CSA and the International Chamber of Shipping in London? CSA is a founding member of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and serves as the U.S. representative on all ICS bodies including the Board of Directors, the Marine Committee, the Maritime Law Committee and the Shipping Policy Committee. CSA also serves on the ICS delegation to IMO meetings. We collaborate on a number of issues at IMO and in the U.S. impacting the industry. You must be excited about the SHIPS for America Act and the Trump Administration's commitment to ""Making Maritime Great Again."" Absolutely! I remember in 1978, when I graduated from Kings Point, there were hundreds of U.S.-flag vessels trading internationally. Over the last five decades, we've allowed our commercial shipbuilding and U.S.-flag international fleet to shrink to unacceptable levels as regards national and economic security – due principally to neglect. With thanks to the President, Senators Mark Kelly and Todd Young and Representatives Trent Kelly and John Garamendi, the industry is in the first stages of revitalization. It took us a long time to get to where we are now, and it will take some time to bring the industry back. What is desperately needed is a leader (champion!) who can bring all these stakeholders and programs together across the legislative and executive branches and that position, in my opinion, needs to be in the White House. What will it take to make the dream of a 250-vessel fleet a reality? That's a tough one to answer. We obviously need more U.S. shipyards, shipyard workers and ultimately more mariners to man these vessels. Less obvious, but just as important, is the need to create a business environment where U.S. shipyards and U.S.-flag vessels can compete in the international marketplace. This will likely be accomplished through a combination of public funding (subsidies in one form or another) and private sector investment. Ultimately, we need cargo. All these new ships and mariners won't make a difference if the cargo isn't there! Where will the mariners come from? How can we make maritime a more attractive career choice for the next generation? We've been trying to address this challenge for years. First, we need a comprehensive outreach program that makes the general public aware of just how important the commercial maritime industry is to our national economy and security. Second, we need an equally comprehensive outreach program for kids in middle school through high school to introduce them to the opportunities in the maritime industry. And third, we're losing maritime academy graduates to the tech sector in significant numbers and have to figure out a way to make maritime jobs more attractive. Salaries between the maritime and tech industries are comparable, but tech doesn't require you to be away from home and family for six months of the year. What is the future of the Jones Act? Will it have to be modified in some way to accommodate the new push? CSA supports the Jones Act in its current form. Keep in mind that the SHIPS for America Act is focused on building the U.S.-flag internationally trading fleet, so I don't see what modifications would be necessary since the U.S. build requirement would not apply to U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international trade. This allows for the reflagging of foreign-built vessels into the U.S. flag international fleet. You've been a trailblazer – a woman in a man's world – your entire life. What's it been like? How do you see the future of women in maritime? I've never seen myself as a trailblazer. I was just a lucky person who happened to be in the right place at the right time. All I wanted was a fair chance to succeed in a career that at the time had very few women. I got that fair chance, and it was up to me to take advantage of the opportunities before me. I could not have succeeded without my brothers (and sisters) at Kings Point and later in the industry that provided support and encouragement. From my perspective, success is not the result of one person's efforts. It's about your efforts and how you interact with the good people around you, including family, friends and professional colleagues. Are you a member of WISTA, the Women's International Shipping & Trading Association? I am a proud member of WISTA U.S.! WISTA is a unique organization that is obviously focused on women in the maritime industry but has grown to be much more than that. WISTA Sistas have welcomed WISTA Mistas, and the support, collaboration and friendships are unmatched by any other organization in which I have participated. Wonderful! Any final message for our readers? As someone in the latter stages of her career, I would like to send a message to the new generation of maritime professionals, including those in their early years at the academies: Make a plan with a pencil and eraser. The key to progress in life and in your career is how you adapt to change and react to new and unplanned opportunities.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Salvors Narrowly Avert a Capsizing After Trawler Burns at Pier in Ribeira,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-narrowly-avert-a-capsizing-after-trawler-burns-at-dock-in-ribeira,,04/09/2025 00:27:16,,"Salvors have successfully prevented the capsizing of a trawler at the port of Ribeira, Galicia, limiting the impact from a severe onboard fire. At about 1630 hours on Monday afternoon, the Mauritanian-flagged fishing vessel Awadi caught fire alongside the pier in Barbanza, Galicia. The blaze started in a hold, where maintenance work was under way. A bystander reported the incident to local emergency responders, and shoreside fire teams began work to suppress the blaze and prevent the risk of spreading the fire to nearby ships. No injuries were reported on board. The response effort drew in five fire trucks and crews from around the region, as well as coast guard and environmental agency representatives. Efforts to control the spread of the blaze on board were not successful, and it expanded through multiple compartments.

By late Tuesday, it was listing 40 degrees to starboard, and salvors began working to find the cause. It turned out that the bilge system for the hold was admitting water into the compartment, according to Diario de Arousa, so divers were sent below to plug it and halt the water ingress. Firefighters also removed all of their own gear and all of the stores from the weather deck in order to improve the vessel's stability, and they reduced the amount of water they were introducing inside the ship. The list has stabilized but the fire is still smoldering, port director Juan Sanmartin told local media, adding that it will likely continue to do so for several days until the flammable stores inside the vessel are consumed. So far, no pollution has been reported, but the ship has 18,000 liters of diesel on board and will need to be defueled. Once the emergency response is fully completed and the fire is out, an investigation into the cause of the casualty will begin. Port officials say that a stray welding spark may have started the fire, a constant risk during repair periods.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Russian Union Wins Compensation for Death Aboard a Sanctioned Tanker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russian-union-wins-compensation-for-death-aboard-a-sanctioned-tanker,,03/09/2025 23:41:06,,"The Russian Seafarers' Union (SUR) has begun publicizing cases of labor rights enforcement against ""shadow fleet"" tankers, the lightly-regulated and questionably-insured vessels that carry most of Russia's oil to market. The calibrated ""price cap"" G7 sanction regime has restricted Russia's access to Western tanker owners and insurers, creating business opportunities for anonymous players who operate along the edges of maritime law and practice - and are occasionally caught shorting their seafarers. Last month, the SUR reported that it had secured the detention of the tanker Unity, a sanctioned vessel owned in Moscow and managed in the UAE. Russian enforcement actions against the Russia-facing shadow fleet are rare, but SUR convinced the port captain in Murmansk to detain Unity for multiple violations, including an estimated $90,000 in unpaid back wages. The vessel had just changed legal owner, flag state and insurer, and the crew were concerned that their employment contracts would not be honored. On Monday, the SUR reported that its Black Sea branch had pursued compensation for the death of a second engineer aboard the tanker Sun (IMO 9293117). Like many shadow fleet vessels, Sun ""did not have a valid insurance policy,"" and the owner refused to pay any compensation to the seafarer's family. ""Not only was the amount of compensation for death not specified in the contract, but there was no information about insurance at all. In addition, it turned out that the insurance policy on the tanker was invalid,"" union official Alexey Belyakov reported. The union got involved in the matter at the family's request, and it reached out to the flag registry of Antigua and Barbuda. However, the registry said that Sun was no longer flagged in Antigua, so it could not assist. Sun's paperwork now declares that it is flagged in Benin, but shipping database Equasis records that this declaration is false - a common shadow fleet practice. Without help from the insurer or the flag state, the SUR reached out to Sun's owner. By the union's account, the shipowner ignored all requests and only got in touch when the union contacted the flag state. Then the owner brought in Turkish lawyers to negotiate, without success. At last, a representative of the shipowner in Russia joined the negotiations, and the SUR settled on a final payment of $125,000 for the family. In a statement, the union cautioned seafarers to read their employment contracts carefully before signing, with particular attention to insurance and medical care - and to contact their union for advice if there are red flags.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
IUMI: EV Fires Can Cause Explosions on Ro/Ros,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/iumi-ev-fires-can-cause-explosions-on-ro-ros,,03/09/2025 22:56:53,,"The International Union of Marine Insurers has updated its guidance to warn that PCTC and ropax operators run a risk of explosion during an onboard EV fire, a previously underexamined problem. Electric vehicle fires have been a major source of concern for ro/ro operators for years, and several operators have banned them from carriage. EV battery packs can self-ignite if cells overheat or develop internal faults; they can also catch fire from a nearby heat source, like a burning conventional vehicle. Once EV batteries enter thermal runaway, they burn at high temperature and are difficult to permanently extinguish. They also emit large quantities of toxic, flammable fumes, making hand-to-hand firefighting with a hose team even more challenging in the tight spaces of a full ro/ro deck. The industry has adapted its firefighting practices to account for the realities of EV blazes, and operators now favor shutting off ventilation and flooding the affected hold with the fixed CO2 system. This is IUMI's recommendation as well, and the organization recommends that ""fixed firefighting systems should be applied early, correctly and safely first rather than manual firefighting."" The ""early"" component of this advice is essential, IUMI says, because waiting could allow the blaze to grow to the point that the fixed system gets disabled by the fire or gets overwhelmed, with potentially catastrophic consequences. But this comes with its own risk, according to IUMI. At the right concentrations, the gases that are emitted from an EV battery pack are potentially explosive in combination with ambient atmosphere. Research suggests that the gas mix from an EV fire includes 30 percent hydrogen, which has high explosion potential. If these gases accumulate in an enclosed space without burning off, and mix with air in the right percentage, a blast could occur. Since the traditional fixed firefighting sequence starts with a full ventilation shutdown, before any CO2 is introduced, any gases from the fire would be trapped inside with air only for a period. ""A comprehensive firefighting strategy must not only consider the firefighting itself but also the management of potentially explosive gases that may accumulate during such incidents. The aim must be to integrate both aspects, firefighting and ventilation operation, without limiting the effectiveness of the overall firefighting system,"" IUMI cautioned. ""Careful consideration should be given by shipowners to appropriate ventilation procedures for the extinguishing system installed and the vessel concerned."" Modern PCTCs have another hazard that inverts typical thinking on marine firefighting. With their wide-open deck layouts, newer PCTCs have no partitions from the starboard bulkhead all the way across to the port side. In addition to the implications for ease of spreading fire, the design creates unique stability considerations. Getting the deck wet - even a little bit - can reduce the friction between car tires and deck surface enough that it creates the risk of a catastrophic cargo shift from one side to the other. If the lashings aren't enough to hold the vehicles in place, the PCTIC could take on a heavy list, with potentially serious consequences. This means that by and large, hose teams for boundary cooling are a restricted option on a PCTC. ""Only in calm weather (without swell and wind waves) locally applied small amounts of water can be recommended"" for boundary cooling on a PCTC deck, IUMI recommends.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Canada Moves its Coast Guard Into its Defense Ministry,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/canada-moves-coast-guard-out-of-regulatory-agency-into-defense-ministry,,03/09/2025 21:40:21,,"The Canadian Coast Guard has formally transferred out of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and into Canada's national defense establishment, expanding its role and adjusting its orientation. The transition brings the CCG's maritime domain experience into the mission of defending Canadian sovereignty, Canada's government said in a statement, much like the U.S. Coast Guard model. Some elements from Fisheries and Oceans Canada are also making the switch. The integration is intended to increase information-sharing and coordination between the CCG, Canada's Department of National Defense and the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) - but, unlike the USCG, the CCG will remain a civilian agency rather than a military branch. ""There are no plans to arm CCG personnel or assets, or to incorporate an additional enforcement role in the organization. The CCG will continue to deliver the essential services on which Canadians rely, including search and rescue, icebreaking, environmental conservation and protection, safe navigation, and supporting ocean science,"" said Minister of National Defense David McGuinty in a statement. A new bill before Canada's parliament would expand the CCG's national security role somewhat further, if passed. The Stronger Borders Act proposes to add (among other measures) maritime domain awareness responsibilities for the CCG, especially in the Canadian Arctic. In an era of increasing competition in the Arctic, and with the Northwest Passage increasingly accessible, tasking additional assets for monitoring in the remote far north could have security benefits. In the last election round earlier this year, Canada's Liberal party pledged to prepare the Canadian Coast guard for MDA activities and make it ready to support NATO operations. By doing so, Canada will now apply its existing coast guard spending towards its NATO defense spending target; Canada has long fallen short of the NATO readiness contribution target, which was set at two percent of GDP in 2014 and is now set to rise to five percent by 2035.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Floating Data Centers on Fast-Flowing Rivers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/floating-data-centers-on-fast-flowing-rivers,,03/09/2025 20:15:19,,"Advances in information processing technology and programming have increased the need for data centers capable of processing massive volumes of information. Data centers that float on water provide ready access to cooling capacity, with potential to convert the energy from sea waves and river currents to electrical energy to operate the onboard technology. Introduction Data centers process massive amounts of information and require continuous and reliable access to large amounts of electric power and substantial cooling capacity. When located on land in arid regions where solar photovoltaic energy is available, data centers require roof-mounted air-cooling technology that consumes massive amounts of electrical power. While waterfront coastal locations provide easy and available access to water cooling, market demand for such locations is very high, with high real estate prices. A cubic volume of water can provide over 3,400 times the thermal capacity of an identical cubic volume of air. Even in warm climates, the temperature of coastal seawater and river water is often cooler than air temperature. At locations where winds blow constantly, wind energy generates waves. It is possible for some technologies to convert energy from a choppy water surface to electrical energy. At other locations next to rivers, there may be scope to install a waterwheel or a turbine to convert the kinetic energy of flowing water to electrical power. While such locations are no longer available in large cities, some suitable sites might still be available in rural and remote locations to operate a data center. Kinetic Turbines During an earlier era, undershoot waterwheels converted river flow kinetic energy to mechanical power to operate sawmills or to drive milling wheels for grinding wheat into flour. In the modern era, kinetic turbines have replaced the classical waterwheel. While some kinetic turbines are placed on a river floor or seabed, stationery floating structures restrained by cables are able to carry kinetic turbines under the hull. A kinetic turbine tested along the St. Lawrence River southwest of Montreal incurred higher cost for electric power compared to hydroelectric power dams. The river floor installation of the turbine reduced access for maintenance and especially during icy winter months. Floating technology that carried turbines under the hull were tested along the St. Lawrence River, downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam. Counter-rotating pairs of vertical-axis turbines located under the hull, with a flow defector, would place generating technology and main support bearing inside the floating structure, allowing easy access for maintenance and repair. A submerged counter-flow heat exchange unit under the structure would provide cooling during summer weather. During winter, information processing technology would generate enough heat for interior heating. River Requirements Rivers deemed suitable for floating data centers would require the combination of sufficient water flow velocity and sufficient water depth to operate kinetic turbines efficiently. Cables connected to shore or anchored to the river floor would restrain the floating structure either near midstream or near a river bank. A current-driven kinetic ferry would carry employees between river bank and floating data center. An extended floating dock would be an option, as would having the data center floating in the river stream with a telecommunications connection to a land-based office where programming employees work. Suitable Rivers Data centers require a constant and reliable supply of electrical power, from rivers with reliable and steady water flow, with minimal variation in flow velocity and water depth. The East River in New York City is a suitable candidate. While looking like a river and flowing like a river, it is actually an oceanic channel with flow driven by ocean current. Downstream of Niagara Falls, the Niagara River provides steady water depth and steady flow velocity while being close to a large population. At either location, floating docks restrained by cables could provide access between shore and data center. East of Lake Ontario and downstream of the Moses – Saunders power dam, water of sufficient depth and velocity flows through the north and south channels of the Upper St Lawrence River. Further east and southwest of Montreal, a section of the St. Lawrence River could sustain operation of a floating data center. Kinetic ferry vessels driven by water current could carry technical personnel between shore and midstream floating data center, and optic telecommunications cable could connect between the data center and shore-based work stations, reducing the number of workers who travel by ferry between shore and data center. Other Rivers Many rivers across North America and internationally offer sufficient water depth and water flow velocity, with near steady year-round steam flow rate to sustain operation of floating data centers. Many such rivers are navigable and transit ships, as is the case of sections of the St. Lawrence River. Ferries operate along the East River of New York City despite the powerful water current. Operation of floating data centers also requires access to a suitably qualified workforce, which is available in New York City, the Niagara region and even along sections of the St Lawrence River. The combination of suitable river characteristics and availability of a suitably qualified workforce would determine future locations of floating data centers. It is uncertain as how to regulatory authorities would classify a floating data center, as it is essentially a vessel with the equivalent of a propeller extending downward under the hull. Conclusions Advances in information processing technology along with the development of advanced programming have increased the need to expand the capabilities of data centers. Data centers consume massive amounts of electrical energy and have massive cooling requirements. A data center that floats on water where powerful currents flow, likely have access to required cooling capacity along with the ability to convert river flow energy into electrical power to sustain data center operation. Some future data centers would likely float on fast flowing rivers that pass near large or through cities.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25
Report: Japan’s Mitsui OSK Poised to Order Newbuild Tankers in India,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-japan-s-mitsui-osk-poised-to-order-newbuild-tankers-in-india,,03/09/2025 19:58:07,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which is one of the world’s largest shipowners/operators, told the media in India that it is in discussions to begin building ships at the country’s shipyards as it looks to diversify its sources of newbuilds. The move is in keeping with the Indian government’s efforts to expand the shipbuilding industry into the international market. According to the information supplied during a press briefing, MOL has been exploring the options for shipbuilding in Japan for the past three years, but found the yards lacked capacity. Now with government shipbuilding projects nearing completion, the government’s support, and recent partnerships such as the agreement between Cochin Shipyard and HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering to share expertise, MOL is reported to be in talks with the Indian government and Cochin Shipyard. The Indian government has detailed plans to develop three large shipbuilding clusters as it seeks to expand the industry. It has been courting major Western carriers with discussions reported for new projects with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, and CMA CGM. The container carriers have discussed repair projects as a first step toward building new ships in India. “The plan is to start with simpler vessels, like product tankers, for example, MR tankers, and gradually move towards more complicated ships,” said Captain Anand Jayaraman, South Asia Middle East regional Executive Officer of MOL (India), reports the Indian media outlet ETInfra. The executive reportedly told the media that MOL wants to develop sources beyond China, Korea, and Japan, and within the decade hopes to be able to build Ethane carriers in India. MOL is already the fourth-largest shipping company in India. Out of a total fleet of more than 900 ships, the company has 13 registered in India. The media quotes the captain as saying the company’s goal is to grow to become India’s second-largest shipping company.

The Coast Guard is reporting that the individual fell from a platform that collapsed while two other individuals clung to the structure and were rescued. Related work at the Hanwha Shipyard was immediately suspended as investigations began into the incident. Korean media reports that the Coast Guard and the Ministry of Employment and Labor are investigating the incident as a possible violation of the Industrial Safety and Health Act. Lift testing was being performed on the 150,000-ton FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) vessel being built for Petrobras. According to the reports, large bags filled with water we being lifted between approximately 11:30 am and noon local time using a winch aboard the vessel designed for lifting heavy objects. The structure holding the winch collapsed under the weight, leaving it bent and hanging down. Report from Korean TV (Click image for video) The supervisor who was on the platform fell more than 30 feet (10 meters) to the water below. The Coast Guard reports he was recovered at approximately 1330 and was in cardiac arrest. He died at a local hospital. The other two individuals were able to hold on to the remaining structure. They are reported to have suffered less serious injuries. South Korea’s unions have complained about unsafe working conditions at all the shipyards. Last year, there was another fatal accident at the Hanwha Ocean shipyard that also resulted in work being suspended. A month later, there was a fatal accident that killed a subcontractor at HD Hyundai’s Ulsan shipyard. This latest incident comes as the shipyards have been involved in prolonged contract negotiations with the unions. Hanwha Ocean reached what it called a major labor deal with its unions in late July. The unions, however, have been calling for strikes at HD Hyundai’s shipyards as they demand better wages and working conditions, and now are also protesting the planned merger of HHI’s yard in Ulsan with the Hyundai Mipo shipyard.",Maritime Executive,04/09/2025 21:28:25

USCG Exercises Austal Option For Offshore Patrol Cutters,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-exercises-austal-option-for-offshore-patrol-cutters,,05/09/2025 03:28:29,,"Austal Limited announces that the United States Coast Guard has exercised options worth US$314 million (A$480 million) with Austal USA for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program. The contract options approve Austal to order long lead time materials (LLTM) for another three OPCs, Austal USA’s 4th, 5th, and 6th cutters. Funds have also been provided for logistic supply items for two OPCs. The original OPC contract was awarded to Austal USA in June 2022 for detail design and construction of up to 11 OPCs, with a potential value of US$3.3 billion. To date, two of 11 OPCs in the contract have been awarded to Austal USA, as well as LLTM for a third (see ASX announcement 6 August 2025). “These early awards reflect the strong partnership that has quickly developed between the Coast Guard and Austal USA teams, and provide an important sign of intent for OPCs 3-6,” said Austal CEO Paddy Gregg. Work on Austal USA’s first OPC, Pickering (WMSMS 919), is well underway with the keel laying planned for December. Construction began on Icarus (WMSMS 920) in early August. The 110 metre OPCs will support US national security strategy by maintaining the nation’s economic, social, environmental and military security mission areas. The OPC will typically conduct its primary missions beyond 12 nautical miles from shore and will be employed anywhere US national interests require the Coast Guard’s unique blend of authorities and capabilities. OPC will provide the majority of the Coast Guard’s offshore presence conducting a variety of missions including law enforcement, drug and migrant interdiction, and search and rescue. With a range of 10,200 nautical miles at 14 knots and a 60-day endurance period, each OPC will be capable of deploying independently or as part of task groups, serving as a mobile command and control platform for surge operations such as hurricane response, mass migration incidents and other events. The cutters will also support Arctic objectives by helping regulate and protect emerging commerce and energy exploration in Alaska.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Land-Based Tests Underway for Seawing Automated Kite System,https://maritime-executive.com/article/land-based-tests-underway-for-seawing-automated-kite-system,,05/09/2025 03:20:48,,"Japan’s Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (“K” LINE) reports its subsidiary Oceanic wing completed the first phase of land-based testing for the Seawing kite system. The company is continuing to pursue the commercialization of the concept as a more productive means of wind-assisted propulsion. They acknowledged that while there are several wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) that are under development, they said Seawing is differentiated from the other WAPS by its ability to generate a comparatively large amount of thrust, which is achieved using high-altitude wind. Seawing harnesses natural wind power and can be installed on any type of vessel, including existing vessels. The system is automated and deploys the kite on a tether system placed near the bow. There have been previous tests of kite systems conducted in France. A series of validation tests was undertaken in 2023 using a RoRo sailing for Airbus. In the latest tests, completed in June, Oceanicwing verified the tensile strength and performance of the Seawing system using a 300 m2 kite at a land test site. Confirming that the results of these tests were good, “K” Line says phase two of its development commenced in July. In phase two, Oceanicwing plans to increase the size of the kite and verify the tensile strength, reliability, operability, and safety of the Seawing system at the land test site. They continue to work toward testing on a large bulk carrier owned and operated by “K” LINE. The goal is to complete the tests within approximately two years and move toward the practical application of Seawing. They expect that Seawing will reduce fuel consumption by more than 10 percent. The actual energy-saving effects they note depend on ship type, speed, route, and season, and in certain combinations of these factors, fuel consumption may be reduced by significantly more.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Russia: First NSR International Boxship Route to Start as Box Volume Grows,https://maritime-executive.com/article/russia-first-nsr-international-boxship-route-to-start-as-box-volume-grows,,05/09/2025 02:27:53,,"Russian officials are again highlighting the growth of shipping and specifically containership along the Northern Sea Route. In just 10 days, they expect the first containership following an international route to European ports will start an NSR transit, while data shows a slight increase in traffic so far this year along the Arctic shipping route. The Liberian-flagged containership Istanbul Bridge (66,781 dwt / 4,950 TEU) is completing an eastbound transit, and then Rosatom reports says IAA Port News that the vessel will depart September 15 westbound. For the first time, it will follow a route coming from China with intermediary stops at Felixstowe, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, before proceeding to St. Petersburg. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, IAA reports Rosatom executives highlighted that container vessel traffic is growing on the NSR coming from international ships. They report that last year 14 containerships made the transit, twice as many as in 2023, and they projected more than 20 transits this year. All vessels making the NSR transit have to obtain permits from Rosatom. The forecast is consistent with a mid-season analysis of vessel transits on the NSR released by the Center for High North Logistics. They analyzed AIS data and reported that transits during the first half of the season showed a slight increase, reaching 52 as of the end of August versus 45 last year, with 17 completed, 10 nearing completion, and 12 within the NSR area. An additional 13 ships have commenced sailings scheduled to transit the NSR. The data analysis shows a nearly equal split between east and west transits, but tankers are laden traveling east and returning westward most likely in ballast. Tankers continue to make up the largest number of vessels using the NSR (13), plus two LNG tanker voyages, Bulk carriers and containerships are so far tied with 10 voyages for each segment. However, they said only three of the eastbound bulkers were traveling with cargo. They, however, assume that the vast majority of the containerships are carrying cargo. The main cargo flow continues to be from Russia to China. The analysis notes that September and October, and into November, will be an active period for the NSR. They also highlighted that ice has remained present on portions of the route, with residual ice still being observed in the eastern part of the East Siberian Sea. The final data for the NSR is not scheduled to be released till the end of the year. Russia has been highlighting strong growth and progress toward the objective of year-round transits and reaching the goals set by Vladimir Putin, but it is unclear how accurate the data is and how close they are toward achieving ambitious goals for Arctic route shipping.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Report: Korean Steel Giant POSCO is Exploring Acquiring Control of HMM,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-korean-steel-giant-posco-is-exploring-acquiring-control-of-hmm,,05/09/2025 01:34:05,,"Speculation is being renewed over the ownership fate of Korean shipping company HMM, a year and a half after the deal to sell the company collapsed. In an exclusive report, The Korean Economic Daily writes that steel giant POSCO is drawing up detailed plans to buy control of the shipping company. The Korean Economic Daily reports that POSCO, which had previously been speculated as a potential suitor, has changed its strategy and now is interested in re-entering the shipping sector after deciding not to participate in the government auction in 2023 for control of HMM. POSCO was invested in Hanjin but sold the company in 1995. It reports that POSCO is searching for new growth strategies as it is facing a slowdown and the impact of U.S. tariffs on its steel business and batteries. A controlling stake in HMM has been held by two Korean banks, the Korea Development Bank and the Korea Ocean Business Corporation, since the 2016 government-led rescue of Hyundai Merchant Marine. The two government entities collectively hold over 70 percent of stock in HMM, but have been talking of privatizing the shipping company to redeploy taxpayer monies to other investments to grow Korean business. KDB, which owns an approximately 36 percent stake in HMM, is believed to be the leader in the privatization effort. The banks selected Harim as the preferred bidder last time, but the negotiations reportedly broke down in 2024 over a demand that the banks retain a say in the management of the HMM after the privatization. KDB is believed to be exploring starting a new round of bidding. The Korean Economic Daily reports POSCO’s strategy is targeting acquiring the shares from KDB in a private deal. KOBC, which also holds approximately 36 percent, is believed to have decided to continue to hold its position, and the strategy calls for co-managing HMM between POSCO and KOBC. Korean law requires that if the HMM is to be sold, it must be in a public auction. The newspaper reports that HD Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanjin might be bidders if there were a new auction. Harim is also believed to still be interested in the business. The POSCO strategy, however, could avoid a public auction. HMM has reported that it is pursuing a strategy to diversify its business, which is currently larger in container shipping. It attempted to buy SK Shipping to expand its dry bulk shipping. It is now reported to be pursuing individual vessel purchases of bulkers and tankers as well as building new containerships. It is also ordered car carriers, which will be operated under charter to Hyundai-Glovis, and four multi-purpose cargo vessels.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Dominican Navy Commissions 85 Foot Metal Shark Near Coastal Patrol Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dominican-navy-commissions-85-foot-metal-shark-near-coastal-patrol-vessel,,05/09/2025 01:33:55,,"[By: Metal Shark] The Dominican Navy has received its second 85’ x 19.5’ welded aluminum Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV), built by Louisiana, USA-based boat builder Metal Shark. Christened ARCTURUS CG-114 in keeping with the Dominican tradition of naming military vessels after constellations and celestial bodies, the new patrol craft was built at Metal Shark’s Franklin, Louisiana shipyard and officially incorporated into the Dominican Navy during a ceremony at the Port of Sans Soucí on August 31st. The delivery of ARCTURUS CG-114 follows the delivery of the Dominican Navy’s BETELGEUSE CG-102 in 2020. The vessel was acquired by the Dominican Republic under a $54 million U.S. Navy Foreign Military Sales contract awarded to Metal Shark to produce up to thirteen 85-foot Defiant-class patrol craft for U.S. partner nations in support of regional defense initiatives. ARCTURUS CG-114 is the seventh NCPV to be delivered. The NCPV is a monohull vessel utilizing the parent-craft hull form of Damen Shipyards’ 2606 Standardized Patrol vessel, which has been significantly optimized by Metal Shark to suit the requirements of the NCPV mission. The ARCTURUS CG-114 will strengthen maritime surveillance and control of the Dominican Republic’s jurisdictional waters, expanding its response capacity to combat drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal fishing, and transnational organized crime, while also conducting search and rescue operations at sea. Powered by twin 1,600-horsepower Caterpillar C-32 marine diesel engines turning fixed-pitch Michigan Wheel propellers through Twin Disc MGX-6599 transmissions, the NCPV achieves speeds in excess of 25 knots. The vessel has been designed for missions of up to six days at sea, supporting an operating crew of ten. To maximize versatility, the NCPV carries a 5.6-meter Metal Shark-built aluminum RIB, powered by twin 50-horsepower Mercury four-stroke outboards. The RIB may be quickly deployed and recovered via an integrated stern slipway in support of missions. “Metal Shark is honored to deliver the second Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV) to the Dominican Republic,” said Henry Irizarry, Senior Vice President of International Business Development at Metal Shark. “This delivery represents a strategic milestone in strengthening the Dominican Navy’s ability to protect its maritime domain, counter illicit trafficking, and ensure regional security. The NCPV reflects Metal Shark’s enduring partnership and commitment to advancing shared defense and security interests, reinforcing the strong ties between our nations as we work together to safeguard critical coastal and economic resources.” “The NCPV program is a testament to Metal Shark’s ability to consistently produce rugged and reliable offshore military platforms designed to meet a complex set of mission requirements and built to rigorous NAVSEA standards,” said Metal Shark CEO Chris Allard. “With multiple NCPVs now patrolling the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Central America and additional units under construction, Metal Shark is proudly supporting those who serve and protect across the entire region.” Metal Shark specializes in the design and construction of welded aluminum vessels from 16’ to over 200’ for military, law enforcement, and commercial operators. Key customers include US and foreign militaries, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and other clients worldwide. With two fully self- contained production facilities and an unmanned systems development facility in Louisiana, USA; a research, design, and testing facility in Alabama, USA; and a dedicated engineering facility in Croatia, Metal Shark’s 400+ employees produce over 200 vessels per year with a proud and proven track record of high quality, on-time deliveries.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Leidos Develops Autonomous Commando Landing Craft for UK,https://maritime-executive.com/article/leidos-develops-autonomous-commando-landing-craft-for-uk,,05/09/2025 01:32:57,,"Leidos, the IT and defense tech company behind the Sea Hunter drone boat, has come up with an autonomous commando team delivery craft for the Royal Navy - a new and unusual application of naval autonomous technology. The program's goal is to deliver a series of 24 ""medium surface insertion craft"" that can deploy special forces, lightweight vehicles and ""medium combat loads."" Leidos was historically known as a government IT contractor, but its work with the Navy has allowed it to build up expertise in maritime autonomy, and that's a big part of the firm's focus going forward. ""We're not world renowned as an autonomous naval vessel builder. That's because we don't build ships. But everything around it, and everything that enables those commercial shipyards to become government shipyards, we have,"" CEO Thomas Bell told DefenseOne last month. Originally developed for long-distance oceanic navigation for patrol, submarine-tracking and surface warfare missions, Leidos' autonomy technology can be found aboard the ACTUV / Sea Hunter and the crewboat-based Ghost Fleet Overlord prototype series. The private company currently holds an operation and management contract for the Navy's Ghost Fleet vessels, plus a $250 million five-year contract for unmanned ISR system R&D. Leidos announced Thursday that it has now developed an autonomous landing craft for delivering British commando teams to shore, capable of long range and high speeds (above 40 knots). An illustration released with the announcement shows that it will have a stern ramp for disembarking troops; enough space and deadweight for carrying light tactical vehicles; and a sloped tumblehome hull, typically selected for reduced radar signature. The vessel was designed by Leidos Naval Architects (Gibbs & Cox), the Royal Navy, and the UK Commando Force. It will be fitted out for AI and vessel autonomy, making it one of the larger operationally-deployed autonomous vessels in military service (though it is still not a pure unmanned design, like the Saildrone or NOMARS).",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
NAWE Calls for Expansion of Capital Construction Fund in NDAA,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nawe-calls-for-expansion-of-capital-construction-fund-in-ndaa,,05/09/2025 01:08:14,,"[By: National Association of Waterfront Employers] The National Association of Waterfront Employers (NAWE) is calling on Congress to include the bipartisan “Strengthening American Maritime Dominance Act” (H.R. 3842) in the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This critical measure would expand the Capital Construction Fund (CCF) to allow U.S. marine terminal operators (MTOs) to upgrade critical cargo handling equipment—modernizing port infrastructure at no cost to taxpayers. With operations at 16 of the 17 U.S. defense strategic seaports, NAWE member companies are vital to the nation’s strategic sealift. Including this proposal in the NDAA will not only modernize critical port infrastructure but also allow the industry to safely and securely transition away from cargo handling equipment produced in China. “Ports and the marine terminal companies that operate at our ports are the backbone of our supply chain and economy. Expanding the CCF will ensure that private marine terminal operators can reinvest in safer, cleaner, and more efficient equipment—strengthening America’s ports, boosting domestic manufacturing, and enhancing national security,” said NAWE President Carl Bentzel. Under the proposed expansion, private MTOs could defer taxes and reinvest those funds into new or replacement cargo handling equipment. The legislation includes strong Buy America provisions and bans the purchase of equipment manufactured in China using CCF funds, ensuring investments support U.S. jobs, industry, and workforce safety. Modernizing port infrastructure is critical to preventing future supply chain disruptions–like those seen during the COVID-19 crisis—and to ensuring a responsive delivery system that sustains U.S. military operations abroad. Allowing private reinvestment through the CCF will stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and support resilient trade operations without additional taxpayer burden. NAWE recently outlined its support for the legislation in a letter to House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee leaders. That letter can be found here.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15

Currently, two seats are open after the terms of Chairman Louis Sola and Commissioner Carl Bentzel expired on June 30. Laura DiBella, the former Secretary of Commerce for Florida, is nominated for a term expiring June 30, 2028. Robert Harvey, a lawyer currently leading economic development programs in Florida, is nominated for a term expiring June 30, 2029. The administration has not announced its choice for chairman of the FMC to replace Sola. DiBella and Harvey would join current commissioners Rebecca Dye, Daniel Maffei, and Max Vekich. “I am humbled, honored, and grateful for the faith that President Trump has instilled in me with this nomination. The gravity and responsibility of the role is not lost on me, and I look forward to playing an integral part in carrying out his mission in ‘Restoring America's Maritime Dominance’, ’” DiBella told The Maritime Executive. She is currently a Government Relations Advisor at the law firm of Adams & Reese. In addition to having served as Florida’s first female Secretary of Commerce (2023), DiBella has extensive experience in economic development, having served as President of Business Development at FlordiaCommerce, President/CEO at Enterprise Florida, and President of the Florida Opportunity Fund (Florida’s Venture Capital arm). DiBella also holds the distinction of having been appointed as the first-ever, full-time executive director of Florida Harbor Pilots Association. She was at the organization that represents nearly 100 harbor pilots for the state’s 16 deepwater ports from 2019 to 2022. She also served from 2017 to 2019 as the Port Director for the Port of Fernandina, Ocean Highway and Port Authority of Nassau County, Florida.

Ørsted and States File Lawsuits to Stop Trump’s Attack on Offshore Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/oersted-and-states-file-lawsuits-to-stop-trump-s-attack-on-offshore-wind,,04/09/2025 23:27:56,,"The showdown between the Trump administration and the offshore wind industry is heading to U.S. District Court as the administration continues to step up its assault on the industry. Ørsted, developer of Revolution Wind, filed suit Thursday morning, September 4, in the District of Columbia, and shortly thereafter after Connecticut and Rhode Island also filed suit in Rhode Island seeking to vacate the stop work order for the Revolution Wind project, even as it came out that the administration is now targeting Avangrid’s New England offshore wind project. Revolution Wind, which is a partnership between Ørsted and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, had completed 80 percent of its installation when the Department of the Interior issued a stop-work order in late August. Since then, the administration has said in lawsuits it is also planning to act to rescind the permits issued to US Wind for its Maryland offshore project, Massachusetts’ SouthCoast Wind, and, in a court filing on Wednesday, September 3, New England Wind, which is being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. In the DC District Court filing, Ørsted calls the administration’s action “arbitrary and capricious.” It contends the administration’s order was issued without statutory authority and does not follow regulations and procedures. It is asking the court to immediately vacate the stock-work order. It says time and money were invested in the approval process, and now billions of dollars were spent “in reliance on these valid approvals.” The company called the filing a “necessary step,” while saying it was continuing to seek a resolution with the administration. In the spring, Norway’s Equinor had threatened legal action but stopped short when the Trump administration also issued a stop-work order for its Empire Wind project. The order was lifted after about a month, and behind-the-scenes deals with New York State. The Norwegian government had also pressured the administration. Ørsted is partially owned by Denmark, but it is unclear if the country will also intervene on the company’s behalf. The attorneys general of Connecticut and Rhode Island said there was “zero justification” for the administration’s actions. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we’re suing to stop it,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong. The Trump administration has given multiple reasons for stopping the projects, ranging from “national defense concerns” to allegations that the Biden administration rushed the review process. Ørsted, in its suit, notes that the Department of Defense previously cleared Revolution Wind to proceed. Trump has alleged that “windmills” are not economical without federal aid and won approval to stop tax credit programs, and is now withdrawing grants given to ports for infrastructure investments to aid the industry. Attorney General Tong told the press that the Trump administration is waging “all-out war” on wind power. The administration confirmed that saying it was enlisting support from all its agencies for a coordinated effort to stop the programs. A White House spokesperson responded today to questions about the actions against the projects, saying they had received “unfair, preferential treatment” from the Biden administration. BOEM, during the last administration, approved 11 commercial-scale offshore wind projects and had a schedule for additional auctions. The Trump administration put the process under review and froze future auctions and leases. The administration’s review of the wind industry lease process is also being challenged in court. States’ attorneys general filed suit in May to challenge the executive order and end the delays for offshore wind projects. New England Wind also received its approvals in 2024 for a two-phase project located about 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. The project, which was expected to start construction this year, would provide 1870 MW and was expected to be operational by 2029. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday it would act by October 10 to vacate the approval of the project’s Construction and Operations Plan.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Two Ferry Crewmembers Stand Trial for Fatal Collision off Jersey,https://maritime-executive.com/article/two-ferry-crewmembers-stand-trial-for-fatal-collision-off-jersey,,04/09/2025 22:51:29,,"Two crewmembers of the ferry Commodore Goodwill are standing trial for the deaths of three fishermen in connection with the sinking of a fishing vessel off Jersey, UK in late 2022. On the morning of December 8, 2022, the Condor-operated ferry Commodore Goodwill was under way about four nautical miles off the coast of Jersey, making about 19 knots. The vessel was behind schedule and had put on extra turns to catch up; the weather was clear and surface conditions were calm. UK officer Lewis Peter Carr was standing watch, and Ukrainian seafarer Artur Sevash-Zade was on lookout duty. At about 0535, the Commodore Goodwill hit the small fishing vessel L'Ecume II, sinking it instantly. Skipper Michael Michieli and his two deckhands, Philipinne nationals Jervis Baligat and Larry Simyunn, were killed. Prosecutors allege that there were ample advance warnings of an impending collision, and that Carr and Sevash-Zade were negligent in their duties. Both men face three counts of manslaughter for the fatal accident. On the morning of the collision, Sevash-Zade departed the bridge for breakfast without a relief, prosecutors allege - a violation of company rules - and the L'Ecume II was visible on radar while he was in the ship's mess. After he returned, 13 minutes before the casualty, Goodwill altered course to starboard seven degrees, putting the two vessels on a collision course; the master's standing orders were to maintain a minimum one-nautical-mile closest point of approach, but the ordered course would bring them into much closer proximity, the prosecutors alleged. Goodwill took action to avoid collision when in extremis, but it was too late. The helm was left in autopilot until after collision, and the watchstanders did not pull back on the throttle, prosecutors said. ""[This was] not a freak accident, it was purely the consequence of human error and negligence,"" Crown Advocate Matthew Maletroit told the court.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Portuguese Navy Searching Containership After Report of Boarders,https://maritime-executive.com/article/portuguese-navy-searching-containership-after-report-of-boarders,,04/09/2025 21:27:16,,"The Portuguese Navy confirmed earlier media reports that an operation is underway off the coast after a containership requested assistance. The vessel said there were boarders aboard, and unconfirmed media reports said at least two crewmembers had been locked in the engine room. The vessel, Odysseus (39,420 dwt), is managed by Cosmoship of Greece and was underway last night, September 3, from Virgo to Malga. The alert requesting assistance went out around 2300 local time while the vessel was off the Algarve coast near the city of Lagos, Portugal. Built in 2006, the vessel has a capacity for 2,824 TEU. It is registered in Liberia. The Navy reports the containership diverted to a position approximately six nautical miles off the coast, and that a team from the Navy and National Maritime Authority boarded the vessel. The media reports are that both patrol boats and a helicopter were involved in the operation. The Navy reports that the vessel is diverting to the port of Sines for further inspection. The media said that the two crewmembers were released from the engine room and that an initial search did not locate the boarders. Speculation is that it was a drug cartel that boarded the ship. Portugal’s Correio da Manhã tabloid is saying that there were two individuals armed and wearing hoods spotted on the ship. They are thought to have fled before the authorities arrived to assist the vessel.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15
Houthis Attempt to Increase Attacks on Shipping After Israeli Actions,https://maritime-executive.com/article/houthis-attempt-to-increase-attacks-on-shipping-after-israeli-actions,,04/09/2025 20:28:03,,"The Houthi militants have not made new threats against shipping, but there appears to be another increase in activity both against Israel and shipping that it links to Israel. It comes after the Israelis renewed their statements vowing to stop the Houthi aggression after the militants started to use missiles with cluster bombs. UK Maritime Trade Operations issued a new warning of suspicious activity today, September 4, after receiving reports from an unnamed vessel in the Red Sea. The vessel’s master informed the tracking operations that “an unknown projectile” hit the sea at “some distance” from the vessel. The ship and its crew were reported uninjured and proceeding. The incident took place while the ship was approximately 178 nautical miles northwest of Hudaydah, Yemen, in the Red Sea north of the Bab al-Mandeb strait. The warning also states that the master said the vessel had experienced “severe electronic interference” while it was transiting in the region. UKMTO is advising caution during transits. The attack came as Lloyd’s List published new data showing that the number of vessels making the Red Sea transit increased last month. They calculate that transits were at their highest level since January 2024, and they cite increases from LPG tankers and bulkers, as well as the transits by tankers. The container carriers have continued to mostly divert their vessels around Africa. UKMTO numbers today’s incident as the thirtieth of 2025 after well over 100 in 2024. However, there had been a lull after the Houthis took credit for sinking two bulk carriers, Magic Seas and Eternity C, in July. Last week, Israel responded to what it said was the first attack using cluster weapons. After threatening the leadership of the Houthis, Israel attacked, killing one of the group’s senior leaders, the self-declared prime minister of the Houthis, Ahmed al-Rahawi. Associated Press determined, based on photos, that there were a total of 11 coffins in the funeral processional on Monday. The day before, the Liberian-registered chemical tanker Scarlet Ray also reported a missile had splashed near the vessel and exploded. The Houthis claimed they struck the vessel, which is operated by Eastern Pacific, the Idan Ofer company. Eastern Pacific later also reported the vessel had not sustained damage. The Houthis also made a claim on Tuesday, September 2, to have struck the MSC Aby (110,387 dwt / 9648 TEU). The unconfirmed report, which was dismissed by security consultants as likely false, said they had launched two drones and a missile that struck the containership in the Northern Red Sea. The ship, according to MSC’s published schedule, was due in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Analysts have raised concern, however, that the Houthis have extended the reach of their attacks further north into the Red Sea, threatening the region near Saudi Arabia. Last year’s attacks were mostly in the southern Red Sea near the strait or in the Gulf of Aden. While there have been reports of attacks on shipping in recent days, the group is focused mostly on Israel. Today, September 4, they claimed another missile launch, which reports say the Israelis intercepted. Analysts note, however, that the launches directed at Israel are coming at an increased frequency, either daily or multiple times in a day. The Israelis have again made public statements that they will increase their response to stop the launches.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 04:37:15

Though the two enterprises have both been under CSSC's control since 2019, they retained their independent stock listings - until Thursday, when an exchange filing completed the integration of CSIC into CSSC. At the market close on Thursday, CSIC shareholders received 0.13 shares of CSSC for every share they owned. CSIC's stock will be delisted from the Shanghai Exchange on Friday. After that point, it will be dissolved as a legal entity, and all of its assets and obligations will be assumed by CSSC. The company's hope is that it will be able to better integrate its shipyard assembly operations, improve its purchasing power, achieve as-yet-unrealized synergies from the union of the two companies, and ""regulate competition within the same industry.""d As a group, CSSC and CSIC were already the world's largest shipbuilding conglomerate. Now with a unified brand, the merger confirms CSSC as the biggest shipbuilder by assets, revenue and order backlog. In 2024, CSSC-operated yards built more tonnage than the entire production of the U.S. shipbuilding industry since 1945. The merger is a reunion, and it brings CSSC back full circle to its former might. The giant state enterprise spun off CSIC as a separate entity in 1999, and gave it control of government yards in northern China. CSIC came back under CSSC's ownership in 2019, but it retained its brand, management structure and support departments. In September 2024, CSSC announced long-expected plans to re-merge the two firms fully into a single entity. The full integration will have implications for Chinese defense procurement. CSIC handles a large share of the PLA Navy's surface fleet construction contracts, and unification with CSSC is expected to help streamline warship production.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Hanwha Sells $1B Worth of Stock in Hanwha Ocean to Fund U.S. Projects,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hanwha-sells-1b-worth-of-stock-in-hanwha-ocean-to-fund-u-s-projects,,05/09/2025 04:21:45,,"A holding company in South Korea's Hanwha Group has sold about $1 billion worth of shares in shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, and it plans to reinvest the proceeds in its new U.S. projects. Hanwha Impact Partners has sold its entire remaining stake in Hanwha Ocean - about 13 million shares, equal to about four percent of the company - to institutional buyers in a block sale. The holding company started out with a nine percent stake in 2023, the year Hanwha bought the shipbuilder, according to Yonhap. Hanwha Group retains 42 percent of Hanwha Ocean, along with management rights. The share sale is well-timed: Hanwha Ocean's stock has risen by 250 percent since last year. Hanwha Ocean share prices fell by five percent after the announcement Thursday. Hanwha owns Hanwha Philly Shipyard, formerly held by Norwegian conglomerate Aker, and it has pledged to spend $5 billion on enlarging the American yard's capacity, taking it from one ship delivery per year today to 20 ships per year by the 2030s. Philly's yard - valued at $100 million at the time of its sale last year - will be upgraded with improved basic infrastructure, as well as South Korean innovations like robotic welding technology. This is one of the first major commitments under the $150 billion program that South Korea's government calls ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. Hanwha is also buying two LNG carriers that will be built jointly in Korea and the U.S., then flagged into the United States registry. The project will be an opportunity to transfer Korean LNG shipbuilding techniques and technology to Philly, Hanwha says. In addition, it has ordered a series of 10 MR chemical tankers from Philly, which it says is the biggest commercial order by value ever placed at an American yard. Hanwha Group said that the share sale will help fund these initiatives, and a company official also told Yonhap that ""the goal is also to improve the financial structure by repaying debt.""",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
"China Unveils Large Shipboard Laser System for ""Maritime Attack""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/china-unveils-large-shipboard-laser-system-for-maritime-attack,,05/09/2025 04:12:41,,"China's military has unveiled a previously-unseen laser weapons system at its massive parade in Beijing. The new LY-1 laser is designed for shipboard applications, but for the reveal, it was fielded in a truck-mounted mobile version. The LY-1 is the latest in a series of laser weapons that China's PLA Navy has been developing since the late 2010s. Laser weapons have advantages, particularly against high-volume threats like drone aircraft and drone boats, but they also pose significant technical challenges: they must be able to track on target long enough to heat up and burn a hole in an incoming drone or missile, and the length of time required goes up if the power delivered goes down. Atmospheric conditions like fog and smoke can interfere with a laser beam, reducing impact on the target. The LY-1's power and range were not disclosed, but the announcer for the parade described the device as ""strongly capable of precision disruption and persistent strike."" In the West, shipboard laser weapons are discussed in the context of point defense against drones and missiles; by contrast, the official description advertised the LY-1 as a device capable of ""maritime attack"" applications, indicating an offensive capability is contemplated. Global Times, a state media outlet, said that the LY-1 can also be used for damaging optical sensors - a low-end application for a shipboard laser. ""On ships, the LY-1 has sufficient space for power units, meaning that it could have higher power, enabling it to be capable of intercepting not only attacks from unmanned equipment, but also anti-ship missiles, with very low cost for each interception,"" Global Times wrote. Zhao Dashuai, a social media commentator for the People's Armed Police Propaganda Bureau, connected LY-1's development to U.S. Navy weapons systems. ""Capable of shooting down missiles, this makes subsonic antiship missiles obsolete,"" Zhao wrote. ""Looking at you LRASM, Harpoon and NSM [Lockheed's Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, Boeing's Harpoon and Kongsberg's Naval Strike Missile]."" At the parade, the PLA also displayed the Hurricane 3000, a massive microwave array for disabling drones' electronics mid-flight. Not just a jammer, the array is powerful enough to cause internal damage to electronic circuits, like putting a smartphone in a microwave oven. China North Industries Group Corporation claims that it has a range of three kilometers, and it is truck-mounted for road-mobile deployment (or mounting on an open weather deck). The U.S. Army has a comparable system with a more compact form factor and somewhat less range, the Leonidas Generation II.

The contract options approve Austal to order long lead time materials (LLTM) for another three OPCs, Austal USA’s 4th, 5th, and 6th cutters. Funds have also been provided for logistic supply items for two OPCs. The original OPC contract was awarded to Austal USA in June 2022 for detail design and construction of up to 11 OPCs, with a potential value of US$3.3 billion. To date, two of 11 OPCs in the contract have been awarded to Austal USA, as well as LLTM for a third (see ASX announcement 6 August 2025). “These early awards reflect the strong partnership that has quickly developed between the Coast Guard and Austal USA teams, and provide an important sign of intent for OPCs 3-6,” said Austal CEO Paddy Gregg. Work on Austal USA’s first OPC, Pickering (WMSMS 919), is well underway with the keel laying planned for December. Construction began on Icarus (WMSMS 920) in early August. The 110 metre OPCs will support US national security strategy by maintaining the nation’s economic, social, environmental and military security mission areas. The OPC will typically conduct its primary missions beyond 12 nautical miles from shore and will be employed anywhere US national interests require the Coast Guard’s unique blend of authorities and capabilities. OPC will provide the majority of the Coast Guard’s offshore presence conducting a variety of missions including law enforcement, drug and migrant interdiction, and search and rescue. With a range of 10,200 nautical miles at 14 knots and a 60-day endurance period, each OPC will be capable of deploying independently or as part of task groups, serving as a mobile command and control platform for surge operations such as hurricane response, mass migration incidents and other events. The cutters will also support Arctic objectives by helping regulate and protect emerging commerce and energy exploration in Alaska.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Land-Based Tests Underway for Seawing Automated Kite System,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/land-based-tests-underway-for-seawing-automated-kite-system,,05/09/2025 03:20:48,,"Japan’s Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (“K” LINE) reports its subsidiary Oceanic wing completed the first phase of land-based testing for the Seawing kite system. The company is continuing to pursue the commercialization of the concept as a more productive means of wind-assisted propulsion. They acknowledged that while there are several wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) that are under development, they said Seawing is differentiated from the other WAPS by its ability to generate a comparatively large amount of thrust, which is achieved using high-altitude wind. Seawing harnesses natural wind power and can be installed on any type of vessel, including existing vessels. The system is automated and deploys the kite on a tether system placed near the bow. There have been previous tests of kite systems conducted in France. A series of validation tests was undertaken in 2023 using a RoRo sailing for Airbus. In the latest tests, completed in June, Oceanicwing verified the tensile strength and performance of the Seawing system using a 300 m2 kite at a land test site. Confirming that the results of these tests were good, “K” Line says phase two of its development commenced in July. In phase two, Oceanicwing plans to increase the size of the kite and verify the tensile strength, reliability, operability, and safety of the Seawing system at the land test site. They continue to work toward testing on a large bulk carrier owned and operated by “K” LINE. The goal is to complete the tests within approximately two years and move toward the practical application of Seawing. They expect that Seawing will reduce fuel consumption by more than 10 percent. The actual energy-saving effects they note depend on ship type, speed, route, and season, and in certain combinations of these factors, fuel consumption may be reduced by significantly more.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Russia: First NSR International Boxship Route to Start as Box Volume Grows,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russia-first-nsr-international-boxship-route-to-start-as-box-volume-grows,,05/09/2025 02:27:53,,"Russian officials are again highlighting the growth of shipping and specifically containership along the Northern Sea Route. In just 10 days, they expect the first containership following an international route to European ports will start an NSR transit, while data shows a slight increase in traffic so far this year along the Arctic shipping route. The Liberian-flagged containership Istanbul Bridge (66,781 dwt / 4,950 TEU) is completing an eastbound transit, and then Rosatom reports says IAA Port News that the vessel will depart September 15 westbound. For the first time, it will follow a route coming from China with intermediary stops at Felixstowe, Rotterdam, and Hamburg, before proceeding to St. Petersburg. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum, IAA reports Rosatom executives highlighted that container vessel traffic is growing on the NSR coming from international ships. They report that last year 14 containerships made the transit, twice as many as in 2023, and they projected more than 20 transits this year. All vessels making the NSR transit have to obtain permits from Rosatom. The forecast is consistent with a mid-season analysis of vessel transits on the NSR released by the Center for High North Logistics. They analyzed AIS data and reported that transits during the first half of the season showed a slight increase, reaching 52 as of the end of August versus 45 last year, with 17 completed, 10 nearing completion, and 12 within the NSR area. An additional 13 ships have commenced sailings scheduled to transit the NSR. The data analysis shows a nearly equal split between east and west transits, but tankers are laden traveling east and returning westward most likely in ballast. Tankers continue to make up the largest number of vessels using the NSR (13), plus two LNG tanker voyages, Bulk carriers and containerships are so far tied with 10 voyages for each segment. However, they said only three of the eastbound bulkers were traveling with cargo. They, however, assume that the vast majority of the containerships are carrying cargo. The main cargo flow continues to be from Russia to China. The analysis notes that September and October, and into November, will be an active period for the NSR. They also highlighted that ice has remained present on portions of the route, with residual ice still being observed in the eastern part of the East Siberian Sea. The final data for the NSR is not scheduled to be released till the end of the year. Russia has been highlighting strong growth and progress toward the objective of year-round transits and reaching the goals set by Vladimir Putin, but it is unclear how accurate the data is and how close they are toward achieving ambitious goals for Arctic route shipping.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Report: Korean Steel Giant POSCO is Exploring Acquiring Control of HMM,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-korean-steel-giant-posco-is-exploring-acquiring-control-of-hmm,,05/09/2025 01:34:05,,"Speculation is being renewed over the ownership fate of Korean shipping company HMM, a year and a half after the deal to sell the company collapsed. In an exclusive report, The Korean Economic Daily writes that steel giant POSCO is drawing up detailed plans to buy control of the shipping company. The Korean Economic Daily reports that POSCO, which had previously been speculated as a potential suitor, has changed its strategy and now is interested in re-entering the shipping sector after deciding not to participate in the government auction in 2023 for control of HMM. POSCO was invested in Hanjin but sold the company in 1995. It reports that POSCO is searching for new growth strategies as it is facing a slowdown and the impact of U.S. tariffs on its steel business and batteries. A controlling stake in HMM has been held by two Korean banks, the Korea Development Bank and the Korea Ocean Business Corporation, since the 2016 government-led rescue of Hyundai Merchant Marine. The two government entities collectively hold over 70 percent of stock in HMM, but have been talking of privatizing the shipping company to redeploy taxpayer monies to other investments to grow Korean business. KDB, which owns an approximately 36 percent stake in HMM, is believed to be the leader in the privatization effort. The banks selected Harim as the preferred bidder last time, but the negotiations reportedly broke down in 2024 over a demand that the banks retain a say in the management of the HMM after the privatization. KDB is believed to be exploring starting a new round of bidding. The Korean Economic Daily reports POSCO’s strategy is targeting acquiring the shares from KDB in a private deal. KOBC, which also holds approximately 36 percent, is believed to have decided to continue to hold its position, and the strategy calls for co-managing HMM between POSCO and KOBC. Korean law requires that if the HMM is to be sold, it must be in a public auction. The newspaper reports that HD Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanjin might be bidders if there were a new auction. Harim is also believed to still be interested in the business. The POSCO strategy, however, could avoid a public auction. HMM has reported that it is pursuing a strategy to diversify its business, which is currently larger in container shipping. It attempted to buy SK Shipping to expand its dry bulk shipping. It is now reported to be pursuing individual vessel purchases of bulkers and tankers as well as building new containerships. It is also ordered car carriers, which will be operated under charter to Hyundai-Glovis, and four multi-purpose cargo vessels.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Dominican Navy Commissions 85 Foot Metal Shark Near Coastal Patrol Vessel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dominican-navy-commissions-85-foot-metal-shark-near-coastal-patrol-vessel,,05/09/2025 01:33:55,,"[By: Metal Shark] The Dominican Navy has received its second 85’ x 19.5’ welded aluminum Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV), built by Louisiana, USA-based boat builder Metal Shark. Christened ARCTURUS CG-114 in keeping with the Dominican tradition of naming military vessels after constellations and celestial bodies, the new patrol craft was built at Metal Shark’s Franklin, Louisiana shipyard and officially incorporated into the Dominican Navy during a ceremony at the Port of Sans Soucí on August 31st. The delivery of ARCTURUS CG-114 follows the delivery of the Dominican Navy’s BETELGEUSE CG-102 in 2020. The vessel was acquired by the Dominican Republic under a $54 million U.S. Navy Foreign Military Sales contract awarded to Metal Shark to produce up to thirteen 85-foot Defiant-class patrol craft for U.S. partner nations in support of regional defense initiatives. ARCTURUS CG-114 is the seventh NCPV to be delivered. The NCPV is a monohull vessel utilizing the parent-craft hull form of Damen Shipyards’ 2606 Standardized Patrol vessel, which has been significantly optimized by Metal Shark to suit the requirements of the NCPV mission. The ARCTURUS CG-114 will strengthen maritime surveillance and control of the Dominican Republic’s jurisdictional waters, expanding its response capacity to combat drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal fishing, and transnational organized crime, while also conducting search and rescue operations at sea. Powered by twin 1,600-horsepower Caterpillar C-32 marine diesel engines turning fixed-pitch Michigan Wheel propellers through Twin Disc MGX-6599 transmissions, the NCPV achieves speeds in excess of 25 knots. The vessel has been designed for missions of up to six days at sea, supporting an operating crew of ten. To maximize versatility, the NCPV carries a 5.6-meter Metal Shark-built aluminum RIB, powered by twin 50-horsepower Mercury four-stroke outboards. The RIB may be quickly deployed and recovered via an integrated stern slipway in support of missions. “Metal Shark is honored to deliver the second Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV) to the Dominican Republic,” said Henry Irizarry, Senior Vice President of International Business Development at Metal Shark. “This delivery represents a strategic milestone in strengthening the Dominican Navy’s ability to protect its maritime domain, counter illicit trafficking, and ensure regional security. The NCPV reflects Metal Shark’s enduring partnership and commitment to advancing shared defense and security interests, reinforcing the strong ties between our nations as we work together to safeguard critical coastal and economic resources.” “The NCPV program is a testament to Metal Shark’s ability to consistently produce rugged and reliable offshore military platforms designed to meet a complex set of mission requirements and built to rigorous NAVSEA standards,” said Metal Shark CEO Chris Allard. “With multiple NCPVs now patrolling the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Central America and additional units under construction, Metal Shark is proudly supporting those who serve and protect across the entire region.” Metal Shark specializes in the design and construction of welded aluminum vessels from 16’ to over 200’ for military, law enforcement, and commercial operators. Key customers include US and foreign militaries, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and other clients worldwide. With two fully self- contained production facilities and an unmanned systems development facility in Louisiana, USA; a research, design, and testing facility in Alabama, USA; and a dedicated engineering facility in Croatia, Metal Shark’s 400+ employees produce over 200 vessels per year with a proud and proven track record of high quality, on-time deliveries.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
Leidos Develops Autonomous Commando Landing Craft for UK,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/leidos-develops-autonomous-commando-landing-craft-for-uk,,05/09/2025 01:32:57,,"Leidos, the IT and defense tech company behind the Sea Hunter drone boat, has come up with an autonomous commando team delivery craft for the Royal Navy - a new and unusual application of naval autonomous technology. The program's goal is to deliver a series of 24 ""medium surface insertion craft"" that can deploy special forces, lightweight vehicles and ""medium combat loads."" Leidos was historically known as a government IT contractor, but its work with the Navy has allowed it to build up expertise in maritime autonomy, and that's a big part of the firm's focus going forward. ""We're not world renowned as an autonomous naval vessel builder. That's because we don't build ships. But everything around it, and everything that enables those commercial shipyards to become government shipyards, we have,"" CEO Thomas Bell told DefenseOne last month. Originally developed for long-distance oceanic navigation for patrol, submarine-tracking and surface warfare missions, Leidos' autonomy technology can be found aboard the ACTUV / Sea Hunter and the crewboat-based Ghost Fleet Overlord prototype series. The private company currently holds an operation and management contract for the Navy's Ghost Fleet vessels, plus a $250 million five-year contract for unmanned ISR system R&D. Leidos announced Thursday that it has now developed an autonomous landing craft for delivering British commando teams to shore, capable of long range and high speeds (above 40 knots). An illustration released with the announcement shows that it will have a stern ramp for disembarking troops; enough space and deadweight for carrying light tactical vehicles; and a sloped tumblehome hull, typically selected for reduced radar signature. The vessel was designed by Leidos Naval Architects (Gibbs & Cox), the Royal Navy, and the UK Commando Force. It will be fitted out for AI and vessel autonomy, making it one of the larger operationally-deployed autonomous vessels in military service (though it is still not a pure unmanned design, like the Saildrone or NOMARS).",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22
NAWE Calls for Expansion of Capital Construction Fund in NDAA,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nawe-calls-for-expansion-of-capital-construction-fund-in-ndaa,,05/09/2025 01:08:14,,"[By: National Association of Waterfront Employers] The National Association of Waterfront Employers (NAWE) is calling on Congress to include the bipartisan “Strengthening American Maritime Dominance Act” (H.R. 3842) in the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This critical measure would expand the Capital Construction Fund (CCF) to allow U.S. marine terminal operators (MTOs) to upgrade critical cargo handling equipment—modernizing port infrastructure at no cost to taxpayers. With operations at 16 of the 17 U.S. defense strategic seaports, NAWE member companies are vital to the nation’s strategic sealift. Including this proposal in the NDAA will not only modernize critical port infrastructure but also allow the industry to safely and securely transition away from cargo handling equipment produced in China. “Ports and the marine terminal companies that operate at our ports are the backbone of our supply chain and economy. Expanding the CCF will ensure that private marine terminal operators can reinvest in safer, cleaner, and more efficient equipment—strengthening America’s ports, boosting domestic manufacturing, and enhancing national security,” said NAWE President Carl Bentzel. Under the proposed expansion, private MTOs could defer taxes and reinvest those funds into new or replacement cargo handling equipment. The legislation includes strong Buy America provisions and bans the purchase of equipment manufactured in China using CCF funds, ensuring investments support U.S. jobs, industry, and workforce safety. Modernizing port infrastructure is critical to preventing future supply chain disruptions–like those seen during the COVID-19 crisis—and to ensuring a responsive delivery system that sustains U.S. military operations abroad. Allowing private reinvestment through the CCF will stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and support resilient trade operations without additional taxpayer burden. NAWE recently outlined its support for the legislation in a letter to House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee leaders. That letter can be found here.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22

Currently, two seats are open after the terms of Chairman Louis Sola and Commissioner Carl Bentzel expired on June 30. Laura DiBella, the former Secretary of Commerce for Florida, is nominated for a term expiring June 30, 2028. Robert Harvey, a lawyer currently leading economic development programs in Florida, is nominated for a term expiring June 30, 2029. The administration has not announced its choice for chairman of the FMC to replace Sola. DiBella and Harvey would join current commissioners Rebecca Dye, Daniel Maffei, and Max Vekich. “I am humbled, honored, and grateful for the faith that President Trump has instilled in me with this nomination. The gravity and responsibility of the role is not lost on me, and I look forward to playing an integral part in carrying out his mission in ‘Restoring America's Maritime Dominance’, ’” DiBella told The Maritime Executive. She is currently a Government Relations Advisor at the law firm of Adams & Reese. In addition to having served as Florida’s first female Secretary of Commerce (2023), DiBella has extensive experience in economic development, having served as President of Business Development at FlordiaCommerce, President/CEO at Enterprise Florida, and President of the Florida Opportunity Fund (Florida’s Venture Capital arm). DiBella also holds the distinction of having been appointed as the first-ever, full-time executive director of Florida Harbor Pilots Association. She was at the organization that represents nearly 100 harbor pilots for the state’s 16 deepwater ports from 2019 to 2022. She also served from 2017 to 2019 as the Port Director for the Port of Fernandina, Ocean Highway and Port Authority of Nassau County, Florida.

Ørsted and States File Lawsuits to Stop Trump’s Attack on Offshore Wind,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/oersted-and-states-file-lawsuits-to-stop-trump-s-attack-on-offshore-wind,,04/09/2025 23:27:56,,"The showdown between the Trump administration and the offshore wind industry is heading to U.S. District Court as the administration continues to step up its assault on the industry. Ørsted, developer of Revolution Wind, filed suit Thursday morning, September 4, in the District of Columbia, and shortly thereafter after Connecticut and Rhode Island also filed suit in Rhode Island seeking to vacate the stop work order for the Revolution Wind project, even as it came out that the administration is now targeting Avangrid’s New England offshore wind project. Revolution Wind, which is a partnership between Ørsted and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, had completed 80 percent of its installation when the Department of the Interior issued a stop-work order in late August. Since then, the administration has said in lawsuits it is also planning to act to rescind the permits issued to US Wind for its Maryland offshore project, Massachusetts’ SouthCoast Wind, and, in a court filing on Wednesday, September 3, New England Wind, which is being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. In the DC District Court filing, Ørsted calls the administration’s action “arbitrary and capricious.” It contends the administration’s order was issued without statutory authority and does not follow regulations and procedures. It is asking the court to immediately vacate the stock-work order. It says time and money were invested in the approval process, and now billions of dollars were spent “in reliance on these valid approvals.” The company called the filing a “necessary step,” while saying it was continuing to seek a resolution with the administration. In the spring, Norway’s Equinor had threatened legal action but stopped short when the Trump administration also issued a stop-work order for its Empire Wind project. The order was lifted after about a month, and behind-the-scenes deals with New York State. The Norwegian government had also pressured the administration. Ørsted is partially owned by Denmark, but it is unclear if the country will also intervene on the company’s behalf. The attorneys general of Connecticut and Rhode Island said there was “zero justification” for the administration’s actions. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal, and we’re suing to stop it,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong. The Trump administration has given multiple reasons for stopping the projects, ranging from “national defense concerns” to allegations that the Biden administration rushed the review process. Ørsted, in its suit, notes that the Department of Defense previously cleared Revolution Wind to proceed. Trump has alleged that “windmills” are not economical without federal aid and won approval to stop tax credit programs, and is now withdrawing grants given to ports for infrastructure investments to aid the industry. Attorney General Tong told the press that the Trump administration is waging “all-out war” on wind power. The administration confirmed that saying it was enlisting support from all its agencies for a coordinated effort to stop the programs. A White House spokesperson responded today to questions about the actions against the projects, saying they had received “unfair, preferential treatment” from the Biden administration. BOEM, during the last administration, approved 11 commercial-scale offshore wind projects and had a schedule for additional auctions. The Trump administration put the process under review and froze future auctions and leases. The administration’s review of the wind industry lease process is also being challenged in court. States’ attorneys general filed suit in May to challenge the executive order and end the delays for offshore wind projects. New England Wind also received its approvals in 2024 for a two-phase project located about 30 miles off the coast of Massachusetts. The project, which was expected to start construction this year, would provide 1870 MW and was expected to be operational by 2029. The Department of Justice said on Wednesday it would act by October 10 to vacate the approval of the project’s Construction and Operations Plan.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 09:30:22

On the morning of December 8, 2022, the Condor-operated ferry Commodore Goodwill was under way about four nautical miles off the coast of Jersey, making about 19 knots. The vessel was behind schedule and had put on extra turns to catch up; the weather was clear and surface conditions were calm. UK officer Lewis Peter Carr was standing watch, and Ukrainian seafarer Artur Sevash-Zade was on lookout duty. At about 0535, the Commodore Goodwill hit the small fishing vessel L'Ecume II, sinking it instantly. Skipper Michael Michieli and his two deckhands, Philipinne nationals Jervis Baligat and Larry Simyunn, were killed. Prosecutors allege that there were ample advance warnings of an impending collision, and that Carr and Sevash-Zade were negligent in their duties. Both men face three counts of manslaughter for the fatal accident. On the morning of the collision, Sevash-Zade departed the bridge for breakfast without a relief, prosecutors allege - a violation of company rules - and the L'Ecume II was visible on radar while he was in the ship's mess. After he returned, 13 minutes before the casualty, Goodwill altered course to starboard seven degrees, putting the two vessels on a collision course; the master's standing orders were to maintain a minimum one-nautical-mile closest point of approach, but the ordered course would bring them into much closer proximity, the prosecutors alleged. Goodwill took action to avoid collision when in extremis, but it was too late. The helm was left in autopilot until after collision, and the watchstanders did not pull back on the throttle, prosecutors said.

"After Six Years, CSSC Completes its Megamerger With CSIC",https://maritime-executive.com/article/after-six-years-cssc-completes-its-megamerger-with-csic,,05/09/2025 06:10:05,,"After years of preparation, the megamerger of Chinese shipbuilding giants CSSC and CSIC has finally been completed. Though the two enterprises have both been under CSSC's control since 2019, they retained their independent stock listings - until Thursday, when an exchange filing completed the integration of CSIC into CSSC. At the market close on Thursday, CSIC shareholders received 0.13 shares of CSSC for every share they owned. CSIC's stock will be delisted from the Shanghai Exchange on Friday. After that point, it will be dissolved as a legal entity, and all of its assets and obligations will be assumed by CSSC. The company's hope is that it will be able to better integrate its shipyard assembly operations, improve its purchasing power, achieve as-yet-unrealized synergies from the union of the two companies, and ""regulate competition within the same industry.""d As a group, CSSC and CSIC were already the world's largest shipbuilding conglomerate. Now with a unified brand, the merger confirms CSSC as the biggest shipbuilder by assets, revenue and order backlog. In 2024, CSSC-operated yards built more tonnage than the entire production of the U.S. shipbuilding industry since 1945. The merger is a reunion, and it brings CSSC back full circle to its former might. The giant state enterprise spun off CSIC as a separate entity in 1999, and gave it control of government yards in northern China. CSIC came back under CSSC's ownership in 2019, but it retained its brand, management structure and support departments. In September 2024, CSSC announced long-expected plans to re-merge the two firms fully into a single entity. The full integration will have implications for Chinese defense procurement. CSIC handles a large share of the PLA Navy's surface fleet construction contracts, and unification with CSSC is expected to help streamline warship production.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 15:40:24
Hanwha Sells $1B Worth of Stock in Hanwha Ocean to Fund U.S. Projects,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hanwha-sells-1b-worth-of-stock-in-hanwha-ocean-to-fund-u-s-projects,,05/09/2025 04:21:45,,"A holding company in South Korea's Hanwha Group has sold about $1 billion worth of shares in shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, and it plans to reinvest the proceeds in its new U.S. projects. Hanwha Impact Partners has sold its entire remaining stake in Hanwha Ocean - about 13 million shares, equal to about four percent of the company - to institutional buyers in a block sale. The holding company started out with a nine percent stake in 2023, the year Hanwha bought the shipbuilder, according to Yonhap. Hanwha Group retains 42 percent of Hanwha Ocean, along with management rights. The share sale is well-timed: Hanwha Ocean's stock has risen by 250 percent since last year. Hanwha Ocean share prices fell by five percent after the announcement Thursday. Hanwha owns Hanwha Philly Shipyard, formerly held by Norwegian conglomerate Aker, and it has pledged to spend $5 billion on enlarging the American yard's capacity, taking it from one ship delivery per year today to 20 ships per year by the 2030s. Philly's yard - valued at $100 million at the time of its sale last year - will be upgraded with improved basic infrastructure, as well as South Korean innovations like robotic welding technology. This is one of the first major commitments under the $150 billion program that South Korea's government calls ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. Hanwha is also buying two LNG carriers that will be built jointly in Korea and the U.S., then flagged into the United States registry. The project will be an opportunity to transfer Korean LNG shipbuilding techniques and technology to Philly, Hanwha says. In addition, it has ordered a series of 10 MR chemical tankers from Philly, which it says is the biggest commercial order by value ever placed at an American yard. Hanwha Group said that the share sale will help fund these initiatives, and a company official also told Yonhap that ""the goal is also to improve the financial structure by repaying debt.""",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 15:40:24
"China Unveils Large Shipboard Laser System for ""Maritime Attack""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-unveils-large-shipboard-laser-system-for-maritime-attack,,05/09/2025 04:12:41,,"China's military has unveiled a previously-unseen laser weapons system at its massive parade in Beijing. The new LY-1 laser is designed for shipboard applications, but for the reveal, it was fielded in a truck-mounted mobile version. The LY-1 is the latest in a series of laser weapons that China's PLA Navy has been developing since the late 2010s. Laser weapons have advantages, particularly against high-volume threats like drone aircraft and drone boats, but they also pose significant technical challenges: they must be able to track on target long enough to heat up and burn a hole in an incoming drone or missile, and the length of time required goes up if the power delivered goes down. Atmospheric conditions like fog and smoke can interfere with a laser beam, reducing impact on the target. The LY-1's power and range were not disclosed, but the announcer for the parade described the device as ""strongly capable of precision disruption and persistent strike."" In the West, shipboard laser weapons are discussed in the context of point defense against drones and missiles; by contrast, the official description advertised the LY-1 as a device capable of ""maritime attack"" applications, indicating an offensive capability is contemplated. Global Times, a state media outlet, said that the LY-1 can also be used for damaging optical sensors - a low-end application for a shipboard laser. ""On ships, the LY-1 has sufficient space for power units, meaning that it could have higher power, enabling it to be capable of intercepting not only attacks from unmanned equipment, but also anti-ship missiles, with very low cost for each interception,"" Global Times wrote. Zhao Dashuai, a social media commentator for the People's Armed Police Propaganda Bureau, connected LY-1's development to U.S. Navy weapons systems. ""Capable of shooting down missiles, this makes subsonic antiship missiles obsolete,"" Zhao wrote. ""Looking at you LRASM, Harpoon and NSM [Lockheed's Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, Boeing's Harpoon and Kongsberg's Naval Strike Missile]."" At the parade, the PLA also displayed the Hurricane 3000, a massive microwave array for disabling drones' electronics mid-flight. Not just a jammer, the array is powerful enough to cause internal damage to electronic circuits, like putting a smartphone in a microwave oven. China North Industries Group Corporation claims that it has a range of three kilometers, and it is truck-mounted for road-mobile deployment (or mounting on an open weather deck). The U.S. Army has a comparable system with a more compact form factor and somewhat less range, the Leonidas Generation II. The U.S. Navy tested an earlier version of this system against small craft targets, and found it effective in disabling electronically-controlled motors - a useful technology for defeating swarms of unmanned drone boats.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 15:40:24

Virgin Voyages Hits its Stride as Fourth Ship Enters Service,https://maritime-executive.com/article/virgin-voyages-hits-its-stride-as-fourth-ship-enters-service,,05/09/2025 19:36:59,,"Virgin Voyages is marking a key milestone as its fourth cruise ship, Brilliant Lady, embarks its first revenue passengers on Friday, September 5, for the so-titled “MerMaiden Cruise” aboard the lady ship. The company admits it took time to find its voice and refine its message, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but now it believes it is in a strong position with rapidly growing bookings and a strong base of loyal cruisers anxious for more product. Planning for a cruise line to build on Sir Richard Branson’s unique style and framed Virgin Group started nearly 15 years ago, with the group pulling the trigger on what turned into a nearly €3 billion investment, ordering three 110,000 gross ton cruise ships from Fincantieri in 2016 and a fourth in 2018. The launch was timed for what turned out to be the first weeks of the global pandemic in 2020 and forced the delayed entry of each of the ships into service. Virgin Voyages took the unusual strategy of holding the ships for up to 18 months in warm layup before starting revenue operations. The company remained focused on the launch, executing it well, and keeping the standards for the product high. Nirmal Saverimuttu, who led the exploration and development of the cruise plan for Virgin Group and became Chief Executive Officer in September 2023, says they remained focused on key elements of the onboard experience, which, for him, include the food concepts, the crew, and the elevated experiences onboard. Nirmal Saverimuttu highlights the crew and the experiences on board as what makes the ships unique (Virgin Voyages) The pillars of the brand were “no stuffy formalities” aboard, says Saverimuttu, shown in things such as no dress code, no assigned dining times, and a series of restaurants instead of a central dining room. Virgin Voyages also includes amenities, ranging from WiFi, water and juice, fitness classes, and no “up charges” to create a feeling of value and inclusion at a reasonable price point. Over the four years, however, the messaging has evolved for the product, and Saverimuttu admits they had a hard time finding their voice for the brand. The line painted a picture of differences, but he admits to overplaying a message of “disruption.” They allowed a narrative that at times had people saying, “Maybe it is not for me.” A key part of the elevated onboard experience is the message that has become central to the brand which is “no kids onboard.” Saverimuttu notes the growth in the adults-only vacation segment and believes they are ideally positioned in the North American market as the only moderately priced cruise ships offering the adults-only concept. He says the mega ships appealing to everyone with lots of kids and families is good for the market, but people know on Virgin Voyages, it's all adults. He says that permitted them to use spaces on the ships that might have been for children to increase amenities such as fitness and wellness areas, as well as the elevated dining experiences. They promote over 20 included eateries onboard, featuring six sit-down restaurants. Virgin emphasizes that each of its restaurants has its own galley with no central prep galley. Food is cooked to order. It reduces food waste but also presents an enhanced dining experience for the passengers, which they call “sailors.” To Saverimuttu, the one thing that sets the brand apart, and a message you hear repeatedly all around the ship, is the crew. There are 1,160 crewmembers per ship, which each have a passenger capacity of 2,770. He says the number one reason people rebook is the crew and esprit de corps created by treating the crew well, giving them food similar to the passengers, and encouraging them to be natural and individual. Virgin, he says, has a focus on hiring and gives extensive training because it wants its crew to be happy. It is an attitude that comes from Sir Richard Branson, who says Virgin Voyages is among the best companies in the group. Brilliant Lady with the Manhattan skyline (Virgin Voyages) With the introduction of the fourth ship, Virgin Voyages is diversifying its destinations and the length of its cruises, in part in response to the loyal following that wants new things. Brilliant Lady was redesigned, moving the lifeboats inboard among the changes, so it can transit the Panama Canal, and in 2026, will take Virgin to Alaska for the first time. Aboard, changes were made for more seating indoors, more viewpoints, and new elements such as a Spanish restaurant. Unique entertainment was also developed to create variety among the ships. Part of the concept is to offer travelers the opportunity to trade up from other ships, versus the earlier messages that were focused more on the new-to-cruise segment. Most of the other ships without children aboard are the small, ultra-luxury ships, which, with a higher price point, are unattainable for some people, says Saverimuttu. Virgin’s larger ships offer more amenities than smaller ships, such as dining options, and instead of cruise directors, Virgin has a cast to curate a tailored experience for each passenger. For example, one focuses on the arts, another is the “foodie,” and another is health and wellness focused. Saverimuttu says some of the evolution was planned, but some of it was listening and reacting to the customer, and others are trying new things. Richard Branson came up with the idea of the 30-day sea pass, which Saverimuttu admits they were skeptical about at first, but it sold out and is being repeated. Saverimuttu calls it a “learning moment with Richard.” Four years after the brand’s first cruises, they feel like they have moved the narrative to “something for everyone without kids.” The response is strong with bookings up 70 percent for next year and better than 50 percent rebookings. Brilliant Lady sold out for its first revenue cruise after waiting since delivery from Fincantieri at the beginning of 2024 for its first cruise. It heads to Bermuda and New England, before the Caribbean, and in 2026, through the Panama Canal to Mexico, California, and Alaska. She will continue to do what they are calling the “four corners,” while one of the other lady ships (Scarlet Lady, Valiant Lady, and Resilient Lady) will be year-round for the Caribbean, and two will head seasonally to Europe and the Mediterranean. The launch of Virgin Voyages and now retired CEO Tom McAlpin were featured in the January/February 2020 issue of The Maritime Executive.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 21:27:29
US Issues Stern Warning After “High Provocative Move” by Venezuelan Jets,https://maritime-executive.com/article/us-issues-stern-warning-after-high-provocative-move-by-venezuelan-jets,,05/09/2025 18:51:41,,"The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed in a brief statement that two Venezuelan jets overflew a U.S. warship in international waters in the Caribbean. The U.S. termed it a “highly provocative move,” warning the “cartel running Venezuela” not to interfere with its counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations. CBS News, The New York Times, CNN, Reuters, and others are all reporting that two Venezuelan F-16 jets flew close to a U.S. destroyer in the Caribbean on Thursday. The warship was not identified in the official statement, but off the record, Pentagon sources told the media it was the Arleigh Burke-class Aegis guided missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham. Commissioned in 2010, the vessel is 9,200 tons (displacement) and normally has a complement of 380 aboard. Reuters reports that at least seven U.S. warships have been deployed to the Caribbean carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines. The deployment has drawn criticism from Venezuela and global attention as the Trump administration has vowed to stop drug smuggling. Earlier this year, the administration declared Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua cartel a terrorist organization. Reuters is reporting that 10 U.S. F-35 jets have also been sent to Puerto Rico as part of the ongoing buildup of forces. According to the reports, the two Venezuelan jets flew close to the U.S. warship. USS Jason Dunham did not engage the jets. The Defense statement said, “Today, two Maduro regime military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters. This highly provocative move was designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations. The cartel running Venezuela is strongly advised not to pursue any further effort to obstruct, deter, or interfere ...” The incident came two days after the U.S. military destroyed a speedboat that it said was being used to smuggle drugs. Donald Trump announced the action, saying 11 individuals had been killed in the strike. The administration has asserted that it will continue to pursue these types of strikes to stop drug smuggling. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had told reporters on Wednesday that previous efforts had not stopped the drug smuggling. He said, “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” Earlier on Thursday, before reporting the incident, U.S. Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth defended the actions. He told reporters that the U.S. would continue its activities to stop the threat of illegal narcotics. USS Jason Dunham had been deployed at the start of 2025 as part of the USS Harry S. Truman strike group when they were operating in the Red Sea. The vessel was part of the group when it was repeatedly targeted by the Houthis. The Truman left the region and returned to the United States in June after what the U.S. Navy called one of its “most combat-intensive missions” in decades.",Maritime Executive,05/09/2025 21:27:29

Ernst Russ Orders First New Ships in Years in Partnership with Eimskip,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ernst-russ-orders-first-new-ships-in-years-in-partnership-with-eimskip,,06/09/2025 03:33:03,,"Germany’s Ernst Russ is moving forward with its first newbuild orders in years, an innovative pair of feeder containerships specially designed for Iceland’s Eimskip and the challenges of the North Atlantic. The companies report that the design incorporates future technology while also being specifically designed with customer service needs in mind. The project builds on a partnership between the companies and provides a financial structure to support the newbuild effort. The joint-venture company ElbFeeder, majority owned by Ernst Russ, has signed the contract to build the two vessels with China Merchants Jin Ling Shipyard (Nanjing), while the board of Eimskip approved a 10-year time-charter. “This investment will be a milestone for Ernst Russ, marking our first newbuild investment in decades,” said Joseph Schuchmann, Co-CEO and Chief Commercial Officer of Ernst Russ. “We are delighted to be able to implement it together with our long-standing partner Eimskip, who will also function as the initial long-term charterer and thus contributes significantly to the financial viability of the project.” Due for delivery in the second half of 2028, the vessels will be 185 meters (607 feet) in length with a capacity of 2,280 TEU. They will be the largest vessels in Eimskip’s operation and will be used on the company’s Blue Line sailing between Reykjavik and Rotterdam as well as Teesport in the UK. “We see great opportunities with the delivery of these new vessels, especially considering the ambitious plans to increase exports of fresh seafood and salmon,” said Vilhelm Mar Thorsteinsson, CEO of Eimskip. He notes that the time-charter in combination with the newbuilding contract enables Eimskip to future-proof its Iceland-Europe trade, while ElbFeer secures long-term revenues. The new ships use advanced designs suited to the North Atlantic (Eimskip) The vessels were designed for the demanding conditions of North Atlantic routes in collaboration with the Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute (SDARI). Their optimized hull structure has been engineered to enhance hydrodynamic performance, enabling higher service speeds and maneuverability while maintaining fuel efficiency and operational reliability, ideal for the conditions in the North Atlantic. In addition to the design supporting service speed in an efficient way, they report that the focus is also on optimal energy utilization, including hull design, silicone coating, shore power connection, and other equipment selection. The vessels will also feature a dual-fuel propulsion system, methanol- and LNG-ready. ElbFeeder currently operates a fleet of seven container vessels. The newbuilds will increase the fleet to nine, and options for two additional vessels were negotiated. Eimskip operates a total fleet of 14 vessels, while Ernst Russ manages a fleet of 26 vessels with a focus on smaller containerships, as well as bulkers and multipurpose vessels.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Höegh Autoliners Names Höegh Moonlight at Port of Gothenburg,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hoegh-autoliners-names-hoegh-moonlight-at-port-of-gothenburg,,06/09/2025 03:22:01,,"[By: Höegh Autoliners] Höegh Autoliners today celebrated the naming of its sixth Aurora-Class vessel in commercial operation at Sweden’s leading port and the largest in the Nordic region. The vessel was sponsored by Jenny Westermark, Senior Vice President, GTO Production Logistics at Volvo Group, who performed the traditional bottle-breaking. An array of sustainable Volvo Group cargo provided a spectacular showpiece for the proceedings. With a capacity of 9,100 car equivalent units (CEU), the Höegh Moonlight joins Höegh Autoliners’ flagship series of 12 next-generation pure car and truck carriers (PCTCs). The Aurora Class plays a central role in the company's ambition to reach zero emissions by 2040. All are classed by DNV and fly the Norwegian flag. The fifth sister vessel, the Höegh Sunrise, was named at Omaezaki Port in Japan in June this year. CEO of Höegh Autoliners, Andreas Enger, commented: “The naming of Höegh Moonlight demonstrates our strong commitment to decarbonising deep-sea shipping – not in the future, but right now, today. These vessels are not concepts; they are working, sailing answers to one of the most urgent challenges in our industry. I would like to thank Jenny Westermark for graciously sponsoring the vessel.” “The partnership between Höegh Autoliners and Volvo Group is not just a business alliance. It’s a shared commitment – a joint force – to drive real, lasting change in our industries,” Westermark added. SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARD Built for a low-carbon future, the Aurora Class is the most technically advanced and environmentally friendly series of car carriers ever constructed. All 12 vessels are designed from the keel up to transition to clean fuels, with the first eight powered by LNG via dual-fuel engines. They are also “ammonia-ready” with reinforced decks and an integrated tank developed by TGE Marine at the heart of the design, allowing for straightforward conversion to be able to run on clean ammonia in the future. The final four units in the Aurora newbuilding programme, scheduled for delivery from 2027, are dual-fuel vessels able to operate on ammonia from day one. The eight first dual-fuel LNG powered vessels are estimated to deliver 58% lower emissions per transported car compared to the industry average. Höegh Autoliners COO Sebjørn Dahl said: “The Höegh Moonlight reflects the transformation we are leading across the maritime sector. From the speed of delivery to the scale of innovation onboard, these vessels demonstrate what can be achieved when ambition meets action. We are grateful to our partners, crew and global team for making this possible – together, we're building more than vessels, we're helping to shape a cleaner, smarter future for global trade.” Oskar Orstadius, CSO at Höegh Autoliners, added: “The naming of the Höegh Moonlight marks more than the arrival of a vessel; it's a celebration of our close collaboration with key customers and our shared commitment to sustainable, high-quality transport solutions. We are proud to strengthen these partnerships in a port that plays an important role in our global network, and we would also like to express our sincere appreciation to our agent in Sweden, Scandinavian Shipping and Logistics, who has represented Höegh Autoliners with dedication for more than 20 years.” GREEN PORT STRATEGY Port of Gothenburg CEO Göran Eriksson notes that Höegh Autoliners' traffic at the port plays a vital role in enabling Swedish industry to access global markets. ""With the introduction of these new Höegh vessels, that connection can now be made in an even more efficient and climate-smart way than before. The Port of Gothenburg is committed to becoming a leading bunkering hub for alternative fuels in Northern Europe, and Höegh stands as a strong example of a frontrunner showing that our initiatives as a port are moves in the right direction.” By 2030, the port aims to reduce carbon emissions by 70%, at sea, in the terminal areas and on land. The transition is being carried out in close collaboration with industry, policymakers and academia, with a strong focus on creating sustainable value chains for a thriving society and strengthening business access to global markets. Key components of this effort include investments in shoreside power, green shipping corridors, electrification and the fuels of the future, all driven by close cooperation with stakeholders across the entire transport chain.

President Mulino & Japanese Shipowners Meet to Improve Panama Ship Registry,https://maritime-executive.com/article/president-mulino-japanese-shipowners-meet-to-improve-panama-ship-registry,,06/09/2025 03:08:40,,"[By: Panama Maritime Authority] President José Raúl Mulino met with more than 40 representatives of shipping companies from Japan’s Kanto region, where he presented Panama’s new ship registry strategy aimed at safeguarding its global leadership through enhanced safety standards and fully digitalized processes. Mulino emphasized that Panama’s registry is positioning itself as the flag of the future, driven by new policies aligned with international benchmarks for safety, efficiency, and environmental protection. The stakes are high for Japan: 7 out of 10 Japanese shipowners already fly the Panamanian flag, and 41% of Japan’s total tonnage is registered under Panama. For Panama, consolidating its role as Japan’s preferred registry is vital, as 66% of new shipbuilding comes from the Japanese market. Reflecting on the registry’s long history dating back to the 1920s, Mulino stressed that unlike other registries, Panama’s flag is not a maritime franchise but a national emblem backed by the full weight of the state. He also revealed that his administration is pushing forward a comprehensive modernization plan for the registry, framed within a broader maritime and logistics strategy that integrates the Canal and Panama’s port system. “This plan will bring together our entire maritime cluster under what we now call the National Maritime Strategy—the future of our country,” Mulino declared, pledging to see this project through during his presidency. He underscored his vision of a more flexible Maritime Authority and registry that provides streamlined, user-friendly services. “You can count on Panama’s registry to continue working in favor of the global maritime community, especially Japan,” Mulino told the gathered shipowners. Joining him were Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) Administrator Luis Roquebert and Merchant Marine Director Ramón Franco, both of whom reinforced the president’s message. “Panama has been the world’s natural bridge since ancient times. The creation of our Ship Registry in the early 20th century, alongside the construction of the Canal, positioned the Isthmus as a global benchmark in ship registration—changing the course of maritime history,” Roquebert noted. He highlighted that the PMA has successfully diversified its services, now offering integrated solutions in over 50 countries. “Thanks to our broad network of partners and our expertise, we provide unmatched technical, legal, and diplomatic support,” Roquebert said. For his part, Merchant Marine Director Ramon Franco presented “The Panamanian Ship Registry: Renewing Our Strategy for a New Era,” outlining Panama’s new direction and the competitive advantages it offers. He explained that the Mulino administration’s guiding principle is quality over quantity, focusing on: Franco also underlined Panama’s pioneering role as the first registry to enforce mandatory traceability for ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, part of a strategy to modernize the fleet by gradually phasing out older tonnage and aligning with the IMO’s decarbonization goals for 2050. As of August 25, 2025, Panama’s ship registry includes 8,812 vessels totaling 241.5 million gross tons (GT), according to IHS Markit—representing 14% of the global fleet, based on Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor. Franco reported that the new strategy is already delivering results: fewer accidents and a 13% increase in newbuilding registrations compared to the previous year. He closed by reminding Japanese shipowners that Panama’s registry offers more than just a flag—it comes with the full backing of a country that provides political and economic stability, a robust banking system, special economic zones, investment incentives, world-class logistics hubs, and, of course, the Panama Canal.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
"Construction Starts on First Short-Sea, Ammonia-Fueled Containership",https://maritime-executive.com/article/construction-starts-on-first-short-sea-ammonia-fueled-containership,,06/09/2025 02:36:07,,"Nearly two years after the project was unveiled, construction started today in China for what is likely to become the world’s first ammonia-fueled containership. The project, which is being led by CMB.TECH, as part of its efforts to accelerate the transition in the shipping industry, will launch a vessel that they report will transform short-sea shipping and demonstrate the potential of ammonia as a low-emission fuel. The vessel, which is named Yara Eyde, is being built in China the Qingdao Yangfang Shipbuilding and will be a 1,400 TEU ice-class containership optimized for operations between Norway and Germany. The vessel will be owned by Delphis, the container division of CMB.TECH and operated by NCL Oslofjord, a joint venture between North Sea Container Line and Yara Clean Ammonia. The Norwegian Government, through its Enova Investment Fund, provided approximately $3.6 million in grants to the project. Today, September 5, marked the first day of steel cutting for the vessel. The companies previously said delivery is scheduled for mid-2026. “This is more than the start of a ship – it is the start of a new chapter in maritime decarbonization,” said Hans Olav Raen, CEO of Yara Clean Ammonia. “Yara Eyde embodies our ambition to make low-emission ammonia a reality for shipping and to inspire the industry toward solutions that reduce emissions.” So far, ammonia-fueled shipping has mostly been a few pilot projects as the leading engine manufacturers work to perfect their first offerings and complete certification. The industry is also awaiting the finalization of regulations and is still working to develop the fueling infrastructure and safety protocols for ammonia, which is highly toxic. The potential for ammonia as one of the fuels to address decarbonization, however, has created strong anticipation in the shipping industry. While there are only three vessels currently in service with ammonia as their primary fuel, an offshore supply vessel and two tugboats, there are now 39 ammonia-fueled vessels on order for delivery over the next four years, according to data from DNV. Yara Eyde is set to operate on a route between Oslo, Porsgrunn, Bremerhaven, and Rotterdam. NCL will manage the commercial operations. Yara Clean Ammonia will deliver ammonia fuel to the vessel, while Yara International has entered into a contract for shipping containers between Yara’s fertilizer plant in Porsgrunn, Norway, and Hamburg and Bremerhaven in Germany. In addition to being a demonstration of the potential for ammonia-fueled operations, the goal is to use the ship to drive investment and build industry support for the infrastructure and adoption of ammonia technology. “Yara, NCL, and CMB.TECH are walking the talk to decarbonise shipping by combining our know-how on clean ammonia, operational excellence in the North Sea, and state-of-the-art low-carbon ships,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH in 2023, announcing the project. “We want to prove to the world that we can decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow.”",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Turbines Installed for France’s Pilot Deep Water Floating Wind Project,https://maritime-executive.com/article/turbines-installed-for-france-s-pilot-deep-water-floating-wind-project,,06/09/2025 01:01:18,,"Ocean Winds reports it has successfully completed the third and final turbine installation of its Éoliennes Flottantes du Golfe du Lion (EFGL) project located in southeast France along the Mediterranean. Developed as a pilot project in partnership with Banque des Territoires, EFGL is now the first floating offshore wind farm in the Occitanie region to complete its offshore turbine installation phase. The company highlights that the project marks a major step for floating wind on a global scale. With three 10 MW turbines installed on floating foundations, EFGL demonstrates the viability of floating offshore wind in deeper waters, unlocking high-wind areas previously out of reach. The success of EFGL, the company says, demonstrates floating wind’s readiness to scale, both in France and internationally, contributing to the global acceleration of offshore wind energy. Assembled at Port-La Nouvelle, the turbines were towed 16 km (10 miles) offshore. The turbines are now ready for the final stage of cable and grid connection works done by RTE, before starting to deliver clean energy to approximately 50,000 inhabitants each year. The water depth ranges between 68 and 70 meters (220 to 230 feet). “EFGL is not only a first for France but a global benchmark for floating offshore wind,” said Marc Hirt, Country Manager France for Ocean Winds. “It showcases the industrial maturity, precision, and collaboration needed to bring floating wind to commercial scale.” Ocean Winds, an international offshore wind energy company created by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, is at the forefront of the development of floating wind turbines. The company has five years of operating its 25 MW WindFloat Atlantic project in Portugal. It said the successful installation of EFGL paves the way for larger developments, including the Eoliennes Flottantes d’Occitanie (EFLO), a 250 MW floating offshore wind project awarded to OW and Banque des Territoires in late 2024.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Philippines Hails Shipbuilding Revival as HD KSOE Starts at Subic Yard,https://maritime-executive.com/article/philippines-hails-shipbuilding-revival-as-hd-ksoe-starts-at-subic-yard,,06/09/2025 00:28:24,,"The Philippines is celebrating the revival of its shipbuilding industry after South Korean giant HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) commenced the construction of a large bulk carrier at its newly leased facility in Subic Bay, Philippines. It will be the first large ship to be built in the country since 2019. In a significant move that the Philippines expects will help the country reclaim its position among the world’s leading shipbuilding nations, HD KSOE held a steel-cutting ceremony at Subic Shipyard to mark the start of the building of a 115,000-tonne petrochemical carrier. The vessel will be the first to be built at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Philippines (HHIP) and is the first of a four-vessel order placed by an unnamed Asia-based shipping company in December. The commencement of the project is of significant importance to the Philippines, a country that had a long tradition of shipbuilding until 2019, when the industry melted down during the financial crisis and slowdown in shipbuilding. At its pinnacle, the country used to produce up to two million gross tonnes of ships annually and was one of the major contributors to economic growth and job creation. With the South Korean giant investing $180 million this year in the revival of the Subic Shipyard and another $50 million expected to be invested by 2030, the Philippines expects massive economic benefits. Currently employing 1,200 people, the yard is expected to employ 4,300 people by 2030. “Together with our partners, we are reviving shipbuilding in the country to strengthen industries, promote livelihood, and build a better, stronger future for the Philippines,” said President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr during the ceremonies. “Today, we will begin reclaiming our rightful place among the world’s great shipbuilding nations.” HHIP, a wholly owned subsidiary of HD KSOE, signed a 10-year lease for Subic Shipyard last year. The U.S. private equity fund Cerberus Capital took rights to the broader facility, as part of a plan to create a manufacturing and industrial park in Subic Bay. In 2022, Cerberus paid $300 million to acquire the distressed Subic Bay shipyard from the former HJ Heavy Industries, which went bankrupt in 2019. It has invested $40 million to revitalize operations on the 300-hectare facility now known as the Agila Subic Shipyard. Located in Zambales Province on the western coast of Luzon, the facility has become a vital strategic hub for shipbuilding, subsea infrastructure, and logistics operations. HD KSOE is commencing ship construction in the facility just a week after Cerberus and HD Hyundai announced the formation of a strategic partnership that saw the launch of Cerberus Maritime. Through the partnership, the two companies hope to play an instrumental role in the “Make America Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) projects. The South Korean company has already announced plans to utilize the Philippines yard as a strategic stronghold for the MASGA project, which is a joint Seoul-Washington shipbuilding cooperation initiative. “Backed by government support, natural advantages, and a skilled workforce, the Philippines is emerging as a rising shipbuilding nation,” said Kim Sung-joon, HD KSOE CEO. “We will leverage HD Hyundai Subic Shipyard to further enhance our global competitiveness.” During the site visit in August, reporters were told the goal is to build up to 10 ships a year within the next three to five years. The initial plan is to use the yard to build product carriers measuring 656 to 820 feet (200 to 250 meters) in length. The ships will be built in 16 to 18 months, and they also anticipate using the yard for offshore structures to support the wind energy sector.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Lloyd’s Register Launches Risk-Based Containership Fire Safety Notation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/lloyd-s-register-launches-risk-based-containership-fire-safety-notation,,05/09/2025 23:54:56,,"[By: Lloyd’s Register] The new notation benefits designers, shipyards, owners, and operators as they plan next-generation container ships or consider retrofits and fleet upgrades. Lloyd’s Register (LR) has launched Fire (C, Risk), a new risk-based notation developed to enhance the assessment of fire safety arrangements on board container ships. The notation is accompanied by guidance to support shipowners, designers, and operators in selecting appropriate, best-practice mitigations based on the specific fire risk profile of a vessel. The new notation, introduced in the July 2025 update to LR’s Rules and Regulations for the Classification of Ships, is the first of its kind to apply the LR ShipRight Risk Based Certification (RBC) methodology to container ship fire safety. This provides a flexible yet robust framework for identifying and validating tailored safety enhancements, from the design phase through to operational deployment. By aligning with the RBC framework, Fire (C, Risk) also supports LR’s broader goals around innovation and assimilation of new technology, digitalisation and data-driven design verification. Gabriele Sancin, LR’s Risk Notation Technical Lead, said: “LR understands that there are many options to enhance container ship fire safety, from advanced detection systems to alternative hold arrangements and smart suppression technologies. Our new notation Fire (C, Risk) ensures that tailored, effective fire safety solutions are selected from demonstrated best practice to reduce risk to crew, cargo and operations.” The notation and accompanying guidance are now available via the latest edition of LR’s Rules and Regulations.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Video: Israeli Navy Conducts Coastal Exercise as New Gaza Flotilla Forms,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-israeli-navy-conducts-coastal-exercise-as-new-gaza-flotilla-forms,,05/09/2025 23:27:54,,"The Israeli Navy is highlighting that it is conducting coastal defense training in conjunction with the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade. These efforts are in advance of the potential arrival off the coast of a flotilla of activists seeking to open a humanitarian corridor into Gaza. The Global Sumud Flotilla Mission, with Greta Thunberg on board the MY Sirius, set off from Barcelona on August 31, but had to return to port because of bad weather. The twenty boats set off again the next day, and hope to rendezvous with other flotillas from Catania and Tunis before reaching the Gaza coast in ten days. About 350 pro-Palestinian activists are on board with as many as 30 or more small boats expected to participate. The protestors’ efforts, however, have been turned back twice by the Israelis, and there is no indication that they will let the larger flotilla proceed. The Israeli Navy employed peaceful tactics to apprehend the last flotilla in June, taking those on board to Ashdod before deporting them. These tactics may have been adopted after 10 activists on board the MV Mavi Marmara were killed when their vessel was intercepted by Israeli commandos in 2010, an incident which provoked a crisis in Turkish-Israeli relations. The Israeli Navy and Gaza Division held a joint exercise Monday to boost maritime border defense, practicing combat scenarios and emergency procedures to enhance coordination and readiness between naval and ground forces. pic.twitter.com/TZ6GZn2cvx From the nature of the Israeli Navy’s exercises, Israel is at least preparing for a worst-case scenario, with the hard-right Israeli Justice Minister calling for anybody arrested on board the flotilla to be subject to prison sentences in the Ktzi'ot and Damon detention centers. Others are suggesting that the activists be allowed to land in Gaza, and as an act of solidarity and protest to share the plight of Palestinians trapped in Gaza. The Israeli response to any closing on the Gaza coastline is, however, likely to be primarily influenced by the need to ensure that such events do not occur again. Whatever tactics the Israeli Navy employs, their biggest challenge is likely to be the number of vessels sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla, which could overwhelm the number of patrol boats the Israelis have available to interdict them. The Israeli Navy operates seven Shaldag Class high-speed patrol boats and 18 Super Dvora Class fast patrol boats for coastal patrol duties, and may have to call on helicopters and their 15 larger Sa'ar Class missile boats. Some of Sa'ar Class boats are in the Red Sea, covering the threat from the Houthis. Others are needed for high-priority tasks off the Lebanese and Gaza coasts. Hence the Global Sumud Flotilla is likely to impact ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza if it comes within range. The latest from the flotilla is that they expect to set off from Tunis on Sunday, September 7. They are expected to reach the Israeli coast and Gaza around mid-month.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43

They said the effort was a demonstration of the cross-border cooperation and that it was a major victory against international drug trafficking. Working with their counterparts in Brazil, the South African Revenue Services (SARS) reports the intelligence-driven operation had targeted suspect containers bound for Durban. A Customs Marine Patrol boat intercepted the unidentified cargo ship while it was in the outer anchorage approximately four nautical miles east of Durban. They escorted the vessel to its berth in the port. Once docked, customs enforcement officers boarded the ship and began a search. They located a number of containers that had been flagged during the intelligence phase as posing a risk for smuggling. The containers were searched, and they discovered a total of 25 large bricks hidden in the refrigeration units of the containers. A field test confirmed the presence of cocaine, and it was handed over to the South African Police Service for further investigation and prosecution. Edward Kieswetter, SARS Commissioner, commended the officers for their efforts. He commented that “this success points to the success of collaboration with our counterparts from Brazil. It is such collaboration that communicates concrete cooperation within BRICS countries that deals a heavy blow against organized crime syndicates. This achievement also signals that the efforts by all law enforcement agencies in our county are taking on the challenge of protecting our borders.” The police gave the seizure an estimated value of $3.2 million. They further reported that the cocaine was of a very high quality suitable for further dilution. They expected that it would have been expanded into larger volumes for distribution.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43
Report: Denmark and Sweden Are Close to Orders for UK Frigates,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-denmark-and-sweden-are-close-to-orders-for-uk-frigates,,05/09/2025 21:08:16,,"UK naval shipbuilding appears to be on the verge of a major surge in new orders. According to a report in the Financial Times, hot on the heels of Norway’s decision last week to acquire British Type 26 frigates, Denmark and Sweden are in “advanced talks” to acquire British Type 31 frigates. Negotiations with Denmark are in the closing stages, according to the Financial Times, while Sweden is still considering a French option as well. Contract negotiations, the BBC reports, have been underway for more than a year, and the decisions are expected within the next six months. BBC estimates the value of the Danish contract at more than £1billion. Whereas the Type 26 is a specialist anti-submarine warfare platform built by BAE, the Type 31 “Arrowhead 140” is built by Babcock at Rosyth in Scotland, and has a multi-functional role. The Royal Navy has ordered five Type 31s. The design has also been sold to Indonesia and Poland for domestic manufacture. HMS Venturer (F12) is expected for Royal Navy service in 2027 (Royal Navy) The first of class, HMS Venturer (F12), was semi-launched in June and has now been fitted with its 24-ton mast. It seems likely to come into full service with the Royal Navy in 2027. HMS Active, the second in class, is still in the assembly shed in Rosyth, and is following about six months behind. The last of what will be known as the Inspiration Class, HMS Campbelltown, is scheduled to come into service in May 2030. Inevitably, there may be delays if production slots are reallocated to new purchasers, to the detriment of the Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the new orders and accelerated production will have the effect of increasing the overall number of vessels available to NATO. The Inspiration Class will be fitted with a vertical launch system able to launch Standard Missile SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6s, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and SeaSparrow short-range anti-missiles. The frigates will have a hangar for a Merlin or Wildcat helicopter, a launch capability for three 8m Pacific 24 rigid inflatable boats, and a flexi-use space plumbed into the ship’s combat system for six TEU containers, with configuration dependent on mission. The Norwegian order, the previous purchase of the Type 31 design by Poland, and these potential Danish and Swedish orders are a reflection of the emphasis that the United Kingdom has placed on working with Northern European countries within the NATO context. In May 2022, the government of Boris Johnson took the lead in offering the security support of a nuclear nation to the governments of Finland and Sweden, while both contemplated joining NATO. The Joint Expeditionary Force was formed in London in 2014 to better integrate high-readiness forces of member nations, and is currently made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 04:26:43

The project builds on a partnership between the companies and provides a financial structure to support the newbuild effort. The joint-venture company ElbFeeder, majority owned by Ernst Russ, has signed the contract to build the two vessels with China Merchants Jin Ling Shipyard (Nanjing), while the board of Eimskip approved a 10-year time-charter. “This investment will be a milestone for Ernst Russ, marking our first newbuild investment in decades,” said Joseph Schuchmann, Co-CEO and Chief Commercial Officer of Ernst Russ. “We are delighted to be able to implement it together with our long-standing partner Eimskip, who will also function as the initial long-term charterer and thus contributes significantly to the financial viability of the project.” Due for delivery in the second half of 2028, the vessels will be 185 meters (607 feet) in length with a capacity of 2,280 TEU. They will be the largest vessels in Eimskip’s operation and will be used on the company’s Blue Line sailing between Reykjavik and Rotterdam as well as Teesport in the UK. “We see great opportunities with the delivery of these new vessels, especially considering the ambitious plans to increase exports of fresh seafood and salmon,” said Vilhelm Mar Thorsteinsson, CEO of Eimskip. He notes that the time-charter in combination with the newbuilding contract enables Eimskip to future-proof its Iceland-Europe trade, while ElbFeer secures long-term revenues. The new ships use advanced designs suited to the North Atlantic (Eimskip) The vessels were designed for the demanding conditions of North Atlantic routes in collaboration with the Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute (SDARI). Their optimized hull structure has been engineered to enhance hydrodynamic performance, enabling higher service speeds and maneuverability while maintaining fuel efficiency and operational reliability, ideal for the conditions in the North Atlantic. In addition to the design supporting service speed in an efficient way, they report that the focus is also on optimal energy utilization, including hull design, silicone coating, shore power connection, and other equipment selection. The vessels will also feature a dual-fuel propulsion system, methanol- and LNG-ready. ElbFeeder currently operates a fleet of seven container vessels. The newbuilds will increase the fleet to nine, and options for two additional vessels were negotiated. Eimskip operates a total fleet of 14 vessels, while Ernst Russ manages a fleet of 26 vessels with a focus on smaller containerships, as well as bulkers and multipurpose vessels.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
Höegh Autoliners Names Höegh Moonlight at Port of Gothenburg,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hoegh-autoliners-names-hoegh-moonlight-at-port-of-gothenburg,,06/09/2025 03:22:01,,"[By: Höegh Autoliners] Höegh Autoliners today celebrated the naming of its sixth Aurora-Class vessel in commercial operation at Sweden’s leading port and the largest in the Nordic region. The vessel was sponsored by Jenny Westermark, Senior Vice President, GTO Production Logistics at Volvo Group, who performed the traditional bottle-breaking. An array of sustainable Volvo Group cargo provided a spectacular showpiece for the proceedings. With a capacity of 9,100 car equivalent units (CEU), the Höegh Moonlight joins Höegh Autoliners’ flagship series of 12 next-generation pure car and truck carriers (PCTCs). The Aurora Class plays a central role in the company's ambition to reach zero emissions by 2040. All are classed by DNV and fly the Norwegian flag. The fifth sister vessel, the Höegh Sunrise, was named at Omaezaki Port in Japan in June this year. CEO of Höegh Autoliners, Andreas Enger, commented: “The naming of Höegh Moonlight demonstrates our strong commitment to decarbonising deep-sea shipping – not in the future, but right now, today. These vessels are not concepts; they are working, sailing answers to one of the most urgent challenges in our industry. I would like to thank Jenny Westermark for graciously sponsoring the vessel.” “The partnership between Höegh Autoliners and Volvo Group is not just a business alliance. It’s a shared commitment – a joint force – to drive real, lasting change in our industries,” Westermark added. SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARD Built for a low-carbon future, the Aurora Class is the most technically advanced and environmentally friendly series of car carriers ever constructed. All 12 vessels are designed from the keel up to transition to clean fuels, with the first eight powered by LNG via dual-fuel engines. They are also “ammonia-ready” with reinforced decks and an integrated tank developed by TGE Marine at the heart of the design, allowing for straightforward conversion to be able to run on clean ammonia in the future. The final four units in the Aurora newbuilding programme, scheduled for delivery from 2027, are dual-fuel vessels able to operate on ammonia from day one. The eight first dual-fuel LNG powered vessels are estimated to deliver 58% lower emissions per transported car compared to the industry average. Höegh Autoliners COO Sebjørn Dahl said: “The Höegh Moonlight reflects the transformation we are leading across the maritime sector. From the speed of delivery to the scale of innovation onboard, these vessels demonstrate what can be achieved when ambition meets action. We are grateful to our partners, crew and global team for making this possible – together, we're building more than vessels, we're helping to shape a cleaner, smarter future for global trade.” Oskar Orstadius, CSO at Höegh Autoliners, added: “The naming of the Höegh Moonlight marks more than the arrival of a vessel; it's a celebration of our close collaboration with key customers and our shared commitment to sustainable, high-quality transport solutions. We are proud to strengthen these partnerships in a port that plays an important role in our global network, and we would also like to express our sincere appreciation to our agent in Sweden, Scandinavian Shipping and Logistics, who has represented Höegh Autoliners with dedication for more than 20 years.” GREEN PORT STRATEGY Port of Gothenburg CEO Göran Eriksson notes that Höegh Autoliners' traffic at the port plays a vital role in enabling Swedish industry to access global markets. ""With the introduction of these new Höegh vessels, that connection can now be made in an even more efficient and climate-smart way than before. The Port of Gothenburg is committed to becoming a leading bunkering hub for alternative fuels in Northern Europe, and Höegh stands as a strong example of a frontrunner showing that our initiatives as a port are moves in the right direction.” By 2030, the port aims to reduce carbon emissions by 70%, at sea, in the terminal areas and on land. The transition is being carried out in close collaboration with industry, policymakers and academia, with a strong focus on creating sustainable value chains for a thriving society and strengthening business access to global markets. Key components of this effort include investments in shoreside power, green shipping corridors, electrification and the fuels of the future, all driven by close cooperation with stakeholders across the entire transport chain.

President Mulino & Japanese Shipowners Meet to Improve Panama Ship Registry,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/president-mulino-japanese-shipowners-meet-to-improve-panama-ship-registry,,06/09/2025 03:08:40,,"[By: Panama Maritime Authority] President José Raúl Mulino met with more than 40 representatives of shipping companies from Japan’s Kanto region, where he presented Panama’s new ship registry strategy aimed at safeguarding its global leadership through enhanced safety standards and fully digitalized processes. Mulino emphasized that Panama’s registry is positioning itself as the flag of the future, driven by new policies aligned with international benchmarks for safety, efficiency, and environmental protection. The stakes are high for Japan: 7 out of 10 Japanese shipowners already fly the Panamanian flag, and 41% of Japan’s total tonnage is registered under Panama. For Panama, consolidating its role as Japan’s preferred registry is vital, as 66% of new shipbuilding comes from the Japanese market. Reflecting on the registry’s long history dating back to the 1920s, Mulino stressed that unlike other registries, Panama’s flag is not a maritime franchise but a national emblem backed by the full weight of the state. He also revealed that his administration is pushing forward a comprehensive modernization plan for the registry, framed within a broader maritime and logistics strategy that integrates the Canal and Panama’s port system. “This plan will bring together our entire maritime cluster under what we now call the National Maritime Strategy—the future of our country,” Mulino declared, pledging to see this project through during his presidency. He underscored his vision of a more flexible Maritime Authority and registry that provides streamlined, user-friendly services. “You can count on Panama’s registry to continue working in favor of the global maritime community, especially Japan,” Mulino told the gathered shipowners. Joining him were Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) Administrator Luis Roquebert and Merchant Marine Director Ramón Franco, both of whom reinforced the president’s message. “Panama has been the world’s natural bridge since ancient times. The creation of our Ship Registry in the early 20th century, alongside the construction of the Canal, positioned the Isthmus as a global benchmark in ship registration—changing the course of maritime history,” Roquebert noted. He highlighted that the PMA has successfully diversified its services, now offering integrated solutions in over 50 countries. “Thanks to our broad network of partners and our expertise, we provide unmatched technical, legal, and diplomatic support,” Roquebert said. For his part, Merchant Marine Director Ramon Franco presented “The Panamanian Ship Registry: Renewing Our Strategy for a New Era,” outlining Panama’s new direction and the competitive advantages it offers. He explained that the Mulino administration’s guiding principle is quality over quantity, focusing on: Franco also underlined Panama’s pioneering role as the first registry to enforce mandatory traceability for ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, part of a strategy to modernize the fleet by gradually phasing out older tonnage and aligning with the IMO’s decarbonization goals for 2050. As of August 25, 2025, Panama’s ship registry includes 8,812 vessels totaling 241.5 million gross tons (GT), according to IHS Markit—representing 14% of the global fleet, based on Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor. Franco reported that the new strategy is already delivering results: fewer accidents and a 13% increase in newbuilding registrations compared to the previous year. He closed by reminding Japanese shipowners that Panama’s registry offers more than just a flag—it comes with the full backing of a country that provides political and economic stability, a robust banking system, special economic zones, investment incentives, world-class logistics hubs, and, of course, the Panama Canal.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
"Construction Starts on First Short-Sea, Ammonia-Fueled Containership",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/construction-starts-on-first-short-sea-ammonia-fueled-containership,,06/09/2025 02:36:07,,"Nearly two years after the project was unveiled, construction started today in China for what is likely to become the world’s first ammonia-fueled containership. The project, which is being led by CMB.TECH, as part of its efforts to accelerate the transition in the shipping industry, will launch a vessel that they report will transform short-sea shipping and demonstrate the potential of ammonia as a low-emission fuel. The vessel, which is named Yara Eyde, is being built in China the Qingdao Yangfang Shipbuilding and will be a 1,400 TEU ice-class containership optimized for operations between Norway and Germany. The vessel will be owned by Delphis, the container division of CMB.TECH and operated by NCL Oslofjord, a joint venture between North Sea Container Line and Yara Clean Ammonia. The Norwegian Government, through its Enova Investment Fund, provided approximately $3.6 million in grants to the project. Today, September 5, marked the first day of steel cutting for the vessel. The companies previously said delivery is scheduled for mid-2026. “This is more than the start of a ship – it is the start of a new chapter in maritime decarbonization,” said Hans Olav Raen, CEO of Yara Clean Ammonia. “Yara Eyde embodies our ambition to make low-emission ammonia a reality for shipping and to inspire the industry toward solutions that reduce emissions.” So far, ammonia-fueled shipping has mostly been a few pilot projects as the leading engine manufacturers work to perfect their first offerings and complete certification. The industry is also awaiting the finalization of regulations and is still working to develop the fueling infrastructure and safety protocols for ammonia, which is highly toxic. The potential for ammonia as one of the fuels to address decarbonization, however, has created strong anticipation in the shipping industry. While there are only three vessels currently in service with ammonia as their primary fuel, an offshore supply vessel and two tugboats, there are now 39 ammonia-fueled vessels on order for delivery over the next four years, according to data from DNV. Yara Eyde is set to operate on a route between Oslo, Porsgrunn, Bremerhaven, and Rotterdam. NCL will manage the commercial operations. Yara Clean Ammonia will deliver ammonia fuel to the vessel, while Yara International has entered into a contract for shipping containers between Yara’s fertilizer plant in Porsgrunn, Norway, and Hamburg and Bremerhaven in Germany. In addition to being a demonstration of the potential for ammonia-fueled operations, the goal is to use the ship to drive investment and build industry support for the infrastructure and adoption of ammonia technology. “Yara, NCL, and CMB.TECH are walking the talk to decarbonise shipping by combining our know-how on clean ammonia, operational excellence in the North Sea, and state-of-the-art low-carbon ships,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH in 2023, announcing the project. “We want to prove to the world that we can decarbonise today to navigate tomorrow.”",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
Turbines Installed for France’s Pilot Deep Water Floating Wind Project,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/turbines-installed-for-france-s-pilot-deep-water-floating-wind-project,,06/09/2025 01:01:18,,"Ocean Winds reports it has successfully completed the third and final turbine installation of its Éoliennes Flottantes du Golfe du Lion (EFGL) project located in southeast France along the Mediterranean. Developed as a pilot project in partnership with Banque des Territoires, EFGL is now the first floating offshore wind farm in the Occitanie region to complete its offshore turbine installation phase. The company highlights that the project marks a major step for floating wind on a global scale. With three 10 MW turbines installed on floating foundations, EFGL demonstrates the viability of floating offshore wind in deeper waters, unlocking high-wind areas previously out of reach. The success of EFGL, the company says, demonstrates floating wind’s readiness to scale, both in France and internationally, contributing to the global acceleration of offshore wind energy. Assembled at Port-La Nouvelle, the turbines were towed 16 km (10 miles) offshore. The turbines are now ready for the final stage of cable and grid connection works done by RTE, before starting to deliver clean energy to approximately 50,000 inhabitants each year. The water depth ranges between 68 and 70 meters (220 to 230 feet). “EFGL is not only a first for France but a global benchmark for floating offshore wind,” said Marc Hirt, Country Manager France for Ocean Winds. “It showcases the industrial maturity, precision, and collaboration needed to bring floating wind to commercial scale.” Ocean Winds, an international offshore wind energy company created by EDP Renewables and ENGIE, is at the forefront of the development of floating wind turbines. The company has five years of operating its 25 MW WindFloat Atlantic project in Portugal. It said the successful installation of EFGL paves the way for larger developments, including the Eoliennes Flottantes d’Occitanie (EFLO), a 250 MW floating offshore wind project awarded to OW and Banque des Territoires in late 2024.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
Philippines Hails Shipbuilding Revival as HD KSOE Starts at Subic Yard,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/philippines-hails-shipbuilding-revival-as-hd-ksoe-starts-at-subic-yard,,06/09/2025 00:28:24,,"The Philippines is celebrating the revival of its shipbuilding industry after South Korean giant HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (HD KSOE) commenced the construction of a large bulk carrier at its newly leased facility in Subic Bay, Philippines. It will be the first large ship to be built in the country since 2019. In a significant move that the Philippines expects will help the country reclaim its position among the world’s leading shipbuilding nations, HD KSOE held a steel-cutting ceremony at Subic Shipyard to mark the start of the building of a 115,000-tonne petrochemical carrier. The vessel will be the first to be built at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Philippines (HHIP) and is the first of a four-vessel order placed by an unnamed Asia-based shipping company in December. The commencement of the project is of significant importance to the Philippines, a country that had a long tradition of shipbuilding until 2019, when the industry melted down during the financial crisis and slowdown in shipbuilding. At its pinnacle, the country used to produce up to two million gross tonnes of ships annually and was one of the major contributors to economic growth and job creation. With the South Korean giant investing $180 million this year in the revival of the Subic Shipyard and another $50 million expected to be invested by 2030, the Philippines expects massive economic benefits. Currently employing 1,200 people, the yard is expected to employ 4,300 people by 2030. “Together with our partners, we are reviving shipbuilding in the country to strengthen industries, promote livelihood, and build a better, stronger future for the Philippines,” said President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr during the ceremonies. “Today, we will begin reclaiming our rightful place among the world’s great shipbuilding nations.” HHIP, a wholly owned subsidiary of HD KSOE, signed a 10-year lease for Subic Shipyard last year. The U.S. private equity fund Cerberus Capital took rights to the broader facility, as part of a plan to create a manufacturing and industrial park in Subic Bay. In 2022, Cerberus paid $300 million to acquire the distressed Subic Bay shipyard from the former HJ Heavy Industries, which went bankrupt in 2019. It has invested $40 million to revitalize operations on the 300-hectare facility now known as the Agila Subic Shipyard. Located in Zambales Province on the western coast of Luzon, the facility has become a vital strategic hub for shipbuilding, subsea infrastructure, and logistics operations. HD KSOE is commencing ship construction in the facility just a week after Cerberus and HD Hyundai announced the formation of a strategic partnership that saw the launch of Cerberus Maritime. Through the partnership, the two companies hope to play an instrumental role in the “Make America Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) projects. The South Korean company has already announced plans to utilize the Philippines yard as a strategic stronghold for the MASGA project, which is a joint Seoul-Washington shipbuilding cooperation initiative. “Backed by government support, natural advantages, and a skilled workforce, the Philippines is emerging as a rising shipbuilding nation,” said Kim Sung-joon, HD KSOE CEO. “We will leverage HD Hyundai Subic Shipyard to further enhance our global competitiveness.” During the site visit in August, reporters were told the goal is to build up to 10 ships a year within the next three to five years. The initial plan is to use the yard to build product carriers measuring 656 to 820 feet (200 to 250 meters) in length. The ships will be built in 16 to 18 months, and they also anticipate using the yard for offshore structures to support the wind energy sector.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
Lloyd’s Register Launches Risk-Based Containership Fire Safety Notation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/lloyd-s-register-launches-risk-based-containership-fire-safety-notation,,05/09/2025 23:54:56,,"[By: Lloyd’s Register] The new notation benefits designers, shipyards, owners, and operators as they plan next-generation container ships or consider retrofits and fleet upgrades. Lloyd’s Register (LR) has launched Fire (C, Risk), a new risk-based notation developed to enhance the assessment of fire safety arrangements on board container ships. The notation is accompanied by guidance to support shipowners, designers, and operators in selecting appropriate, best-practice mitigations based on the specific fire risk profile of a vessel. The new notation, introduced in the July 2025 update to LR’s Rules and Regulations for the Classification of Ships, is the first of its kind to apply the LR ShipRight Risk Based Certification (RBC) methodology to container ship fire safety. This provides a flexible yet robust framework for identifying and validating tailored safety enhancements, from the design phase through to operational deployment. By aligning with the RBC framework, Fire (C, Risk) also supports LR’s broader goals around innovation and assimilation of new technology, digitalisation and data-driven design verification. Gabriele Sancin, LR’s Risk Notation Technical Lead, said: “LR understands that there are many options to enhance container ship fire safety, from advanced detection systems to alternative hold arrangements and smart suppression technologies. Our new notation Fire (C, Risk) ensures that tailored, effective fire safety solutions are selected from demonstrated best practice to reduce risk to crew, cargo and operations.” The notation and accompanying guidance are now available via the latest edition of LR’s Rules and Regulations.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55

These efforts are in advance of the potential arrival off the coast of a flotilla of activists seeking to open a humanitarian corridor into Gaza. The Global Sumud Flotilla Mission, with Greta Thunberg on board the MY Sirius, set off from Barcelona on August 31, but had to return to port because of bad weather. The twenty boats set off again the next day, and hope to rendezvous with other flotillas from Catania and Tunis before reaching the Gaza coast in ten days. About 350 pro-Palestinian activists are on board with as many as 30 or more small boats expected to participate. The protestors’ efforts, however, have been turned back twice by the Israelis, and there is no indication that they will let the larger flotilla proceed. The Israeli Navy employed peaceful tactics to apprehend the last flotilla in June, taking those on board to Ashdod before deporting them. These tactics may have been adopted after 10 activists on board the MV Mavi Marmara were killed when their vessel was intercepted by Israeli commandos in 2010, an incident which provoked a crisis in Turkish-Israeli relations. The Israeli Navy and Gaza Division held a joint exercise Monday to boost maritime border defense, practicing combat scenarios and emergency procedures to enhance coordination and readiness between naval and ground forces. pic.twitter.com/TZ6GZn2cvx From the nature of the Israeli Navy’s exercises, Israel is at least preparing for a worst-case scenario, with the hard-right Israeli Justice Minister calling for anybody arrested on board the flotilla to be subject to prison sentences in the Ktzi'ot and Damon detention centers. Others are suggesting that the activists be allowed to land in Gaza, and as an act of solidarity and protest to share the plight of Palestinians trapped in Gaza. The Israeli response to any closing on the Gaza coastline is, however, likely to be primarily influenced by the need to ensure that such events do not occur again. Whatever tactics the Israeli Navy employs, their biggest challenge is likely to be the number of vessels sailing with the Global Sumud Flotilla, which could overwhelm the number of patrol boats the Israelis have available to interdict them. The Israeli Navy operates seven Shaldag Class high-speed patrol boats and 18 Super Dvora Class fast patrol boats for coastal patrol duties, and may have to call on helicopters and their 15 larger Sa'ar Class missile boats. Some of Sa'ar Class boats are in the Red Sea, covering the threat from the Houthis. Others are needed for high-priority tasks off the Lebanese and Gaza coasts. Hence the Global Sumud Flotilla is likely to impact ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza if it comes within range. The latest from the flotilla is that they expect to set off from Tunis on Sunday, September 7. They are expected to reach the Israeli coast and Gaza around mid-month.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55

They said the effort was a demonstration of the cross-border cooperation and that it was a major victory against international drug trafficking. Working with their counterparts in Brazil, the South African Revenue Services (SARS) reports the intelligence-driven operation had targeted suspect containers bound for Durban. A Customs Marine Patrol boat intercepted the unidentified cargo ship while it was in the outer anchorage approximately four nautical miles east of Durban. They escorted the vessel to its berth in the port. Once docked, customs enforcement officers boarded the ship and began a search. They located a number of containers that had been flagged during the intelligence phase as posing a risk for smuggling. The containers were searched, and they discovered a total of 25 large bricks hidden in the refrigeration units of the containers. A field test confirmed the presence of cocaine, and it was handed over to the South African Police Service for further investigation and prosecution. Edward Kieswetter, SARS Commissioner, commended the officers for their efforts. He commented that “this success points to the success of collaboration with our counterparts from Brazil. It is such collaboration that communicates concrete cooperation within BRICS countries that deals a heavy blow against organized crime syndicates. This achievement also signals that the efforts by all law enforcement agencies in our county are taking on the challenge of protecting our borders.” The police gave the seizure an estimated value of $3.2 million. They further reported that the cocaine was of a very high quality suitable for further dilution. They expected that it would have been expanded into larger volumes for distribution.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55

It seems likely to come into full service with the Royal Navy in 2027. HMS Active, the second in class, is still in the assembly shed in Rosyth, and is following about six months behind. The last of what will be known as the Inspiration Class, HMS Campbelltown, is scheduled to come into service in May 2030. Inevitably, there may be delays if production slots are reallocated to new purchasers, to the detriment of the Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the new orders and accelerated production will have the effect of increasing the overall number of vessels available to NATO. The Inspiration Class will be fitted with a vertical launch system able to launch Standard Missile SM-2, SM-3, and SM-6s, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and SeaSparrow short-range anti-missiles. The frigates will have a hangar for a Merlin or Wildcat helicopter, a launch capability for three 8m Pacific 24 rigid inflatable boats, and a flexi-use space plumbed into the ship’s combat system for six TEU containers, with configuration dependent on mission. The Norwegian order, the previous purchase of the Type 31 design by Poland, and these potential Danish and Swedish orders are a reflection of the emphasis that the United Kingdom has placed on working with Northern European countries within the NATO context. In May 2022, the government of Boris Johnson took the lead in offering the security support of a nuclear nation to the governments of Finland and Sweden, while both contemplated joining NATO. The Joint Expeditionary Force was formed in London in 2014 to better integrate high-readiness forces of member nations, and is currently made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
Virgin Voyages Hits its Stride as Fourth Ship Enters Service,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/virgin-voyages-hits-its-stride-as-fourth-ship-enters-service,,05/09/2025 19:36:59,,"Virgin Voyages is marking a key milestone as its fourth cruise ship, Brilliant Lady, embarks its first revenue passengers on Friday, September 5, for the so-titled “MerMaiden Cruise” aboard the lady ship. The company admits it took time to find its voice and refine its message, complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, but now it believes it is in a strong position with rapidly growing bookings and a strong base of loyal cruisers anxious for more product. Planning for a cruise line to build on Sir Richard Branson’s unique style and framed Virgin Group started nearly 15 years ago, with the group pulling the trigger on what turned into a nearly €3 billion investment, ordering three 110,000 gross ton cruise ships from Fincantieri in 2016 and a fourth in 2018. The launch was timed for what turned out to be the first weeks of the global pandemic in 2020 and forced the delayed entry of each of the ships into service. Virgin Voyages took the unusual strategy of holding the ships for up to 18 months in warm layup before starting revenue operations. The company remained focused on the launch, executing it well, and keeping the standards for the product high. Nirmal Saverimuttu, who led the exploration and development of the cruise plan for Virgin Group and became Chief Executive Officer in September 2023, says they remained focused on key elements of the onboard experience, which, for him, include the food concepts, the crew, and the elevated experiences onboard. Nirmal Saverimuttu highlights the crew and the experiences on board as what makes the ships unique (Virgin Voyages) The pillars of the brand were “no stuffy formalities” aboard, says Saverimuttu, shown in things such as no dress code, no assigned dining times, and a series of restaurants instead of a central dining room. Virgin Voyages also includes amenities, ranging from WiFi, water and juice, fitness classes, and no “up charges” to create a feeling of value and inclusion at a reasonable price point. Over the four years, however, the messaging has evolved for the product, and Saverimuttu admits they had a hard time finding their voice for the brand. The line painted a picture of differences, but he admits to overplaying a message of “disruption.” They allowed a narrative that at times had people saying, “Maybe it is not for me.” A key part of the elevated onboard experience is the message that has become central to the brand which is “no kids onboard.” Saverimuttu notes the growth in the adults-only vacation segment and believes they are ideally positioned in the North American market as the only moderately priced cruise ships offering the adults-only concept. He says the mega ships appealing to everyone with lots of kids and families is good for the market, but people know on Virgin Voyages, it's all adults. He says that permitted them to use spaces on the ships that might have been for children to increase amenities such as fitness and wellness areas, as well as the elevated dining experiences. They promote over 20 included eateries onboard, featuring six sit-down restaurants. Virgin emphasizes that each of its restaurants has its own galley with no central prep galley. Food is cooked to order. It reduces food waste but also presents an enhanced dining experience for the passengers, which they call “sailors.” To Saverimuttu, the one thing that sets the brand apart, and a message you hear repeatedly all around the ship, is the crew. There are 1,160 crewmembers per ship, which each have a passenger capacity of 2,770. He says the number one reason people rebook is the crew and esprit de corps created by treating the crew well, giving them food similar to the passengers, and encouraging them to be natural and individual. Virgin, he says, has a focus on hiring and gives extensive training because it wants its crew to be happy. It is an attitude that comes from Sir Richard Branson, who says Virgin Voyages is among the best companies in the group. Brilliant Lady with the Manhattan skyline (Virgin Voyages) With the introduction of the fourth ship, Virgin Voyages is diversifying its destinations and the length of its cruises, in part in response to the loyal following that wants new things. Brilliant Lady was redesigned, moving the lifeboats inboard among the changes, so it can transit the Panama Canal, and in 2026, will take Virgin to Alaska for the first time. Aboard, changes were made for more seating indoors, more viewpoints, and new elements such as a Spanish restaurant. Unique entertainment was also developed to create variety among the ships. Part of the concept is to offer travelers the opportunity to trade up from other ships, versus the earlier messages that were focused more on the new-to-cruise segment. Most of the other ships without children aboard are the small, ultra-luxury ships, which, with a higher price point, are unattainable for some people, says Saverimuttu. Virgin’s larger ships offer more amenities than smaller ships, such as dining options, and instead of cruise directors, Virgin has a cast to curate a tailored experience for each passenger. For example, one focuses on the arts, another is the “foodie,” and another is health and wellness focused. Saverimuttu says some of the evolution was planned, but some of it was listening and reacting to the customer, and others are trying new things. Richard Branson came up with the idea of the 30-day sea pass, which Saverimuttu admits they were skeptical about at first, but it sold out and is being repeated. Saverimuttu calls it a “learning moment with Richard.” Four years after the brand’s first cruises, they feel like they have moved the narrative to “something for everyone without kids.” The response is strong with bookings up 70 percent for next year and better than 50 percent rebookings. Brilliant Lady sold out for its first revenue cruise after waiting since delivery from Fincantieri at the beginning of 2024 for its first cruise. It heads to Bermuda and New England, before the Caribbean, and in 2026, through the Panama Canal to Mexico, California, and Alaska. She will continue to do what they are calling the “four corners,” while one of the other lady ships (Scarlet Lady, Valiant Lady, and Resilient Lady) will be year-round for the Caribbean, and two will head seasonally to Europe and the Mediterranean. The launch of Virgin Voyages and now retired CEO Tom McAlpin were featured in the January/February 2020 issue of The Maritime Executive.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55
US Issues Stern Warning After “Highly Provocative Move” by Venezuelan Jets,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/us-issues-stern-warning-after-high-provocative-move-by-venezuelan-jets,,05/09/2025 18:51:41,,"The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed in a brief statement that two Venezuelan jets overflew a U.S. warship in international waters in the Caribbean. The U.S. termed it a “highly provocative move,” warning the “cartel running Venezuela” not to interfere with its counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations. CBS News, The New York Times, CNN, Reuters, and others are all reporting that two Venezuelan F-16 jets flew close to a U.S. destroyer in the Caribbean on Thursday. The warship was not identified in the official statement, but off the record, Pentagon sources told the media it was the Arleigh Burke-class Aegis guided missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham. Commissioned in 2010, the vessel is 9,200 tons (displacement) and normally has a complement of 380 aboard. Reuters reports that at least seven U.S. warships have been deployed to the Caribbean carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines. The deployment has drawn criticism from Venezuela and global attention as the Trump administration has vowed to stop drug smuggling. Earlier this year, the administration declared Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua cartel a terrorist organization. Reuters is reporting that 10 U.S. F-35 jets have also been sent to Puerto Rico as part of the ongoing buildup of forces. According to the reports, the two Venezuelan jets flew close to the U.S. warship. USS Jason Dunham did not engage the jets. The Defense statement said, “Today, two Maduro regime military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters. This highly provocative move was designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations. The cartel running Venezuela is strongly advised not to pursue any further effort to obstruct, deter, or interfere ...” The incident came two days after the U.S. military destroyed a speedboat that it said was being used to smuggle drugs. Donald Trump announced the action, saying 11 individuals had been killed in the strike. The administration has asserted that it will continue to pursue these types of strikes to stop drug smuggling. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had told reporters on Wednesday that previous efforts had not stopped the drug smuggling. He said, “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” Earlier on Thursday, before reporting the incident, U.S. Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth defended the actions. He told reporters that the U.S. would continue its activities to stop the threat of illegal narcotics. USS Jason Dunham had been deployed at the start of 2025 as part of the USS Harry S. Truman strike group when they were operating in the Red Sea. The vessel was part of the group when it was repeatedly targeted by the Houthis. The Truman left the region and returned to the United States in June after what the U.S. Navy called one of its “most combat-intensive missions” in decades.",Maritime Executive,06/09/2025 09:26:55

USCG Exercises Austal Option for Offshore Patrol Cutters,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/uscg-exercises-austal-option-for-offshore-patrol-cutters,,06/09/2025 23:28:29,,"Austal Limited announces that the United States Coast Guard has exercised options worth US$314 million (A$480 million) with Austal USA for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) program. The contract options approve Austal to order long lead time materials (LLTM) for another three OPCs, Austal USA’s 4th, 5th, and 6th cutters. Funds have also been provided for logistic supply items for two OPCs. The original OPC contract was awarded to Austal USA in June 2022 for detail design and construction of up to 11 OPCs, with a potential value of US$3.3 billion. To date, two of 11 OPCs in the contract have been awarded to Austal USA, as well as LLTM for a third (see ASX announcement 6 August 2025). “These early awards reflect the strong partnership that has quickly developed between the Coast Guard and Austal USA teams, and provide an important sign of intent for OPCs 3-6,” said Austal CEO Paddy Gregg. Work on Austal USA’s first OPC, Pickering (WMSMS 919), is well underway with the keel laying planned for December. Construction began on Icarus (WMSMS 920) in early August. The 110 metre OPCs will support US national security strategy by maintaining the nation’s economic, social, environmental and military security mission areas. The OPC will typically conduct its primary missions beyond 12 nautical miles from shore and will be employed anywhere US national interests require the Coast Guard’s unique blend of authorities and capabilities. OPC will provide the majority of the Coast Guard’s offshore presence conducting a variety of missions including law enforcement, drug and migrant interdiction, and search and rescue. With a range of 10,200 nautical miles at 14 knots and a 60-day endurance period, each OPC will be capable of deploying independently or as part of task groups, serving as a mobile command and control platform for surge operations such as hurricane response, mass migration incidents and other events. The cutters will also support Arctic objectives by helping regulate and protect emerging commerce and energy exploration in Alaska.",Maritime Executive,07/09/2025 04:42:09
Dominican Navy Commissions 85 Foot Metal Shark Near Coastal Patrol Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/dominican-navy-commissions-85-foot-metal-shark-near-coastal-patrol-vessel,,06/09/2025 21:33:55,,"[By: Metal Shark] The Dominican Navy has received its second 85’ x 19.5’ welded aluminum Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV), built by Louisiana, USA-based boat builder Metal Shark. Christened ARCTURUS CG-114 in keeping with the Dominican tradition of naming military vessels after constellations and celestial bodies, the new patrol craft was built at Metal Shark’s Franklin, Louisiana shipyard and officially incorporated into the Dominican Navy during a ceremony at the Port of Sans Soucí on August 31st. The delivery of ARCTURUS CG-114 follows the delivery of the Dominican Navy’s BETELGEUSE CG-102 in 2020. The vessel was acquired by the Dominican Republic under a $54 million U.S. Navy Foreign Military Sales contract awarded to Metal Shark to produce up to thirteen 85-foot Defiant-class patrol craft for U.S. partner nations in support of regional defense initiatives. ARCTURUS CG-114 is the seventh NCPV to be delivered. The NCPV is a monohull vessel utilizing the parent-craft hull form of Damen Shipyards’ 2606 Standardized Patrol vessel, which has been significantly optimized by Metal Shark to suit the requirements of the NCPV mission. The ARCTURUS CG-114 will strengthen maritime surveillance and control of the Dominican Republic’s jurisdictional waters, expanding its response capacity to combat drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal fishing, and transnational organized crime, while also conducting search and rescue operations at sea. Powered by twin 1,600-horsepower Caterpillar C-32 marine diesel engines turning fixed-pitch Michigan Wheel propellers through Twin Disc MGX-6599 transmissions, the NCPV achieves speeds in excess of 25 knots. The vessel has been designed for missions of up to six days at sea, supporting an operating crew of ten. To maximize versatility, the NCPV carries a 5.6-meter Metal Shark-built aluminum RIB, powered by twin 50-horsepower Mercury four-stroke outboards. The RIB may be quickly deployed and recovered via an integrated stern slipway in support of missions. “Metal Shark is honored to deliver the second Near Coastal Patrol Vessel (NCPV) to the Dominican Republic,” said Henry Irizarry, Senior Vice President of International Business Development at Metal Shark. “This delivery represents a strategic milestone in strengthening the Dominican Navy’s ability to protect its maritime domain, counter illicit trafficking, and ensure regional security. The NCPV reflects Metal Shark’s enduring partnership and commitment to advancing shared defense and security interests, reinforcing the strong ties between our nations as we work together to safeguard critical coastal and economic resources.” “The NCPV program is a testament to Metal Shark’s ability to consistently produce rugged and reliable offshore military platforms designed to meet a complex set of mission requirements and built to rigorous NAVSEA standards,” said Metal Shark CEO Chris Allard. “With multiple NCPVs now patrolling the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Central America and additional units under construction, Metal Shark is proudly supporting those who serve and protect across the entire region.” Metal Shark specializes in the design and construction of welded aluminum vessels from 16’ to over 200’ for military, law enforcement, and commercial operators. Key customers include US and foreign militaries, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and other clients worldwide. With two fully self- contained production facilities and an unmanned systems development facility in Louisiana, USA; a research, design, and testing facility in Alabama, USA; and a dedicated engineering facility in Croatia, Metal Shark’s 400+ employees produce over 200 vessels per year with a proud and proven track record of high quality, on-time deliveries.",Maritime Executive,07/09/2025 04:42:09
NAWE Calls for Expansion of Capital Construction Fund in NDAA,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/nawe-calls-for-expansion-of-capital-construction-fund-in-ndaa,,06/09/2025 21:08:14,,"[By: National Association of Waterfront Employers] The National Association of Waterfront Employers (NAWE) is calling on Congress to include the bipartisan “Strengthening American Maritime Dominance Act” (H.R. 3842) in the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This critical measure would expand the Capital Construction Fund (CCF) to allow U.S. marine terminal operators (MTOs) to upgrade critical cargo handling equipment—modernizing port infrastructure at no cost to taxpayers. With operations at 16 of the 17 U.S. defense strategic seaports, NAWE member companies are vital to the nation’s strategic sealift. Including this proposal in the NDAA will not only modernize critical port infrastructure but also allow the industry to safely and securely transition away from cargo handling equipment produced in China. “Ports and the marine terminal companies that operate at our ports are the backbone of our supply chain and economy. Expanding the CCF will ensure that private marine terminal operators can reinvest in safer, cleaner, and more efficient equipment—strengthening America’s ports, boosting domestic manufacturing, and enhancing national security,” said NAWE President Carl Bentzel. Under the proposed expansion, private MTOs could defer taxes and reinvest those funds into new or replacement cargo handling equipment. The legislation includes strong Buy America provisions and bans the purchase of equipment manufactured in China using CCF funds, ensuring investments support U.S. jobs, industry, and workforce safety. Modernizing port infrastructure is critical to preventing future supply chain disruptions–like those seen during the COVID-19 crisis—and to ensuring a responsive delivery system that sustains U.S. military operations abroad. Allowing private reinvestment through the CCF will stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and support resilient trade operations without additional taxpayer burden. NAWE recently outlined its support for the legislation in a letter to House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee leaders. That letter can be found here.",Maritime Executive,07/09/2025 04:42:09
Höegh Autoliners Names Höegh Moonlight at Port of Gothenburg,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/hoegh-autoliners-names-hoegh-moonlight-at-port-of-gothenburg,,05/09/2025 23:22:01,,"[By: Höegh Autoliners] Höegh Autoliners today celebrated the naming of its sixth Aurora-Class vessel in commercial operation at Sweden’s leading port and the largest in the Nordic region. The vessel was sponsored by Jenny Westermark, Senior Vice President, GTO Production Logistics at Volvo Group, who performed the traditional bottle-breaking. An array of sustainable Volvo Group cargo provided a spectacular showpiece for the proceedings. With a capacity of 9,100 car equivalent units (CEU), the Höegh Moonlight joins Höegh Autoliners’ flagship series of 12 next-generation pure car and truck carriers (PCTCs). The Aurora Class plays a central role in the company's ambition to reach zero emissions by 2040. All are classed by DNV and fly the Norwegian flag. The fifth sister vessel, the Höegh Sunrise, was named at Omaezaki Port in Japan in June this year. CEO of Höegh Autoliners, Andreas Enger, commented: “The naming of Höegh Moonlight demonstrates our strong commitment to decarbonising deep-sea shipping – not in the future, but right now, today. These vessels are not concepts; they are working, sailing answers to one of the most urgent challenges in our industry. I would like to thank Jenny Westermark for graciously sponsoring the vessel.” “The partnership between Höegh Autoliners and Volvo Group is not just a business alliance. It’s a shared commitment – a joint force – to drive real, lasting change in our industries,” Westermark added. SETTING INDUSTRY STANDARD Built for a low-carbon future, the Aurora Class is the most technically advanced and environmentally friendly series of car carriers ever constructed. All 12 vessels are designed from the keel up to transition to clean fuels, with the first eight powered by LNG via dual-fuel engines. They are also “ammonia-ready” with reinforced decks and an integrated tank developed by TGE Marine at the heart of the design, allowing for straightforward conversion to be able to run on clean ammonia in the future. The final four units in the Aurora newbuilding programme, scheduled for delivery from 2027, are dual-fuel vessels able to operate on ammonia from day one. The eight first dual-fuel LNG powered vessels are estimated to deliver 58% lower emissions per transported car compared to the industry average. Höegh Autoliners COO Sebjørn Dahl said: “The Höegh Moonlight reflects the transformation we are leading across the maritime sector. From the speed of delivery to the scale of innovation onboard, these vessels demonstrate what can be achieved when ambition meets action. We are grateful to our partners, crew and global team for making this possible – together, we're building more than vessels, we're helping to shape a cleaner, smarter future for global trade.” Oskar Orstadius, CSO at Höegh Autoliners, added: “The naming of the Höegh Moonlight marks more than the arrival of a vessel; it's a celebration of our close collaboration with key customers and our shared commitment to sustainable, high-quality transport solutions. We are proud to strengthen these partnerships in a port that plays an important role in our global network, and we would also like to express our sincere appreciation to our agent in Sweden, Scandinavian Shipping and Logistics, who has represented Höegh Autoliners with dedication for more than 20 years.” GREEN PORT STRATEGY Port of Gothenburg CEO Göran Eriksson notes that Höegh Autoliners' traffic at the port plays a vital role in enabling Swedish industry to access global markets. ""With the introduction of these new Höegh vessels, that connection can now be made in an even more efficient and climate-smart way than before. The Port of Gothenburg is committed to becoming a leading bunkering hub for alternative fuels in Northern Europe, and Höegh stands as a strong example of a frontrunner showing that our initiatives as a port are moves in the right direction.” By 2030, the port aims to reduce carbon emissions by 70%, at sea, in the terminal areas and on land. The transition is being carried out in close collaboration with industry, policymakers and academia, with a strong focus on creating sustainable value chains for a thriving society and strengthening business access to global markets. Key components of this effort include investments in shoreside power, green shipping corridors, electrification and the fuels of the future, all driven by close cooperation with stakeholders across the entire transport chain.

President Mulino & Japanese Shipowners Meet to Improve Panama Ship Registry,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/president-mulino-japanese-shipowners-meet-to-improve-panama-ship-registry,,05/09/2025 23:08:40,,"[By: Panama Maritime Authority] President José Raúl Mulino met with more than 40 representatives of shipping companies from Japan’s Kanto region, where he presented Panama’s new ship registry strategy aimed at safeguarding its global leadership through enhanced safety standards and fully digitalized processes. Mulino emphasized that Panama’s registry is positioning itself as the flag of the future, driven by new policies aligned with international benchmarks for safety, efficiency, and environmental protection. The stakes are high for Japan: 7 out of 10 Japanese shipowners already fly the Panamanian flag, and 41% of Japan’s total tonnage is registered under Panama. For Panama, consolidating its role as Japan’s preferred registry is vital, as 66% of new shipbuilding comes from the Japanese market. Reflecting on the registry’s long history dating back to the 1920s, Mulino stressed that unlike other registries, Panama’s flag is not a maritime franchise but a national emblem backed by the full weight of the state. He also revealed that his administration is pushing forward a comprehensive modernization plan for the registry, framed within a broader maritime and logistics strategy that integrates the Canal and Panama’s port system. “This plan will bring together our entire maritime cluster under what we now call the National Maritime Strategy—the future of our country,” Mulino declared, pledging to see this project through during his presidency. He underscored his vision of a more flexible Maritime Authority and registry that provides streamlined, user-friendly services. “You can count on Panama’s registry to continue working in favor of the global maritime community, especially Japan,” Mulino told the gathered shipowners. Joining him were Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) Administrator Luis Roquebert and Merchant Marine Director Ramón Franco, both of whom reinforced the president’s message. “Panama has been the world’s natural bridge since ancient times. The creation of our Ship Registry in the early 20th century, alongside the construction of the Canal, positioned the Isthmus as a global benchmark in ship registration—changing the course of maritime history,” Roquebert noted. He highlighted that the PMA has successfully diversified its services, now offering integrated solutions in over 50 countries. “Thanks to our broad network of partners and our expertise, we provide unmatched technical, legal, and diplomatic support,” Roquebert said. For his part, Merchant Marine Director Ramon Franco presented “The Panamanian Ship Registry: Renewing Our Strategy for a New Era,” outlining Panama’s new direction and the competitive advantages it offers. He explained that the Mulino administration’s guiding principle is quality over quantity, focusing on: Franco also underlined Panama’s pioneering role as the first registry to enforce mandatory traceability for ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, part of a strategy to modernize the fleet by gradually phasing out older tonnage and aligning with the IMO’s decarbonization goals for 2050. As of August 25, 2025, Panama’s ship registry includes 8,812 vessels totaling 241.5 million gross tons (GT), according to IHS Markit—representing 14% of the global fleet, based on Clarksons Research’s World Fleet Monitor. Franco reported that the new strategy is already delivering results: fewer accidents and a 13% increase in newbuilding registrations compared to the previous year. He closed by reminding Japanese shipowners that Panama’s registry offers more than just a flag—it comes with the full backing of a country that provides political and economic stability, a robust banking system, special economic zones, investment incentives, world-class logistics hubs, and, of course, the Panama Canal.",Maritime Executive,07/09/2025 04:42:09
Lloyd’s Register Launches Risk-Based Containership Fire Safety Notation,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/lloyd-s-register-launches-risk-based-containership-fire-safety-notation,,05/09/2025 19:54:56,,"[By: Lloyd’s Register] The new notation benefits designers, shipyards, owners, and operators as they plan next-generation container ships or consider retrofits and fleet upgrades. Lloyd’s Register (LR) has launched Fire (C, Risk), a new risk-based notation developed to enhance the assessment of fire safety arrangements on board container ships. The notation is accompanied by guidance to support shipowners, designers, and operators in selecting appropriate, best-practice mitigations based on the specific fire risk profile of a vessel. The new notation, introduced in the July 2025 update to LR’s Rules and Regulations for the Classification of Ships, is the first of its kind to apply the LR ShipRight Risk Based Certification (RBC) methodology to container ship fire safety. This provides a flexible yet robust framework for identifying and validating tailored safety enhancements, from the design phase through to operational deployment. By aligning with the RBC framework, Fire (C, Risk) also supports LR’s broader goals around innovation and assimilation of new technology, digitalisation and data-driven design verification.

Op-Ed: Worried About China's Rise? Beijing's Ambitions are Mostly Regional,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-worried-about-china-s-rise-beijing-s-ambitions-are-regional,,07/09/2025 22:59:25,,"[By Sam Roggeveen] Australia’s former prime minister Tony Abbott wrote in the Wall Street Journal recently that “a world dominated by Beijing would resemble China, with the silencing of dissent, the confiscation of wealth, and the brutal exercise of power.” It’s a dark but plausible vision, given Beijing’s treatment of its minorities, its sometimes-violent repression of dissent, the constant surveillance of its people, and its suppression of free speech. If China ever achieved world domination, it could certainly exercise its power the way Abbott describes. However, what’s left out is a credible account of how China can achieve world domination in the first place. To believe in Abbott’s vision and muster the energy to resist Beijing, we first need to be convinced that there is a realistic path from the world we are in today to the prospect he is warning about. Three other great powers – India, Russia and Japan – live in the same neighborhood as China and have a vital interest in ensuring that Beijing’s ambitions are permanently frustrated. This remains a weak point in the more hawkish assessments about China’s ambitions, a lack of detail about how Beijing gets to world domination. One example (you can find others here) is a warning by Hal Brands from Johns Hopkins University, who argues that China threatens America’s way of government and could encourage its slide into autocracy: If China were someday able to dominate East Asia after American retrenchment, it might gain the power to coerce the United States economically and diplomatically, even if it could never invade militarily. The proliferation of Chinese influence in regions around the world could gradually give Beijing powerful geopolitical and geo-economic advantages, rendering the United States insecure even within its hemispheric fortress. In the meantime, the international economic friction created by protectionism and chaos would drag down American growth, which could exacerbate social and political conflicts at home. And if democracy receded overseas and powerful autocracies advanced, autocratic voices within the United States might be empowered – as indeed happened in the 1930s. Note the “ifs”, “coulds” and “mights” sprinkled throughout this passage – it takes a series of leaps to imagine a world in which China is so powerful that it can undermine American democracy. But note also that Brands acknowledges the unlikelihood of China ever being able to threaten the continental United States with overwhelming military force. The United States is too big, too powerful, and too far away to ever be vulnerable to Chinese invasion. Expansive accounts of Chinese capabilities and intentions are not only light on detail, they also draw attention from more plausible and near-term concerns. As I have written in Foreign Policy this week, the military parade staged in Beijing unveiled new weapons systems that appear mostly to be dedicated to tasks in China’s near abroad rather than for a global military posture. True, the People’s Liberation Army has developed a host of new capabilities to project military power far from home, as Australia discovered in February when a naval flotilla circumnavigated the continent. But the Beijing parade suggests that building a military to rival the United States as a global expeditionary force is far from Beijing’s top priority. Its real focus is to be powerful in the near neighborhood. That’s bad news for Taiwan, and it is compounded by new assessments such as this one, featured in the latest issue of the journal International Security, arguing that the military balance between the United States and China has shifted so markedly in Beijing’s favor that it is becoming difficult to see how Washington could defend Taiwan. It will also make life much more difficult for Southeast Asian countries on China’s periphery. China’s military weight, alongside the attraction of its huge economy, will incentivize the weaker countries of mainland Southeast Asia to preemptively bow to Beijing’s preferences. Indeed, we can already see the makings of a Chinese sphere of influence in Cambodia and Laos. Recent Lowy Institute research shows that China is now the leading partner for both countries in joint military exercises and other kinds of defense diplomacy. Beyond its immediate neighbors, it is difficult to see how China could exercise dominance regionally, let alone globally. And that’s not just because of the United States; indeed, even in a post-American Asia, Chinese dominance seems a long shot. For one thing, China is surrounded by countries with which it has territorial disputes. Furthermore, much of modern Asia is founded on the struggle against colonialism and foreign domination. And finally, three other great powers – India, Russia and Japan – live in the same neighborhood as China and have a vital interest in ensuring that Beijing’s ambitions are permanently frustrated. For all these reasons, it is difficult to see the region meekly acquiescing to Chinese dominance. In an era of receding US primacy in Asia, it is tempting to assume that the pendulum will swing to the other extreme. Real life is likely to be more complicated – and competitive – than that.

Five Dead in Collision Between Migrant Boat and Turkish Coast Guard Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/five-dead-in-collision-between-migrant-boat-and-turkish-coast-guard-vessel,,07/09/2025 22:39:03,,"On Sunday, a migrant vessel collided with a Turkish coast guard vessel at high speed off the coast of Turkey, killing five people and wounding one more. The collision occurred off Ayvalik on Turkey's Aegean coast, near the island of Lesvos. According to the governorate of the Balikesir region, there were 34 people aboard the boat, including the operator, and all aboard went into the water. Five bodies were recovered during the ensuing search and rescue mission, and one injured individual was taken to a hospital for treatment. The Turkish Coast Guard periodically rescues or interdicts migrants off the coast of Ayvalik, which is just eight nautical miles (at the narrowest point) from Greek soil, where migrants have access to EU asylum claim opportunities. In December, the Turkish Coast Guard rescued 57 irregular migrants in four inflatable boats in the area; in that instance, the survivors alleged that they had been pushed across the boundary line by the Hellenic Coast Guard, a sensitive contention often raised by human rights NGOs and hotly disputed by Greece. Migration on the Aegean route is less intensive than it once was, but it remains risky for those who take it. According to the Daily Sabah, two migrants were found dead last week on the beaches of Rhodes, opposite the Turkish port of Marmaris and another popular destination for migrants seeking a better life.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 04:41:59
Freighter Goes Aground in Northwest Passage,https://maritime-executive.com/article/freighter-goes-aground-in-northwest-passage,,07/09/2025 22:12:35,,"A freighter has gone aground in the remote reaches of Canada's Northwest Passage, at a location in the southern half of the Central Canadian Archipelago. According to local outlet Cabin Radio, the freighter Thamesborg was en route from China to Quebec when it grounded in Franklin Strait, just southeast of Prince of Wales Island. The central section of the Northwest Passage has two options - a northern route, often blocked by ice, and a southern route, which passes between Victoria Island and the mainland. Franklin Strait is one of the options for accessing this route. At 800 miles northeast of Yellowknife, Franklin Passage is exceptionally remote. A grounding in the distant waters of the Northwest Passage has been among the top concerns of Canadian SAR planners for years. Luckily, the operator of the Thamesborg reports that there has been no pollution due to the grounding, and the crew are all safe, according to Cabin Radio. AIS data provided by Pole Star Global shows that Thamesborg is aground on a shallow pinnacle on the southwest side of the strait. She is accompanied by two Canadian Coast Guard vessels, an unnamed CCG patrol vessel and the icebreaking buoy tender Sir Wilfred Laurier. Though intermittent cloud cover makes analysis difficult, satellite data from JPSS / RAMBB appears to show no ice in the area of the grounding. The Northwest Passage is known for the twin risks of shallow water and ice, and is prone to clogging with drifting floes even during the short shipping season. Many transits (including modern cruises) are done in smaller, shallower-draft vessels. The largest vessel ever to transit the passage was the 1969 voyage of the 115,000 dwt tanker SS Manhattan, with extensive icebreaker support. The vessel made the transit in ballast both ways, at less than her full laden draft of 52 feet. The effort was not successfully repeated due to ice.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 04:41:59
Venezuela Deploys Iranian Missile Boats to Fend Off U.S. Navy,https://maritime-executive.com/article/venezuela-deploys-iranian-missile-boats-to-fend-off-u-s-navy,,07/09/2025 19:44:50,,"In response to a concentration in the southern Caribbean of a substantial US Navy force, the Venezuelan Navy has reportedly deployed some of the Peykaap III Fast Attack Craft that Iran supplied it with several years ago. The Venezuela Navy deployed Iranian-built Peykaap-III (Zolfaghar-class) fast attack craft equipped with CM-90 Anti-Ship Missiles (ASCM) supplied by Iran. pic.twitter.com/vc2aiSIKxI One of three Venezuelan Peykaap Fast Attack Craft seen on the dockside at the Agustín Armario Naval Base in Puerto Cabello (https://x.com/i/status/1964133901049221184) In April 2021, the Iranian Navy (Nedaja) logistics vessel IRINS Makran (K441) left Bandar Abbas, escorted by the Moudge Class frigate IRINS Sarhand (F74). Iranian official sources suggested that the flotilla was heading for Venezuela. Clearly visible on the deck of IRINS Makran as she left port were seven Peykaap fast patrol craft, a North Korean-derived type with a crew of three normally operated by the IRGC Navy where it is known sometimes as the Zolfaghar. The flotilla rounded the Cape of Good Hope but was then spotted by the Danish Navy with the Peykaap fast patrol craft still on deck, en route to the Russian Navy 325th anniversary in St. Petersburg. It was not clear whether the Makran returned to Bandar Abbas with the Peykaaps still on board. But at some point, the boats were delivered to Venezuela, because the boats were on show during a naval parade in Venezuela in July 2023.

The export version of the Nasr-1 is known as the CM-90. The system has a range of 90 kilometers. Hezbollah used Nasr-1 to attack the Beit Lid military base in northern Israel on October 17, 2024. The Khowsar shorter-range missile from the same Eagle Strike missile family, known in Chinese service as the C-701, was used by Hezbollah to attack INS Hanit (503) off Lebanon in July 2006. Both Khowsar and Nasr-1s can be fired from the same missile boxes. Surprisingly, neither of these two types of missiles have yet been identified in use by the Houthis. The Nasr-1/CM-90 is unlikely to pose a significant threat to US Navy warships, which will nonetheless need to be at general quarters when in zone. The Arleigh Burke-class Aegis guided missile destroyer USS Jason Dunham (DDG-109) and its sister ships have overlapping anti-missile systems, such as Sea Sparrow and Phalanx, to deal with both medium and close-range anti-missile systems. However, the US naval force commander will have other options for neutralizing the threat well before the Peykaaps could get within Nasr-1 range. The Venezuelans have more potent weaponry available in the form of 100-kilometer range Kh-31A (AS-17 Krypton) anti-ship missiles; these can be fired from Venezuela’s remaining Su-30MK2V Flanker fighters, from a batch of 24 delivered by Russia in 2008.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 04:41:59
Op-Ed: It's Time to Invite Taiwan to America's Biggest Naval Exercise,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-it-s-time-to-invite-taiwan-to-america-s-biggest-naval-exercise,,07/09/2025 17:26:15,,"[By Jim Halsell] The Taiwan Strait remains one of the most volatile flashpoints in the world. With the People’s Republic of China (PRC) accelerating its coercive behavior aimed at “reunifying” Taiwan with the mainland, the United States must adopt a clearer, more deliberate strategy to bolster deterrence and reassure regional partners. One measure that should be taken is to include Taiwan in the world’s largest multinational maritime exercise – the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC). Doing so would be consistent with U.S. policy under the Taiwan Relations Act, align with the values of collective defense and democratic solidarity, and signal to Beijing that any use of military force against Taiwan will result in a unified, multinational response. Taiwan’s Strategic Significance Taiwan occupies a central position in the First Island Chain and plays a crucial role in the balance of power in East Asia. It is a thriving democratic society of 23.4 million people and a key node in global semiconductor supply chains. Beijing’s claim to the island is tenuous, supported by a campaign of intimidation and “gray zone” tactics that aim to coerce Taiwan into capitulation without war. Though lacking official recognition as an independent country by the United States and many of its allies, Taiwan is not isolated. U.S. policy, as codified in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), commits the United States to make available “defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,” and to “maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security” of the people of Taiwan. Inclusion in RIMPAC would help operationalize this policy while remaining consistent with the U.S. One China policy. Why Include Taiwan? Deterrence requires both capability and credibility. While Taiwan continues to acquire U.S. military hardware and reform its defense posture, the question of whether the United States and its allies would support Taiwan in a contingency remains deliberately ambiguous. Strategic ambiguity may help manage escalation risk, but it risks failing to deter if Beijing concludes that the costs of aggression are tolerable. Involving Taiwan in RIMPAC would signal a broader multinational investment in regional peace. Beijing is pursuing two parallel lines of effort to pressure Taiwan: coercion without violence and the looming threat of military force. Both avenues can be countered through stronger integration with partners, transparent signaling, and public commitments to Taiwan’s survival as a free society. The inclusion of Taiwan in RIMPAC would not require diplomatic recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state. RIMPAC has previously included diverse participants with some participating only as observers. Taiwan could be invited under a similar framework—e.g., “Taipei Navy—Observer”—that would align with RIMPAC precedent, and would not constitute formal U.S. recognition. It would, however, reinforce the deterrent message that a conflict in the Taiwan Strait would not remain a bilateral issue between Washington and Beijing. Reinforcing the Taiwan Relations Act The TRA provides a clear legislative foundation for actions that enhance Taiwan’s defense and deter coercion. The Act affirms that “the United States will consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means...a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” Participation in exercises like RIMPAC would help Taiwan prepare for defense without crossing the line into formal alliance, thereby avoiding a breach of the One China policy. Congress continues to reaffirm bipartisan support for Taiwan’s self-defense. The FY2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes provisions to strengthen military cooperation and enhance deterrence through initiatives like the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative. Including Taiwan in exercises alongside Japan, Australia, and other regional partners would be a natural extension of these legislative efforts. Operational and Symbolic Value Beyond signaling, there are tangible military benefits. Taiwan’s military operates U.S.-made systems and is transitioning toward an asymmetric defense model, emphasizing survivability and denial. Interoperability with U.S. and allied forces, especially in joint maritime operations, will be essential in any scenario short of or including conflict. As the Council on Foreign Relations notes, “Taiwan likely doesn’t have the capabilities to defend against a Chinese attack without external support,” despite pledging nearly $20 billion in defense spending for 2025. Enhancing operational coordination before a crisis emerges is not only prudent, but operationally essential. Symbolically, inclusion in RIMPAC would acknowledge the democratic values that Taiwan shares with other regional partners. This is particularly important as Taiwan remains diplomatically isolated, with only eleven countries maintaining official relations. Participation in multinational military activities would help offset this isolation without provoking conflict, provided it is managed diplomatically and clearly communicated. Would Other Nations Support Taiwan’s Inclusion in RIMPAC? One of the central concerns surrounding Taiwan’s potential inclusion in RIMPAC is whether key U.S. allies and regional partners would support such a move or whether they would balk at the political risk of antagonizing the People’s Republic of China. However, recent geopolitical trends suggest that support for Taiwan’s participation in multinational defense activities is quietly growing, particularly among Indo-Pacific democracies that share an interest in preserving regional stability and resisting Chinese coercion. Japan is perhaps the most likely partner to welcome Taiwan’s inclusion. Tokyo has become increasingly vocal about the importance of Taiwan to Japan’s national security, with senior officials, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, stating that “a Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency.” Japan’s Self-Defense Forces have increased coordination with the U.S. military and have participated in bilateral and trilateral exercises that implicitly prepare for scenarios involving Taiwan. Given Japan’s growing anxiety over China’s assertiveness and its own constitutional reinterpretation on collective self-defense, Tokyo would likely support Taiwan’s inclusion in a multilateral setting like RIMPAC, especially if coordinated in advance with careful diplomatic messaging. Australia has also strengthened its strategic alignment with the United States and Japan, particularly through the AUKUS agreement. Canberra has voiced concerns about China’s regional behavior and recently joined Washington in emphasizing the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. While Australia might be more cautious about formal diplomatic gestures, it is unlikely to oppose Taiwan’s participation in a non-sovereign capacity, especially if framed as a security-enhancing measure rather than a political endorsement. Other Indo-Pacific states, such as India, Philippines, and Vietnam, have growing interests in counterbalancing Chinese maritime assertiveness. India has long advocated for a multipolar Asia and may view Taiwan’s inclusion as consistent with its own efforts to build regional coalitions. The Philippines, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has deepened security ties with the United States and allowed expanded access to military bases in response to PRC aggression in the South China Sea. Vietnam, while traditionally wary of foreign alignments, has clashed with China over maritime claims and may be open to Taiwan’s inclusion in an observer or limited functional role. European states that have participated in recent RIMPAC iterations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have also increasingly signaled concern over Taiwan’s security. They conducted transits of the Taiwan Strait, and their defense white papers mention the Indo-Pacific as a zone of strategic interest. While these countries may not be vocal advocates for Taiwan’s inclusion, they would be unlikely to withdraw or protest if the decision were led by the United States with appropriate multilateral coordination. Ultimately, the determining factor may be how the invitation is framed. If Taiwan’s participation is defined not as a sovereign equal to other states but rather as a security partner or “participant entity,” other nations could find it diplomatically palatable. This would mirror Taiwan’s existing participation in multilateral forums such as the Olympics, the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where it joins under the name “Chinese Taipei.” RIMPAC’s Flexible Participation Model RIMPAC’s long history as a multinational exercise underscores its diplomatic flexibility. Since its inception in 1971, RIMPAC has included a diverse array of participants, including states with varying degrees of political alignment with the United States, non-ally partners, and even, at times, strategic competitors. This precedent offers a viable pathway for Taiwan’s inclusion without triggering a fundamental break in U.S. policy or alienating key participants. A notable example is the People’s Republic of China, which was invited to participate in RIMPAC in both 2014 and 2016. Despite growing tensions in the South China Sea and concerns about Chinese military transparency, the Obama administration included the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) in an effort to promote professional military dialogue and reduce the risk of miscalculation. China sent surface combatants, auxiliary vessels, and observers to participate in non-combat aspects of the exercise. This inclusion was reversed in 2018 following the continued militarization of artificial features in the South China Sea, but the precedent remains: even states that do not share U.S. values or alliance structures have participated in RIMPAC under constrained formats. Similarly, RIMPAC has welcomed non-allied or non-aligned states such as Vietnam, India, and Brunei, each of which participated in observer or limited operational capacities. These arrangements allowed for diplomatic inclusivity without compromising the exercise’s core focus on interoperability and security cooperation. India was first invited as an observer in the early 2000s before gradually expanding its participation, culminating in the deployment of naval assets by the 2010s. This incremental approach demonstrates RIMPAC’s capacity to accommodate partners with unique diplomatic statuses or sensitivities. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), established under the Taiwan Relations Act as the vehicle for unofficial U.S.-Taiwan relations, could serve as the conduit for managing Taiwan’s RIMPAC participation. AIT-coordinated representation would allow the United States to maintain consistency with its One China policy while exercising its commitment to Taiwan’s self-defense. Managing PRC Backlash Inevitably, Beijing would likely respond harshly to Taiwan’s inclusion in RIMPAC, as it has to other perceived infringements on its sovereignty claims. Large-scale military drills, economic sanctions, diplomatic condemnation, and cyber operations are all part of the PRC’s well-established retaliation playbook. Yet the United States and its partners must resist the temptation to let their Taiwan policy be dictated by fears of PRC outrage. This reactive posture grants Beijing a de facto veto over democratic decision-making and emboldens further coercion. China has escalated its pressure campaign on Taiwan even in the absence of provocations. Since the election of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, Beijing has employed what Richard Bush calls “coercion without violence,” a deliberate campaign to wear down Taiwan psychologically, politically, and economically without firing a shot.3 This has included near-daily air and naval incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), cyberattacks on government agencies, diplomatic isolation, and targeted disinformation campaigns. These actions have continued even as Taiwan’s leadership has treaded cautiously. President Tsai’s tenure was marked by efforts to maintain the cross-Strait status quo and avoid unilateral declarations of independence. Her successor, President Lai Ching-te, has pledged to do the same, calling for “dialogue instead of confrontation” in his 2024 inauguration address. Nevertheless, Beijing has continued to characterize Lai as a “separatist” and launched punitive military exercises following both his inauguration and Taiwan’s National Day celebrations. This pattern reveals a key truth: Beijing’s escalatory behavior is not a response to specific actions by Taipei or Washington, but part of a long-term strategy to bring Taiwan under PRC control. As such, restraint has not yielded peace; resolve may. Integrating Taiwan into multinational military exercises like RIMPAC would impose reputational and strategic costs on Beijing’s aggression by signaling that Taiwan’s security is a shared interest among responsible stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, deterrence fails when adversaries perceive inaction as weakness. Taiwan’s participation in multinational exercises is not merely symbolic. It is a necessary step to ensure that coercion is met with collective resolve. The message to Beijing must be unmistakable: the democratic world will not stand by while one of its own is bullied into submission. It is time for the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies to move from passive deterrence to active deterrence. The inclusion of Taiwan in RIMPAC would send an unmistakable message to Beijing: any aggression against Taiwan risks triggering a multilateral response from a network of regional powers united by shared values and interests. Including Taiwan in RIMPAC would fulfill the spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, enhance deterrence, and stand as a visible affirmation of America’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.

Canada to Boost Ship Recycling Capacity on the West Coast,https://maritime-executive.com/article/canada-to-boost-ship-recycling-capacity-on-the-west-coast,,08/09/2025 02:54:45,,"Canada is working to increase its ship recycling capacity on the West Coast in order to accommodate an influx of end-of-life vessels in the near future. The Royal Canadian Navy is expected to retire several of its warships starting this fall. B.C. Ferries has also announced a major fleet renewal effort, which will see the company retire some of its older vessels. In July, B.C. Ferries said that it is looking to have its vessels recycled in British Columbia. Owing to this rising demand, Gord Johns, the MP (member of parliament) for the Courtenay-Alberni area in British Columbia, is eyeing the deep-sea port of Alberni as a suitable location to establish a green ship recycling facility. “The Alberni Valley is uniquely positioned to attract the infrastructure and business investment needed for ship recycling and dry dock facilities,” said Johns. “With federal nation-building investments on the horizon, increased defense spending, and growing demand for world-class vessel recycling, the timing could not be more critical.” To spearhead the ship recycling operation in Port Alberni, politicians in central Vancouver Island have formed a leadership group to collect inputs from local people. Some of the targeted stakeholders include First Nations, Transport Canada, local businesses and unions as well as environmental organizations. In addition, the leadership group will look into the financing aspects of the project. The group met for the first time on Friday. “We need a strong regulatory environment to keep this type of industry on our coast,” said Josie Osborne, member of legislative assembly for Mid Island-Pacific Rim.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 09:32:19
"80 Years After WWII Ended, a Deadly Legacy Remains in the Pacific",https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/80-years-after-wwii-ended-a-deadly-legacy-remains-in-the-pacific,,08/09/2025 01:17:00,,"[By Stacey Pizzino and Bryan G. Fry] On September 2, 1945, the second world war ended when Japan officially surrendered. Today, on the 80th anniversary, the physical legacy of the conflict remains etched into land and sea. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Pacific. There, fierce battles left behind sunken warships, aircraft and unexploded bombs. These remnants are not only historical artifacts but toxic time capsules. They leak fuel, heavy metals and other hazardous substances into fragile ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and, potentially, human health. This problem is a reminder of the enduring environmental harms of conflict. Toxic remnants of war can damage ecosystems and communities long after the fighting stops. The USS Astoria steams by USS Yorktown after the carrier was hit by three Japanese bombs in the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942 (US Navy) The Pacific as a dumping ground World War II in the Pacific involved four years of conflict between Japan and Allied forces. The war began in the region in December 1941 when Japan attacked a United States naval base at Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. The Pacific conflict included the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway and the Guadalcanal campaign in the Solomon Islands. Pacific islands became staging grounds for battles. Weapons were stockpiled and hazardous material discarded. Ships and aircraft were sunk. When the war ended, much of this material was simply left behind. Among the remains are an estimated 3,800 wrecks still lying on the Pacific Ocean floor. An environmental hazard As remnants of war degrade, they often leach toxic pollutants into nearby waters and soils. These can build up in marine life, enter the food chain and pose serious risks to both biodiversity. At Palau, a WWII Japanese ship sank in Koror Harbour and became known as the Helmet Wreck. It contains Japanese depth charges leaking acid into surrounding waters. Researchers have shown the long-term environmental impacts in the Baltic Sea of unexploded WWII ordnance – bombs, shells and grenades that failed to detonate. An estimated 3000kg of dissolved ammunition chemicals have been found. Coral reefs and mangroves, which are vital for coastal protection, are especially vulnerable to both chemical exposure and physical damage. For example, researchers examined the effects off Puerto Rico of unexploded ordnance. They found nearby sea animals contained potentially toxic compounds leaking from the ordnance, which meant the substances had entered the food web. Remnants of war, such as this unexploded ordnance on a beach in the Solomon Islands, can pollute the surrounding area. Chris Teasdale, Author provided (no reuse) Human communities on high alert Unexploded ordnance continues to endanger communities. Just last year, for example, more than 200 bombs were found buried beneath a school in the Solomon Islands. In places such as Palau, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, these dangers are unearthed regularly. They can be found by farmers working their land, children playing or fisherman working. Buried bombs, sunken ships and downed aircraft often contain fuel and heavy metals. This includes lead and cadmium which can interfere with the body’s hormone system and cause serious health issues. Research into the human health impacts of war remains is limited – especially in the Pacific. But existing studies suggest exposure is linked to serious consequences. For example, parental exposure to wartime contaminants has been linked to birth defects in Gaza and Vietnam. And a study of Britsh Army ammunition technicians released earlier this year found significantly higher rates of bladder cancer than the general population. This suggests occupational exposure to explosive compounds may pose long-term health risks. Climate change is increasing the risk As Earth’s climate warms, extreme weather events are worsening and seas are rising. This is exacerbating the dangers posed by wartime remnants. For example Cyclone Pam, in March 2015, exposed unexploded WWII ordnance in Kiribati and Tuvalu. Further investigations revealed remnants including high explosive projectiles, mortars and 5,300 rounds of ammunition. In 2020, a visiting fisherman found an unexploded bomb near Lord Howe Island. Then-Environment Minister Sussan Ley suggested the device may have been shifted by a cyclone or ocean currents. Similarly, floods and landslides can move these hazards over significant distances, increasing uncertainty around their locations and complicating clearance efforts. Rising sea levels are threatening to breach one of the Pacific’s most toxic legacies – the Runit Dome in the Marshall Islands. This concrete structure was built in the late 1970s to contain radioactive waste from US nuclear testing decades earlier. Research shows extreme storms could increase radioactive sediments in the area to up to 84 times higher than normal. There are also concerns cracks in the dome’s surface could lead to contamination of surrounding waters. In this 1978 photo from Runit Island, military personnel in protective clothing watch as concrete and soil is used to cover up a crater left by the US after it conducted nuclear tests decades earlier. Department of Defense/US Army Reflecting on war’s toxic legacy Despite the risks to people and health in the Pacific, remediation has been slow. The 80th anniversary of WWII offers an opportunity to reflect on the toxic legacy of war – and to act. The scale of the problem demands coordinated, well-funded action. The work should not just remove dangerous materials, but restore damaged ecosystems and monitor long-term health impacts. Some support has been offered. It includes Operation Render Safe, a program to remove war remnants led by the Australian Defence Force. But more is needed. Regional partners – including Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the United States – have a chance to lead. This means investing in environmental cleanup, supporting affected communities and acknowledging historical responsibility. It also means listening to Pacific voices, who have long called for greater attention to the war’s toxic legacy. Their knowledge, resilience and lived experience must be central to any response.

G20 Summit Forces S. Africa to Cancel Naval Drills with China and Russia,https://maritime-executive.com/article/g20-summit-forces-s-africa-to-cancel-naval-drills-with-china-and-russia,,08/09/2025 01:08:00,,"Last week, South Africa announced postponing a key naval exercise with China and Russia slated for November. This has been interpreted as a move to avoid the exercise coinciding with the G20 summit, scheduled in South Africa in the same month. U.S. Vice President JD Vance is expected to attend the summit. In the past few months, South Africa has been in the crosshairs of U.S. President Trump, stemming from policy differences. Last month, South African exports to the U.S. were slapped with a 30% tariff rate. South Africa's Department of Defense explained that the decision to postpone the exercise was in view of the activities related to South Africa’s G20 Presidency. “The postponement is to ensure that the exercises do not impact on the logistical, security and other arrangements associated with South Africa’s G20 Presidency,” said Siphiwe Dlamini, DoD Head of Communication. South Africa took over G20 leadership in December last year and will be handing over to U.S. in November. According to some defense analysts, it would have been baffling for South Africa to host a trilateral naval exercise with China and Russia alongside the G20 summit. The exercise (EX MOSI) is in third iteration and takes place every two years between the BRICS partners. South Africa said new dates for the postponed exercise will be announced, without mentioning specific timelines. This year, the exercise was planned off South African waters in the Western Cape. While BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) alliance has focused on economic cooperation, the scope appears to be expanding to include defense. Last week, a briefing meeting for a proposed BRICS combined maritime exercise was held in Cape Town, South Africa. The meeting brought together military leaders from BRICS partner countries, including Iran. Speaking to the press after the meeting, Captain Hassan Maghsoodloo, Commander of the First Naval District of Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, confirmed his combat naval units are likely to participate in the drill. South Africa maintains that military exercises are an opportunity to strengthen its multilateral and bilateral relations. In the past few years, South Africa has participated in joint military exercises with countries such as Brazil, Germany, China and France. However, South Africa and the U.S. last month agreed to cancel the Shared Accord military exercise, which was planned in Free State province. “Unfortunately, South Africa’s Ministry of Defense and Veterans presented requirements deemed inconsistent with the agreements between our governments that U.S. DoD could not support,” said a diplomatic note from the U.S. Embassy in South Africa.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 09:32:19

While the region hosts several international naval task forces including EUNAVFOR Atalanta and the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), participation of the regional navies has been limited. Currently, the existing regional naval cooperation framework is under the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), an intergovernmental body based in Mauritius and representing interests of five western Indian Ocean island countries. Under the IOC’s maritime security framework, there are two regional centers, which have helped coordinate regional responses to maritime threats in the Western Indian Ocean. The first one is the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Center (RMIFC) based in Madagascar. The other one is the Regional Coordination of Operations Center (RCOC) in Seychelles. With the new working group, DCOC/JA hopes to scale the operations of these centers. “Remember that the countries served by the IOC regional centers are also members of the DCoC/JA. Therefore, the new working group will expand the mandate and allow for bigger operations extending to southern Red Sea,” said Kiruja Micheni, DCoC/JA Project Manager. In addition, Kiruja noted that the international navies operating in the region are unable to prosecute suspects engaging in illegal maritime activities. For this reason, the enhanced regional approach seeks to have a legal finish for maritime crimes. Besides, the efforts of the international navies can only go so far without synergies with the regional partners in the Western Indian Ocean. Following the successful launch of the working group, Kenya and South Africa offered to lead fundraising efforts at the IMO (International Maritime Organization). The working group is scheduled to start holding regional naval exercises in the next three years. This regional initiative comes at a time when maritime threats in the Western Indian Ocean are rising. It is almost 700 days into the ongoing Red Sea crisis, and arms trafficking has been reported to be on the rise in waters in the Gulf of Aden. Early this year, security agencies confirmed strengthening of relations between Al-Shabaab militia group in Somalia and Houthis in Yemen. If left unchecked, this has potential to further destabilize merchant shipping in the region. So far, the U.S Africa Command (AFRICOM) has conducted dozens of airstrikes in Somalia, mainly targeting the hideouts of ISIS-Somalia fighters in the Puntland region.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 15:43:25

Subsea Cable Cuts in Red Sea Increase Data Delays,https://maritime-executive.com/article/subsea-cable-cuts-in-red-sea-increase-data-delays,,08/09/2025 01:58:40,,"On Saturday, Microsoft confirmed that undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea may have increased delays for customers of its Azure cloud platform. Users with data passing through the Mideast - whether locally, in Asia or in Europe - temporarily experienced higher latency. In an update Sunday, the company said that the issues were resolved, and that its team was working to manage the effects of the situation by rerouting traffic through other channels. It cautioned that permanent repairs to the subsea links could be longer in coming. ""Undersea fiber cuts can take time to repair, as such we will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing,"" the software giant said. Internet traffic monitor NetBlocks reported that the disruption was located in the Red Sea, and the Pakistan Telecommunication Company narrowed the location to waters off the coast of Jeddah - roughly 400 nautical miles northwest of Houthi-controlled areas of western Yemen, the region of highest maritime security concern in the Red Sea. Accidental cable cuts happen routinely around the world, and private-sector commercial cable repair companies run a steady business dispatching cable ships to make repairs. The cuts attract more attention when they occur in areas of high geopolitical tension. Repeated cuts in the Taiwan Strait and the Baltic have resulted in vessel arrests and criminal charges for ship captains who are suspected of severing lines with their anchors - but proving intentional sabotage is difficult when the act of cutting a cable also occurs by accident, with frequency. The most recent cable damage incident in the Red Sea occurred in early 2024. Three cables were severed in February 2024, likely cut by the dragging anchor of the stricken bulker Rubymar. The ship drifted for weeks - abandoned and unassisted - after Houthi fighters hit it with an antiship missile. 90 percent of all international data traffic passes through subsea cables, and they are essential to the smooth functioning of commerce. That makes them a tempting target for saboteurs and spies: the cables are remote, difficult to monitor, and largely unprotected, especially in deep waters where they lie unburied on the bottom. Multiple nation-states are known to possess sophisticated capabilities for tampering with, cutting or destroying subsea cables - but in shallower waters, a dragged anchor is all that is needed.",Maritime Executive,08/09/2025 15:43:25

Op-Ed: Insurers Must Play a Role in Eradicating Sexual Misconduct at Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-insurers-must-play-a-role-in-eradicating-sexual-misconduct-at-sea,,09/09/2025 03:09:00,,"Marine insurers must take an active role in eradicating sexual misconduct at sea, delegates at the International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI) annual conference in Singapore heard today. Moderating the Legal & Liability Workshop, Charles Fernandez, Chair of the IUMI Legal & Liability Committee, called on the marine insurance sector to recognise its responsibility in combating this serious issue. Women represent just 1% of the global seafaring workforce but a shocking 25% of women in maritime report having experienced physical or sexual assault. “Sadly, almost all women in maritime have experienced some form of sexual misconduct at sea, ranging from unconscious bias to full-scale assault,” said Fernandez. “Sexual misconduct in any form is completely unacceptable and must be stopped. Our workshop highlighted a number of recent cases and served to bring this appalling practice to the consciousness of the marine insurance community.” Fernandez emphasised that while marine insurers are not directly involved in vessel operations, they are a crucial part of the maritime supply chain and must use their influence to raise awareness and drive change. “Marine insurers have a responsibility to do all they can to raise awareness of sexual misconduct at sea and to join the effort to eradicate it completely,” he stated. The workshop heard that many offences go unreported. Some women fear damage to their reputation, career progression, or simply believe their claims would not be taken seriously. Further complicating the issue is the fragmented legal landscape. In some cases, the law applied depends on the flag state of the vessel. In others, jurisdiction falls to the country or location where the harm was suffered. This inconsistency can make pursuing justice complex and intimidating for victims. In most cases of sexual misconduct, shipowners could be held directly liable - particularly if there is evidence they were aware of a perpetrator’s previous history. Shipowners have a legal obligation to provide a safe working environment. Several high-profile cases have recently come to light where victims have secured successful outcomes, resulting in significant compensation claims paid by liability insurers. “Joining with others to prevent sexual misconduct at sea is not just the right thing to do, it is also a risk mitigation strategy,” Fernandez explained. “A number of recent cases have resulted, quite rightly, in large payouts for victims with claims being paid by insurers. As marine underwriters, we must be aware of the issue and do what we can to ensure our assureds are implementing effective safeguards and strategies to eradicate all forms of sexual misconduct.” The International Union of Marine Insurance e.V. (IUMI) is a non-profit association established for the purpose of protecting, safeguarding and advancing insurers‘ interests in marine and all types of transport insurance.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
WSC Warns 11 Percent of Containers Have Safety Issues,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wsc-warns-11-percent-of-containers-have-safety-issues,,09/09/2025 01:53:00,,"The issues of mis-declared or improperly packed cargo in containers are again being highlighted in new data from the World Shipping Council. The trade group reports based on port state inspection data that the number of containers found with potential safety issues has risen to more than 11 percent, which extrapolates to approximately 27.5 million containers annually based on an estimate that the industry transports 250 million boxes a year. “With over one-in-ten shipments showing deficiencies, the message is clear: gaps in cargo safety remain far too common,” said Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council. “Cargo deficiencies put crews, ships, cargo, and the environment at risk."" The council highlights that, by law, port state inspectors can check containers to ensure cargo complies with international regulations and standards. They are looking at issues such as proper declarations and packing of dangerous goods. The data shows that 11.39 percent of containers were found with deficiencies, up from 11 percent in 2023. Between 2017 and 2022, the rate had been under 9 percent a year and fallen as low as 6.5 percent in 2019, but also jumped to 10.86 percent in 2021. The types of issues that are being identified include mis-declared and undeclared dangerous goods, incorrect documentation, and improper packing, all of which the World Shipping Council points out can lead to serious safety incidents, including ship fires. While the causes have not been identified, the industry has suffered several high-profile incidents recently. In June, the Wan Hai 503 with a capacity of over 1,700 containers reported a fire that burned for weeks and devastated the vessel, while last month, Maersk reported a fire aboard one of its largest container ships, Marie Maersk (19,076 TEU). While firefighting teams were able to stop the spread of the fire and limit damage, Maersk recently declared General Average for the vessel, which is due to reach the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia next week. Cargo owners will be required to share the cost of the firefighting effort. The shipping industry has been working to address the issue, including new regulations, for example, on the shipment of charcoal. However, while it has been successful in reducing containers lost overboard (just 576 in 2024 according to World Shipping Council data), the dangers from mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo remain high. The WSC is calling for strong safety measures and more reporting. It notes that currently, just seven port states are reporting cargo safety data. The 2024 report is based on information from 77,688 containers inspected, where 8,850 were found to have deficiencies. More data, the WSC says, would highlight trends and provide insights to address the problem.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
MOL Develops Innovative Designs for Wind-Assisted LNG Carriers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mol-develops-innovative-designs-for-wind-assisted-lng-carriers,,09/09/2025 00:45:34,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines continues to work to advance wind-assisted propulsion, building on the concepts after deploying its first rigid, retractable sail on a bulk carrier in October 2022. The company has previously committed to installing its “Wind Challenger” on 25 vessels by 2030 and 80 vessels by 2035. Working with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries, and Lloyd’s Register as the classification society, they developed innovative concepts for an LNG carrier that could achieve, they project, up to 30 percent fuel saving per voyage and 15 to 20 percent annually. The company previously released a design developed with Hanwha Ocean for a conventional LNG carrier with wind sails, but now has completed preliminary designs for an innovative vessel with four of the rigid sails. A key element of the two designs moves the bridge toward the bow of the vessel to enable the increase from two to four rigid sails that would rise to a maximum height of approximately 160 feet (48 meters) in a three-tier design. It permits the design to optimize the placement of the sails and maximize the fuel efficiency gains. The ships would be between 938 feet (287 meters) and 951 feet (290 meters) in length, and each has a capacity of 174,000 cbm. The Wind Challenger, a rigid sail system capable of automatic extension, retraction, and rotation. The first installation was on a 100,000 dwt coal carrier, Shofu Maru, and MOL reported it was able to reduce daily fuel consumption by up to 17 percent, equating to 5 to 8 percent per voyage on average on its first seven roundtrips to Japan from Australia, Indonesia, and North America. A second vessel was fitted with the sail, to be followed by nine additional vessels. The sail is made of fiber-reinforced plastic. MOL reports that comprehensive risk assessments were undertaken for the new designs in collaboration with the shipyards, the classification society, and flag states. The assessments covered the sail arrangement, visibility impact, emergency operation procedures, and other safety measures. In addition, safety evaluations were conducted in collaboration with the respective flag states. The new vessel design developed with HD Hyundai Heavy Industries earned AiP from the Marshall Islands, while the vessel design jointly developed with Samsung Heavy Industries received AiP from Liberia. Having been awarded the AiP for the two designs, MOL reports detailed sign work for actual construction is currently underway.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
U.S. Navy Retools its Unmanned Programs for Speed,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-navy-retools-its-unmanned-programs-for-speed,,09/09/2025 00:36:06,,"The U.S. Navy continues to restructure its unmanned-systems bureaucracy, pulling more responsibilities out of Program Executive Office for Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC) and putting it in new places. Structural adjustments ordered by Navy Secretary John Phelan will reform the way that the Navy develops and administers its acquisition program for autonomous vessels, which promise to radically shrink and cost-optimize the idea of a fighting vessel - if they can be built and fielded in quantity. PEO USC handles multiple acquisition duties, including manned smaller-size combatants like the twin Littoral Combat Ship classes and the new Constellation-class frigate. The Constellation was delayed after significant Navy-specific design changes were imposed on the off-the-shelf FREMM design that the Navy selected from Fincantieri - a proven hull selected to minimize risk of delays in production. During detail design, the frigate was stretched in length and its internal layout was altered enough that it retained only 15% design commonality with the FREMM. PEO USC now holds responsibility for bringing that program to full-rate production. In a sign of the hurdles ahead, the Pentagon departed from the schedule for Constellation hull procurement this fiscal year and left the funds for one ship out of the budget. While PEO USC focuses on manned hulls, almost all of the Navy's development of oceangoing unmanned craft has happened in the Pentagon, outside of Naval Sea Systems Command. DARPA designed and built the Navy's first autonomous test vessel, Sea Hunter / ACTUV. The Defense Department's Strategic Capabilities Office built the Navy's next major testbed program, the Ghost Fleet Overlord crewboat series. And DARPA stepped in once again to design and build NOMARS, the fully-unmanned prototype completed at Nichols Brothers earlier this year. All have been or will be transferred to Navy ownership, but were conceptualized and developed outside of the service. The Navy is now under pressure to ramp up. In July, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered all of the service branches and combatant commanders to prioritize drone system development and put procurement closer to the front lines. ""Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our frontline troops,"" Hegseth wrote. ""Senior officers must overcome the bureaucracy's instinctive risk-aversion on everything from budgeting to weaponizing and training."" He called for eliminating ""self-imposed restrictions"" on development, and warned that ""our major risk is risk-avoidance"" when it comes to drone systems. In a memo released last week and obtained by Federal News Network, Secretary Phelan ordered a 30-day ""sprint"" review of unmanned system purchasing, coupled with a pause of all ""related acquisition decisions and contracting actions (including awards and modifications)"" during the review period. The review will cover every Navy and Marine Corps unmanned program or initiative, and will streamline administration and lines of effort - to take effect within 90 days. This retooled enterprise will be housed under a new Program Executive Office for Robotic and Autonomous systems (RAS), giving Navy unmanned systems their own PEO. Separately, Breaking Defense and USNI have learned that the Navy has rebooted its long-dormant carrier-based drone fighter program, which has disappeared from public view since the X-47B prototype was canceled in 2015. Over the 10 intervening years, the U.S. Air Force has publicized its extensive R&D with unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), and may have more undisclosed activity within its deep portfolio of classified projects; the Navy has not published much about its efforts - until now. According to Breaking Defense, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics and Anduril have all been contracted to produce designs for a ""loyal wingman"" or ""collaborative"" fighter drone that is carrier-capable. Armed, attritable UCAVs could change the way that carrier aviation operates, extending its reach and improving the survivability of manned fighters.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
Op-Ed: Facing the Fuel Facts About LNG,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-facing-the-fuel-facts-about-lng,,09/09/2025 00:13:00,,"The current drive to decarbonize the maritime industry strikes me as a similarly important and dramatic change to that which Malcom McLean organized with his sailing of the Ideal X in 1956. The almost unbelievable growth we have seen in international trade, sparked by the now ubiquitous container, required a strong vision of the future combined with a focused, unrelenting forward drive. As the container and intermodal industries grew, everyone had much the same concentrated and almost prophetic view of what had to be accomplished to satisfy the entrepreneurial spirit created by Mr. McLean. Now that we are in a new era of change to decarbonize the maritime industry, we need the same focus and vision of the future to ensure success. Great challenges require great people like Malcolm McLean with strong and realistic leadership. Like the growth of international trade facilitated by the container, challenges like decarbonization can only be achieved by identifying real benefits over the long term and showing a path forward that is realistic and practical. Today, when we evaluate the past 10 years or so of the decarbonization journey, we need to recognize and admit that we have all too often been diverted from a strong yet realistic vision by the proverbial “shiny object.” We know, and have known for years, that most alternative fuels are unlikely to be available in the quantities needed by shipping anytime soon. The exception is methane in the form of LNG. We know that liquid fuels and gases are often difficult to handle and can be unsafe for many reasons. Years and decades of experience handling these products is required to ensure the wellbeing of our seafarers, longshoremen and women, as well as those residing in or near port communities. LNG has a safety record that spans many decades. The energy value of fuels is also a critical matter. Not all fuels are created equal and many have energy densities that require a vessel to have almost double the tankage. This means more fuel and less revenue-generating capacity. Shipowners want to carry cargo, not fuel. Again here, methane as LNG is the standard others are measured against. With these facts, why have our industry and regulators been diverted from what might seem to be the focus and strong direction we need to realize local emissions and carbon reduction? In today’s modern world, opinions and ideas are available as never before. Opinions are often taken for fact and widely distributed in media and the Internet. Academics need to “publish or perish” and sometimes perform research based on unrealistic assumptions. Regulators and governments have a myriad of topics and concerns they need to deal with daily. Being pulled in many directions at once can and does create issues and concerns. With this backdrop, and when considering low and zero carbon fuels, our industry must ask practical questions and demand clear, well-supported and candid answers: Like Mr. McLean’s containerization, decarbonization demands we focus on the practical and realistic, face the fuel facts, and not get distracted by shiny objects. The reality is that, without a clear focus, no one will use any alternative fuel, they will simply continue with the status quo - heavy fuel oils. Peter Keller is the chairman of SEA-LNG and the former executive vice president of TOTE, Inc. He has served on the boards of the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), the Pacific Maritime Shipping Association and the United States Maritime Exchange (USMX), and he was inducted into the International Maritime Hall of Fame in 2006.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
DP World Selected to Design and Operate Montreal’s New Container Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-selected-to-design-and-operate-montreal-s-new-container-terminal,,08/09/2025 22:41:47,,"The Port of Montreal, Canada, and DP World Canada have entered into a joint development agreement for the land-based facilities for the port’s new container terminal at Contrecoeur on the St. Lawrence River. The facility has been in the planning stage for years, with work expected to start this year and completion by 2030. On the terms of the agreement, DP World Canada will work with the port authority over the next few months to finalize the design for the terminal as well as the terms of the construction and operating contract. The contract will take effect with the start of land work, which is expected in 2027. DP World Canada will oversee the construction of the terminal, including the container yard, building, utilities, and rail connection, and will have a 40-year operating agreement. The Montreal Port Authority began in the 1980s acquiring land in Contrecoeur, which is located approximately 50 miles to the north of the city on the south bank of the St. Lawrence. Port officials highlight that the current facilities on Montreal Island, which handled nearly 1.5 million TEU in 2024, will soon reach capacity. The plan for Contrecoeur calls for a capacity to handle 1.15 million TEU annually, a nearly 60 percent increase in the container handling capacity in the Port of Montreal. The new terminal will include two berths as well as container handling and storage areas. The flow of goods will also be improved in Montreal with integrated connections to road and rail networks at Contrecoeur. The construction plan for the new terminal uses a hybrid model, splitting responsibility for the water-side to the port and Canadian Coast Guard, while DP World will have responsibility for the land-side facilities. The goal is to start site preparation this year, once the final approvals are granted, and in-water work in 2026. The timeline calls for commissioning the new terminal in 2030. DP World notes that it will be its entry into the Port of Montreal. The company currently operates six port facilities in Canada, including in Vancouver, Prince Rupert, Fraser Surrey, Nanaimo, and Saint John.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
BIO-UV Group Develops Containerized Ballast Water Treatment,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/bio-uv-group-develops-containerized-ballast-water-treatment,,08/09/2025 20:50:40,,"[By: BIO-UV Group] BIO-UV Group, the global leader in UV-based water treatment solutions, has successfully developed and tested a containerised ballast water treatment system designed initially for the floating offshore wind sector. With the rapid development of floating offshore wind projects globally, ballast water compliance challenges have emerged because the movement of these floating platforms across territorial waters requires systems to prevent the spread of invasive marine species. “While the maritime industry has made significant strides in ballast water compliance, the floating offshore wind sector is just beginning to recognise its obligations under the Ballast Water Management Convention. Our system offers a portable, scalable solution that meets these needs effectively,” said Charlene Ceresola, Project Manager at BIO-UV Group. The initiative, funded in 2024 through the European Union’s ELBE EUROCLUSTER programme, was to adapt BIO-UV’s type-approved BIO-SEA for deployment in a standard TEU container, allowing operators to treat ballast water on-site during floating windmill assembly, transport, and maintenance. Initial trials focused on a 300m3/h capacity containerised BIO-SEA B02-0340 unit installed at the Euroports-operated Port-la-Nouvelle, in France. The main difference with onboard systems is the need to dispose of filter backwashed water at the place of discharge, which requires a separate waste treatment line. The prototype’s operation was evaluated through real-world testing, addressing challenges like connection compatibility, pressure drops, and on-site power limitations. These tests validated the unit’s capability to provide the approved BIO-SEA dual-stage treatment – filtration and UV exposure – ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirement, as well as the ability of handling backwash effluents, transforming them into manageable waste for land-based disposal. While biological trials were limited by external factors, such as sampling challenges and variability in water conditions, initial results showed promise. Discharge water has met the D-2 standard in all operations. The first phase of the project, spanning January to June 2024, focused on engineering and testing the containerised solution. Phase Two, running from July to December 2024, expanded the scope to include market analysis and stakeholder engagement, laying the groundwork for future iterations. “The modularity and portability of this solution make it ideal not only for offshore wind projects but also for emergency use by ships facing ballast water management system failures,” said Ceresola. For instance, portable units could be leased or purchased and deployed on barges or in ports to assist vessels with inoperable ballast water management systems, ensuring compliance with environmental standards during unexpected breakdowns. This capability would fill a critical gap in current maritime operations, offering ports and shipping companies a reliable and effective contingency plan. For the offshore wind sector, meanwhile, BIO-UV Group has provided the first commercial roll-out of a containerised unit this year under a “ballast as a service” rental scheme, enabling water treatment at any location. The success of the ELBE project has already attracted interest from Mediterranean ports, including those participating in the EU’s Treasure program – a series of R&D projects aimed at improving harbour water management and other environmental efficiencies, said Ceresola. “We can now provide ports and harbours with a practical, scalable solution that enables more industries to manage water responsibly. This project underscores our commitment to innovation and sustainability, paving the way for a cleaner, more resilient future.”",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
Second CSOV Newbuilding Delivered to Bernhard Schulte Offshore,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/second-csov-newbuilding-delivered-to-bernhard-schulte-offshore-2,,08/09/2025 20:47:52,,"[By: Bernhard Schulte Offshore] Bernhard Schulte Offshore (BSO) has taken delivery of its newest Commissioning Service Operation Vessel (CSOV), built by Ulstein Verft in Norway. The vessel, named ‘Windea Clausius’, was officially christened on 4 September and will serve the global offshore energy industry. “The new ‘Windea Clausius’ completes our modern offshore fleet which now comprises five state-of-the-art vessels,” says Matthias Müller, Managing Director at Bernhard Schulte Offshore. “The new ship and its sister vessel ‘Windea Curie’, which has been already delivered in June, are characterized by their innovative design features focused on reliability, operability, flexibility, and sustainability.” “The delivery of ‘Windea Clausius’ marks another important milestone in our long-standing collaboration with Bernhard Schulte Offshore. This vessel represents the forefront of maritime innovation, with a strong focus on sustainability, flexibility, and safety. We are proud to contribute to the green transition in the offshore industry by delivering solutions that combine high performance with a low environmental footprint,” says Lars Lühr Olsen, Managing Director, Ulstein Verft. ‘Windea Clausius’ features two sterns and azimuth propellers at both fore and aft, ensuring optimal performance in Dynamic Positioning (DP) operations and enhancing fuel efficiency. Regardless of whether the vessel is facing towards or away from the weather, it maintains excellent operability and flexibility. With the Ulstein’s TWIN X-STERN design, the ship can minimise motion—critical for safe gangway operations as well as crew and personnel well-being. Equipped with a large, height-adjustable, centrally located walk-to-work gangway and elevator tower for personnel and cargo transfers, the vessel also includes a 3D motion-compensated crane for offshore lifts of up to five tonnes. Onboard logistics are optimised with spacious storage areas and stepless access to offshore installations. In addition, ‘Windea Clausius’ features a height-adjustable boat landing system that allows for safe and stepless transfer of personnel and equipment between the CSOV and smaller crew transfer vessels—an important safety aspect especially while operating within offshore wind farms. The new ‘Windea Clausius’ offers up to 90 cabins with windows for charterers’ offshore personnel. In total, there are 111 cabins providing comfortable living conditions for up to 132 individuals. With hybrid battery propulsion and methanol fuel readiness, the vessel is designed for low-carbon operations and is ideally suited for both operations and maintenance (O&M) and construction support roles, particularly in harsh offshore environments. The newbuilding is named after the German physicist Rudolf Clausius whose work on thermodynamics established fundamental principles for understanding energy transformations, including wind energy. The naming continues the tradition of naming BSO’s offshore vessels after outstanding personalities and scientists, as the ‘Windea La Cour’, ‘Windea Leibniz’, ‘Windea Jules Verne’, and ‘Windea Curie.'",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
Ørsted and Iberdrola Are Trying to Save U.S. Offshore Wind Investments,https://maritime-executive.com/article/oersted-and-iberdrola-are-trying-to-save-u-s-offshore-wind-investments,,08/09/2025 20:44:20,,"Two major offshore wind developers, Ørsted and Iberdrola, have efforts underway to save their offshore wind projects in the United States. The companies are reportedly trying to win over the Trump administration, which opposes offshore wind energy, by emphasizing the larger investments in the United States. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Bloomberg reports, confirmed that the administration is “actively engaged in discussions” with Ørsted over the future of the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. According to the reports, Wright, during a presentation at the Council of Foreign Relations, confirmed that there is “a very active dialogue,” saying the issues of the wind farm were being “worked and discussed.” Last month, the Trump administration issued a stop work order for the project, which Ørsted said is 80 percent installed. The company highlighted its large investment, saying that all of the foundations for the 704 MW wind farm are installed and that 45 out of the 65 wind turbines have also been installed. The export cabling and the onshore power substation are nearly complete. Ørsted filed a lawsuit challenging the legal authority to suspend the project, calling it a necessary step. The company, however, also said it was continuing to seek a resolution with the administration. Spanish investment analysts are also saying that Iberdrola, the parent company of U.S. renewable energy company Avangrid, which is the developer for several major U.S. offshore wind farms, is also taking steps to protect its investment. It was revealed last week that the Trump administration was planning to challenge approvals for Avangrid’s New England 1 and 2 offshore projects granted in the last days of the Biden administration. Work was expected to begin this year on New England 1, a 791 MW project, and would be followed by the larger 1,080 MW second phase. The Trump administration’s moves against the offshore wind energy sector are raising broader concerns, with Avangrid potentially one of the most exposed. In addition to the permits for the New England offshore projects, Avangrid is the developer of Vineyard Wind 1, with Iberdrola telling investors in July that the project was already exporting power from 17 out of 62 planned turbines, with 23 turbines installed, and supplying approximately 30 percent (241 MW) of its full capacity of 806 MW. Congressman Bill Keating told the MV Times last week he was afraid the administration might target Vineyard Wind with a similar stop work order. Avangrid also holds licenses for the Kitty Hawk wind farm offshore from North Carolina. It is also the developer for a potential 3 GW Gulf of Maine wind farm. Analysts note that the U.S. offshore wind energy sector is a major part of Iberdrola’s investment and growth strategy. The analysts believe Iberdrola is highlighting its broader investment strategy to the Trump administration to protect its wind farm licenses. A third of the investments in the company’s 2024-2026 Strategic Plan, or more than $14.7 billion, are in the United States. The Trump administration has been proud to highlight the large investment commitments coming from foreign companies into the United States. Analyst Aranzazu Bueno at Bankinter believes the company will work to highlight its full investment potential to protect the offshore wind projects as its main growth avenue in the United States. The company will be presenting to investors on September 24, and there is some anticipation that it could grow its U.S. investment commitments to more than $21 billion. Wright, however, continues to question the viability of offshore wind energy. Bloberg reports he said the U.S. government is not responsible for a company’s finances, countering the claims of the large investments made into the offshore wind projects, which are now in jeopardy. He called offshore power “costly” and said it has “limited job potential.”",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17

In the comments, Cary S. Davis, AAPA President and CEO, emphasized that, “Infrastructure takes time to build. It cannot be expanded or contracted rapidly in response to crises or market trends. It is therefore critical to set up our ports for success with ample funding to prepare the American maritime industrial base to compete and win in a world marked by intense global competition and economic pressures.” One of AAPA’s top priorities for the next STR is an advanced appropriation of $10.9 billion over five years for the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP). This figure has already been shared with Congress and represents the total funding ports have applied for over the last five years of PIDP applications. Not only is PIDP in line with the Trump Administration’s big picture goal of restoring the maritime industry, but it also unlocks non-federal investment in port infrastructure. On average, for every dollar ports apply for from PIDP, they match that application with a dollar of state, local, or private investment to match every Federal dollar of project costs.

Rystad Energy New Definitive Study On Marine LNG Well-To-Tank Emissions,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/rystad-energy-new-definitive-study-on-marine-lng-well-to-tank-emissions,,08/09/2025 20:07:34,,"[By: Rystad Energy] Independent research and energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy has published the results of a landmark study on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the LNG bunker supply chain, commissioned by SEA-LNG. This is the most accurate and up-to-date certified data on LNG as a marine fuel designed to help guide the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) Net-Zero Framework and future fuel policy. The implications for policy makers developing regulations to decarbonise shipping resulting from this study are: The study finds that the global well-to-tank emissions intensity for LNG bunkering fuel in 2024 is 13.9g CO2e/MJ (LHV). Carbon dioxide dominates global WtT emissions, responsible for 84% of emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions were most prevalent in the liquefaction stage, responsible for 99% of the stage’s 5.9 g CO2e/MJ. Methane emissions were responsible for 16% of total WtT emissions, equivalent to 2.2 g CO2e/MJ. They were most prevalent in upstream gas production lifecycle stage, responsible for 38% of total emissions from that stage. On a global basis, upstream gas production and liquefaction were responsible for the majority of bunker supply chain emissions at 30% and 43% respectively. Consequently, these two stages should be the focus for most future decarbonisation efforts. From the upstream perspective, methane mitigation is best poised to deliver the greatest emissions reduction benefits. Improvements in liquefaction emissions have been observed over recent years, tied to greater utilisation of more efficient technologies. It is likely this trend will continue when coupled with key electrification projects using renewable energy such as hydro and solar power. With around 95% of vessels still powered by oil-based marine fuels, LNG represents the leading alternative and already accounts for nearly 20% of the vessel orderbook. As the industry transitions toward net-zero and prepares for a rapidly expanding fleet of LNG-fuelled vessels, understanding the real-world lifecycle emissions of LNG is critical to shaping effective regulation and guiding future investment decisions. Results also show wide variation between regions and cargoes, reflecting differences in gas sources, liquefaction technologies, and shipping distances. In some cases, emissions intensities differed by as much as 6.6 g CO2e/MJ, highlighting that a single global average does not capture the full picture and risks leading to poorly informed regulatory choices. Patrick King, Vice President Emissions Research, Rystad Energy commented: “Our analysis is based on asset-level data that ties specific gas fields to liquefaction facilities. This approach, supported by satellite-detected methane plume data and reported asset information, gives a more accurate picture of the LNG actually used for bunkering, rather than relying on outdated or overly broad averages.” Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, said: “Policymakers must create regulations that reflect the true carbon intensity of marine fuels, rewarding reductions across the supply chain. Marine regulators should incentivise participants in the LNG bunker supply chain to continue to reduce GHG emissions.” Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG, concluded: “This landmark report sets the high standards the IMO should demand on such a key topic as alternative fuel emissions and performance within the Net-Zero Framework. Decisions must be based on real and recent data or risk undermining the significant progress already made along the practical and realistic LNG pathway to decarbonisation.” Download the full Rystad Energy LNG well-to-tank emissions analysis here.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17

Red Sea Escalation: Israel Readies Further Attacks on the Houthis,https://maritime-executive.com/article/red-sea-escalation-israel-readies-further-attacks-on-the-houthis,,08/09/2025 19:51:12,,"Houthi forces in Yemen have intensified their drone attacks on Israel. On September 7, one of four drones fired at Israel was identified by air defense forces, but not categorized as threat; it hit a terminal building at Ramon International Airport north of Eilat, injuring a civilian. Another three drones in the same wave were shot down over the Egyptian Sinai. Although Ramon airport was quickly re-opened, this was the first occasion for some time where a Houthi missile or drone has hit a target and caused damage. On September 8, Ramon airport was again targeted, but all three Houthi drones in the wave were detected and destroyed. Israel always responds to such attacks, and the response on this occasion is likely to be severe, given the scale of the Houthi attack and the propaganda value of its limited success. Israeli military planners will be aware that the Houthis are now recovering from attacks launched on July 7 against Houthi port facilities in Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa. Open source analyst Ben Tzion Macales has examined before-and-after imagery at all three locations. Craters have been filled, and damage has either been repaired or alternative facilities commissioned, such that all three have resumed operations. Moreover, the complex attack mounted on August 28 by units of both the Israeli Air Force and Navy has not had any noticeable effect as yet either on Houthi policy or operational capability. Prime Minister Ahmed Al Rahawi was killed alongside nine other ministers and two members of the cabinet secretariat. However, these cabinet figures were largely technocrats, and the Houthi political leadership, including the Minister of Defense Mohamed Al Atifi and Chief of the General Staff Muhammad Abd Al Karim Al Ghamari appear to have survived. By dint of their narrow escape, the Houthi leadership is likely to have been emboldened to intensify their campaign against Israel, as has subsequently transpired. Israel is in the process of mounting its largest-ever military operation in Gaza. At the same time, terrorist attacks in the West Bank have intensified, the situation both in Lebanon and Syria requires constant operational readiness, and Ms Greta Thunberg is about to set off from Tunis with the Global Sumud Flotilla Mission to distract the Israeli Navy off the Gaza coast. Israeli forces are thus over-stretched, but will nevertheless be seeking to launch an operation against the Houthis of a much greater scale – intending that this time, despite the dearth of intelligence, it will succeed in neutralizing the continued missile and drone threat posed by the Houthis. Such an attack is likely to involve both Israeli naval and air forces.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
"India Plans to Blacklist 86 Vessels, Ordering Immediate Crew Repatriation",https://maritime-executive.com/article/india-plans-to-blacklist-86-vessels-ordering-immediate-crew-repatriation,,08/09/2025 19:34:28,,"India’s Directorate General of Shipping (DGS) published a draft circular outlining steps it plans to take against a group of 86 vessels, which it says have recurrent reports of seafarer abuse, problems with working conditions, have been detained by port authorities, or are operating without proper paperwork. The move comes as the industry has been pushing for increased action after the International Transport Workers’ Federation warned that abandonments are running at a record high level. The draft circular, which is dated September 5, highlights that the DGS has received repeated complaints and reports of abandonment, detention, or arrest of Indian seafarers on certain vessels. A majority of the vessels, it also asserts, are operating without minimum mandatory documents, including valid P&I insurance. They also report “poor compliance” from recruiting and placement agencies, saying the vessels are operating without proper documentation for the seafarers. Further, the Indian authority reports that in many cases it has not received responses when approaching the respective flag state or port states for the vessels. Under the maritime labor conventions, states have obligations when owners/operators abandon vessels within their registries. The cases being cited include non-payment of wages, lack of repatriation, and inhuman and unsafe working conditions. They also report that the vessels have been detained by port authorities and, in some cases, have been involved in cases of cheating and fraud. A total of 86 vessels have been identified in 2025 based on “the gravity, recurrence, and enforcement challenges.” The DGS reports “show cause” notices have been issued to several crewing agencies linked to the ships. The list of ships is varied both in type of vessel and flag. One name that immediately stands out is the product tanker Eagle S, which is at the center of the case in Finland, alleging the tanker intentionally dragged its anchor, damaging undersea cables. Three crewmembers, including one Indian national, are currently on trial in Finland. Other vessels listed include general cargo ships, tankers, and a RoPax. The draft circular directs the recruiting and placement agencies to immediately stop recruiting or engaging Indian seafarers on the blacklisted vessels. Further, they are directed to arrange the prompt sign-off at the earliest possible port for the Indian crewmembers and their safe repatriation to India with wages, health, and welfare entitlements. The agencies are also required to provide reports within 14 days detailing the seafarers employed on the vessels. They are to detail their repatriation status and wages, and any outstanding pay. Agencies that fail to complete the steps are threatened with suspension or cancellation of their licenses. The ITF called for new actions, warning in August that the rate of abandonment was seeing a “disturbing surge” in 2025. It reported having recorded 2,648 cases of seafarer abandonment across 259 vessels compared to 3,133 seafarers abandoned in all of 2024. That was up 87 percent from 2023.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
MARL International & Apex Industries to Light New Canadian Navy Destroyers,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/marl-international-apex-industries-to-light-new-canadian-navy-destroyers,,08/09/2025 19:28:30,,"[By: MARL International] MARL International, part of Glamox, a global leader in lighting, announced today that it is partnering with Canadian firm Apex Industries, which will manufacture its marine lighting systems under licence in Canada for three destroyers for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Apex Industries was awarded the lighting systems contract by Irving Shipbuilding, which will build the vessels at its shipyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while Lockheed Martin Canada will provide the defence equipment. The vessels are part of the River Class Destroyer programme. The lighting contract covers the first three ships, with options for a further three. The RCN plans a total of 15 vessels designated ‘River Class,’ as they are named after Canadian rivers. The interior and exterior of each warship will be fitted with energy-efficient LED marine lights, including emergency lighting, along with light management systems for their operation. An initial total of around 9,000 lights will be supplied. MARL International, which was acquired by Glamox in August 2024, is subcontracted to Apex as the lighting design authority. MARL will transfer licensing rights to Apex to manufacture and assemble the marine lighting at Apex’s production facility in Moncton, New Brunswick. “We are delighted to partner with Glamox’s MARL International and value its commitment to transfer its technology to Canada,” said Keith Parlee, CEO of Apex Industries. “The partnership not only enables the growth of our Moncton workforce but positions Apex to strengthen our offerings to a wider Canadian supply chain.” The first three River-class vessels are named HMCS Fraser, HMCS Saint-Laurent, and HMCS Mackenzie. They are based on the ‘Global Combat Ship’ design used by the UK Royal Navy’s Type 26 frigates and the Royal Australian Navy’s Hunter-class frigates. The RCN vessels will replace the Navy’s Iroquois-class destroyers and Halifax-class frigates and will be able to perform a range of roles, from high-intensity conflict to humanitarian aid. “Our collaboration with Apex Industries continues Glamox’s history of lighting vessels for the Royal Canadian Navy over the past 35 years. This latest contract marks another significant achievement for the Glamox Group,” said Astrid Simonsen Joos, Group CEO of Glamox. “Our long-term licensing agreement with Apex ensures that our lighting is produced in Canada, and MARL is a partner within the Apex team, which will support Canada’s industrial and technological needs for years to come.” The first ship lighting package is scheduled to be delivered by the end of 2026, with lighting for the other vessels delivered thereafter. These warships are expected to enter service with the RCN in the early 2030s.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
"Spain Expands Embargo on Israel, Barring Tankers and Closing Airspace",https://maritime-executive.com/article/spain-expands-embargo-on-israel-barring-tankers-and-closing-airspace,,08/09/2025 19:24:20,,"The Spanish government announced a series of new actions expanding its previous arms embargo on Israel in response to the latest rounds of fighting in Gaza. Israel’s Foreign Minister responded angrily, prompting Spain to further announce it has recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a total of nine steps in a video statement saying they were being taken in response to the ongoing fighting in Gaza. “The Spanish government believes that protecting your country is one thing, and bombing hospitals and starving innocent children to death is quite another.” Among the specific steps the government said it would take are prohibiting the transit through Spanish ports for all ships carrying fuel to the Israeli armed forces. It also said that it would deny entry into Spanish airspace to all state aircraft transporting defense materials to Israel and take other steps limiting travel and Israeli officials' travel into Spain. According to the reports, the efforts will have to be approved by the Spanish parliament. Spain claims to have a “de facto” arms embargo in place on Israel, announced in October 2023 and enforced since May 2024. The Prime Minister said they would formalize this with the approval of a Royal Decree Law that consolidates the arms embargo. Separately, they also announced a further increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza. Activists had been pressuring Spain, including a series of actions in 2024 targeting cargo ships making port calls in Spain. Maersk Line, Ltd., which operates ships with a contract to the U.S. government, diverted some of its ships to Morocco while denying the activist claims that it was carrying illegal materials to Israel. Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar released an angry response to Spain’s actions, linking them to antisemitism. He called the actions “a hostile anti-Israel line, with wild rhetoric dripping with hatred.” He traced Spain’s actions against the Jewish people back to the Inquisition and other “ethnic cleansing” in the 1500s. Turkey, last month, took a similar action, expanding its trade embargo on Israel.

Panama Police Seize Drugs from In-Transit Maersk Container,https://maritime-executive.com/article/panama-police-seize-drugs-from-in-transit-maersk-container,,08/09/2025 19:00:11,,"Police in Panama are investigating where and when an “illicit substance” was placed in a shipping container that was in transit in Panama. The seizure, which took place over the weekend, comes as Panama is increasing its efforts, and government officials are pushing ports to increase surveillance efforts on cargo moving through the country. Panama’s news network TVN is saying the discovery was made as part of a “routine and random operation” carried out at the port of Balboa. The search and seizure, which, from the video released, appeared to be in an access hatch on the container, discovered 39 packages of suspected drugs. The police in their statement did not say why the particular container was targeted for the search. They reported it was an operation carried out in coordination with the Public Prosecutor’s Office.

Maersk’s vessel tracking shows the vessel had made stops in Spain, the U.S., Mexico, and Colombia before reaching Panama. There is no indication of when they think the drugs might have been placed in the container, and it was noted that they were found through the access hatch without opening the doors of the container. The situation is unusual as TVN reports that Panama remains a strategic transit point for international criminal organizations, but most of the traffic is bound to, not coming from, Europe. The news report says Security Minister Frank Abrego noted a lack of trained personnel to operate scanners in the ports. The devices are not being continuously operated, but the government is ordering the ports to rectify this within the next 15 days. Further, they report that the President of Panama will conduct a meeting with port managers as part of the efforts to strengthen port security and to further reduce drug trafficking. TVN reports the emphasis is in part a response to a spike in the amount of narcotics seized at port terminals in Panama this year. It says that up to seven tons of drugs were seized in the first eight months of the year. Moroccan media are also reporting a strong increase in seizures, with over 123 tons of cannabis, 1.9 tons of cocaine, and 16.5 kilograms of heroin seized at the country’s ports in 2024.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 09:31:17
Why the US Navy Needs a Lessons-Learned Center for Shipbuilding,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/why-the-us-navy-needs-a-lessons-learned-center-for-shipbuilding,,08/09/2025 18:56:00,,"[By Dr. Marcus Jones] In March 2025 testimony before the House Armed Services Committee’s Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, Ronald O’Rourke, naval analyst for the Congressional Research Service since 1984, sharpened an excellent recommendation he has raised over more than a decade: the U.S. Navy should establish a dedicated institutional mechanism for systematically capturing, analyzing, and transmitting lessons learned from its shipbuilding programs. Although the U.S. Navy has accumulated an extraordinary body of experience in ship design and construction over more than two centuries, it continues to make avoidable mistakes in major acquisition programs such as proceeding into construction with incomplete designs, integrating immature technologies, projecting unrealistic cost and schedule estimates, and eroding accountability structures once a program becomes politically or industrially “too big to fail.” These errors are not unique to the Navy, but they are particularly consequential in the context of shipbuilding, where program timelines are long, platforms are few and expensive, and consequences are measured in strategic as well as fiscal terms. O’Rourke’s solution is a “lessons-learned center” for naval shipbuilding: a dedicated, continuous, and institutionalized effort to capture knowledge from past programs, distill it into accessible form, and ensure it informs future design, acquisition, and oversight decisions. The value of such an entity, he argues, would lie in its ability to prevent repeated mistakes, reduce waste, improve program outcomes, and help sustain the Navy’s long-term force design and industrial base goals. It addresses key features of the Navy’s acquisition environment: the discontinuous and generational nature of major shipbuilding programs; the structural fragmentation of knowledge across commands, contractors, and government agencies; and the absence of an educational or doctrinal home for critical institutional memory. Unlike weapons or aircraft programs, which may see dozens or hundreds of iterations within a single career, major ship classes are often designed and constructed once every 20 or 30 years. The effect of this long cycle time is that most individuals involved in a new class of ships – whether program managers, naval architects, flag officers, or congressional staffers – may have had no direct role in the last one. What should be institutional memory therefore becomes diffuse personal recollection, vulnerable to retirement, reassignment, or obsolescence. Moreover, the knowledge necessary to understand past program outcomes is distributed across a complex web of organizations: Program Executive Offices, NAVSEA and its affiliated labs and centers, shipyards and primes and sub-tier contractors, OPNAV resource sponsors, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and various congressional committees and watchdogs. Each retains only partial and often incompatible records, and there is little incentive or mechanism for aggregating these into a unified analytic understanding. While internal program reviews, GAO reports, and RAND studies may document lessons after the fact, there has never been an entity within the Navy tasked with curating, synthesizing, or teaching these insights. Interestingly, O’Rourke does not propose a narrowly bureaucratic mechanism but envisions a range of possible instantiations, from a structured repository of documents to a more active, curriculum- and wargame-integrated enterprise. But what matters in his framing is not form but function: the institutionalization of a reflective capacity for learning from experience and applying that learning prospectively in ways that materially improve outcomes. Such a capability, if properly implemented, would amount to a kind of strategic memory for the Navy, one able to withstand changes in leadership, budget, and political context, while enabling the service to treat shipbuilding not as a sequence of isolated procurements but as a continuous and evolving system of practice. It is not, therefore, a technocratic fix for acquisition inefficiencies, but a cultural transformation within the Navy’s approach to its own history of design, development, and production. It holds out the prospect that the Navy would not only save money and avoid failure, but reaffirm its preferred identity as a thinking, adaptive, and strategically serious organization. It is this deeper institutional value – far beyond process improvement – that makes O’Rourke’s proposal for a naval shipbuilding lessons-learned center important and long overdue. Joint Lessons on Lessons Learned The idea has modest precedent and ample justification. One of the most robust models of institutional learning in the defense sector is the U.S. Army’s Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL), established in 1985 in response to the operational shortcomings revealed during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada. CALL’s mission was to systematically collect, analyze, and disseminate operational and tactical lessons. Over time, it became fully integrated into Army doctrine and planning, fielding collection teams, producing analytic bulletins, and shaping professional military education. But of particular relevance to the Navy’s shipbuilding enterprise is a less widely known but equally instructive initiative: the Center for Army Acquisition Lessons Learned (CAALL), housed within the Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity. Established following the 2010 Army Acquisition Review, which cited the absence of a centralized mechanism for analyzing acquisition successes and failures, CAALL provides an authoritative source for acquisition-specific lessons across the Army’s program offices. It operates a web-enabled Acquisition Lessons Learned Portal (ALLP) through which project teams submit concise, structured, and searchable lessons, each tagged by acquisition phase, milestone, cost and schedule impact, and functional category. These are not vague observations, but distilled from real program experience and embedded in metadata-rich formats that support both searchability and trend analysis. CAALL analysts conduct deep-dive studies of recurring issues, such as documentation burden, Earned Value Management failures, or test duplication, and prepare “just-in-time” lesson packages for project managers entering specific acquisition phases. The Center also engages in outreach, publishes bulletins, curates spotlight topic zones, and supports internal Army decision-making with synthesized data on the top five systemic challenges facing Army programs. It demonstrates that institutional learning is within reach but requires structured data, a deliberate submission pipeline, professional analytical support, and educational integration. It also shows how lessons can be transformed from static reflections into dynamic inputs for decision support, policy revision, and curriculum development. Most importantly, CAALL demonstrates that such a capability can be sustained over time, through leadership endorsement, modest staffing, and the aggressive use of digital tools. A shipbuilding-focused counterpart – scaled appropriately to the Navy’s size, resourced modestly, and empowered to draw insight from both current and historical programs – would not need to reinvent the wheel. It would only need to learn how others have made their institutions learn. Other models further underscore the feasibility and necessity of such a capability. The Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP) applies a five-phase process – discovery, validation, resolution, evaluation, and dissemination – to lessons arising from joint exercises, operations, and experiments. Its information system, JLLIS, acts as a system of record for tracking, archiving, and analyzing lessons that affect force development and joint capability planning. A more technical and directly relevant precedent is found in NASA’s Lessons Learned Information System (LLIS).4 NASA’s LLIS arose from the hard-won awareness, following the Challenger and Columbia disasters, that high-stakes engineering efforts demand not only risk management tools but a durable culture of reflection and improvement. NASA’s system integrates lessons into program planning and design reviews and allows for long-term traceability of decisions and failures. The agency’s approach, emphasizing root cause analysis, organizational memory, and education, aligns with the intended mission of an NSLLC to translate the history of naval shipbuilding experience into anticipatory guidance for future programs. Like NASA, the Navy deals with one-off, bespoke, high-cost platforms with life cycles spanning decades. The discipline required to learn systematically from such endeavors is the same. Even in the commercial sector, complex system integrators such as Boeing, Airbus, and multinational energy firms have turned to lessons-learned systems, both formal and ad hoc, to analyze catastrophic failures and to course-correct future programs. The Construction Industry Institute’s lessons-learned repositories, used by engineering and construction firms to improve execution of large-scale infrastructure projects, is still another model for post-project analysis and feedback. These efforts are often grounded in shared technical taxonomies, design decision trees, and “causal maps” that allow construction organizations to relate performance outcomes to earlier architectural or managerial choices. The Navy’s shipbuilding community, which is distinguished by even greater system and technological complexities and similar exposure to path-dependent design choices, lacks such a coherent and systematized mechanism. An NSLLC would hold out the promise of that capability. Of course, these precedents cannot simply be imitated wholesale, but they offer essential lessons in form, function, and value. Each succeeds not by relying on passive documentation and informal processes, but by embedding structured learning into the decision cycles and professional cultures of their organizations. What an NSLLC must do is adapt this logic to the particularities of U.S. naval shipbuilding: its long timelines, institutional fragmentation, industrial dependencies, and strategic visibility. It must provide an analytic and educational platform that helps naval leaders and engineers reason more effectively about cost, capability, risk, and design. It must produce continuity across ship classes and across generations of acquisition professionals. And it must do so not as a retrospective archive alone, but as a living resource embedded in professional education, program governance, and future planning. Over the past several decades, the U.S. Navy has been the subject of repeated and increasingly urgent calls to establish a formal mechanism for doing just that, all of which have, time and again, failed to take root. While the service has often acknowledged the recurrence of major programmatic mistakes – most notably in high-profile acquisition efforts such as the Littoral Combat Ship, the Zumwalt-class destroyer, and the Ford-class aircraft carrier – it has not developed a durable, institutionalized capacity for engineering and acquisition-oriented organizational learning. This failure has not gone unremarked. A lineage of initiatives, proposals, and critiques – some internal, some external, some aspirational, others postmortem – has identified the absence of such a capacity as a root contributor to the Navy’s persistent shipbuilding troubles. Perhaps the most compelling of these efforts is a 2022 MIT thesis by naval engineer Elliot Collins, which deserves attention not only for its technical sophistication but for its diagnosis of a deep institutional shortcoming. Collins, a Navy officer serving in the DDG(X) design program, observed firsthand what he describes as a structural absence of organizational memory in Navy ship design and acquisition. His thesis, written under the auspices of MIT’s Naval Construction and Engineering program, proposes the creation of a Navy Design Notebook System (NDNS): a digital, structured, and lifecycle-aware framework for recording and organizing design decisions, assumptions, lessons, and engineering rationale across a ship’s development. Drawing inspiration from both Toyota’s engineering notebook practice and the best traditions of systems engineering, Collins lays out a clear taxonomy and architecture for capturing knowledge in real time and rendering it useful across multiple programs and decades. Crucially, the NDNS is not just a data storage concept, but a model for how design reasoning can be institutionalized so that the lessons of one generation are accessible and intelligible to the next. The significance of Collins’s proposal lies in the lineage of failed or underdeveloped efforts that it implicitly seeks to redeem. As far back as the 1970s, the Navy undertook an informal initiative known as the REEF POINTS series, pamphlet-style reflections on acquisition experience intended to help incoming program officers. But the REEF POINTS effort lacked formal backing, consistent authorship, or archival permanence, and it quickly faded as personnel rotated out and no office assumed responsibility for sustaining it. Later assessments, including a 1993 Department of Defense Inspector General report, found that the Navy lacked a centralized system for capturing acquisition lessons learned, and more critically, that it made little practical use of the systems it did possess. Data were gathered, but not applied; observations made, but not preserved; patterns noted, but not internalized. The diagnosis repeated itself in a 2002 analytical review commissioned by the Army’s War College, which found that across the Department of Defense, lessons-learned programs often failed not for lack of insight but for lack of organizational stewardship, cultural support, and procedural integration. Why, then, despite these longstanding recognitions, has the Navy failed to institutionalize a lasting lessons-learned capability in its shipbuilding enterprise? The reasons are multiple and reflect a misalignment between the operational culture of the Navy and the administrative and engineering demands of ship design. Unlike the tactical communities of naval aviation or undersea warfare – where debriefing, checklist revisions, and iterative training are ingrained – the acquisition enterprise lacks a comparable feedback loop. Moreover, the Navy’s engineering education pathways, from undergraduate technical training to postgraduate systems curricula, have not systematically incorporated acquisition case studies or design failures into their pedagogy. There is no consistent mechanism to bring shipbuilding experience into the classroom, the wargame, or the design studio. Lessons remain tacit, siloed, and anecdotal. That the Navy has lacked such a capacity for so long is a failure of imagination and institutional design, but it not an irremediable one. The architecture of such a capability already exists in other domains, from NASA to the Army to the commercial nuclear sector. The Navy does not need to invent a solution from whole cloth; it needs to adapt proven models to its own technical and cultural context. What is required is not another ad hoc study or retrospective review, but the establishment of a permanent Naval Shipbuilding Lessons-Learned Center, a durable institutional home where technical memory, engineering reasoning, and acquisition insight can be collected, structured, and applied. The central question, then, is not whether such a center is needed, but what it should consist of, how it should function, and where it should reside. The Devil in the Details To be more than a bureaucratic corrective or another forgotten archive, a shipbuilding lessons-learned program must fulfill a set of core functions as intellectually rigorous as the failures it seeks to prevent and not just catalog what has gone wrong in previous programs or indulge in generalities about process improvement. The first and most essential function is to identify and preserve actual lessons: not loose observations or platitudes, but knowledge with clear causal content, derived from real program experience, and supported by traceable evidence. To qualify as such, a lesson must demonstrate causal specificity: what precisely caused the outcome it describes, and why. It must be replicable or at least transferable across contexts, suggesting how it might inform other ship types or acquisition models. It must be traceable to primary sources – engineering drawings, test data, milestone reviews – so that its logic can be reconstructed and its authority verified. It must be actionable, capable of informing future decisions, whether at the level of design margin, contract structure, or policy architecture. And ideally, it should possess counterfactual depth: the ability to show not only what happened, but what might have happened differently under other choices. When filtered through this lens, the lessons that matter and that a center must preserve fall broadly into five categories. First are design integration lessons, insights into how complex systems interact within the hull, and how early design assumptions or immature technologies can generate cascading failures, as in the DDG-1000’s power system or the Ford-class’s EMALS launch mechanism. Second are construction and manufacturing lessons, which speak to the translation of design into physical product: the timing of block assembly, the thresholds at which digital coordination outperforms paper-based workflows, the effects of workforce experience on productivity. Third are program management and acquisition lessons (perhaps the most politically fraught) concerning contract type selection, milestone pacing, and the dangers of concurrency. Fourth are industrial base and supply chain lessons, which trace how changes in the broader defense industrial ecosystem—supplier attrition, workforce bottlenecks, fragility in the materials base—constrain program execution in ways the Navy and its private shipbuilders often fail to anticipate. And finally, there are historical, strategic, and doctrinal lessons, which reveal how misalignments between strategic ambition and industrial reality (fleet design concepts that outpace build capacity, for instance) can derail even well-managed programs. Still, it is not enough just to identify them; lessons must be preserved and organized within a structure that allows them to be used. Here, the Navy can draw on models such as that proposed by Collins in his thesis: a digital, lifecycle-aware knowledge framework that tags and stores design decisions, assumptions, and lessons in a manner that makes them accessible not only to current program staff but to future generations. Such a system would form the backbone of the NSLLC’s information architecture: structured, searchable, phase-referenced, and durable. It would allow engineers working on SSN(X) to understand not just that the Virginia-class succeeded or stumbled in certain areas, but why, under what constraints, and according to which tradeoffs. It would enable program sponsors to distinguish between lessons that were context-specific and those that reflect deeper structural patterns. Ultimately, the most critical function of the NSLLC, however, is not archival but pedagogical. Lessons, to be meaningful, must be taught as part of a living curriculum, and not simply as dry memoranda or summary slides. The center must work directly with educational institutions to embed lessons into the professional formation of officers, policy officials, engineers, and acquisition professionals. This means developing decision-forcing cases that place students in the shoes of historical program leaders, confronting them with the actual dilemmas and constraints those leaders faced. It means designing wargames and exercises that test tradeoffs in acquisition, industrial surge, and fleet composition. It means seeding capstone projects, research initiatives, and faculty development efforts with questions drawn from real program history. And it means, above all, creating a culture in which experience is not simply remembered but used as a guide to reasoning, as a check against institutional hubris or forgetfulness, and as a source of comparative advantage in a strategic environment where time and resources are finite. Finally, the Center must function diagnostically on behalf of Navy decision-makers, as a resource for the review of future program plans, bringing to bear its corpus of structured knowledge to identify early warning signs of known failure modes, or to highlight opportunities for constructive borrowing across ship classes. This is not a matter of punitive oversight, but of anticipatory guidance and bringing past reasoning to bear on present decisions in a way that deepens accountability and reduces risk. What this amounts to is a knowledge institution, not in the narrow academic sense but in the most operationally vital sense of the term. The NSLLC would exist to ensure that the U.S. Navy no longer builds its ships without memory. It would translate past pain into future prudence, and costly failure into usable foresight. And it would mark, at last, the point at which naval shipbuilding began to behave not just as a procurement function, but as a learning system worthy of the stakes it bears. The Way Ahead What would such a center look like in practice? If the value of a Naval Shipbuilding Lessons-Learned Center lies in the integrity and usability of its knowledge, then its organizational structure must be equally deliberate. It should not replicate the diffuse and stovepiped landscape of existing program oversight offices, but rather bridge engineering, acquisition, policy, and education communities. And in keeping with the realities of today’s defense fiscal environment, it must be lean, digitally enabled, and architected from the start to minimize overhead. The NSLLC should be organized as a small, hybrid analytical and educational unit with as small a group of affiliated personnel as circumstances permit, including naval engineers with experience in major design and production programs; acquisition professionals familiar with contracting and program management dynamics; historians of technology and naval policy who can trace institutional lineages and doctrinal consequences; and digital knowledge architects to manage its structured repository and analytic tools. Core activities would be augmented by short-term fellows – rotating billets for officers, civilians, or academics on sabbatical or detail – who would conduct targeted case studies, contribute to curriculum development, or lead diagnostic reviews of current programs. Rather than attempt to recreate or replace existing program data flows, the Center should connect to them and draw from NAVSEA, PEO Ships and Submarines, CRS, GAO, and DoD IG reports, but synthesize across them with the purpose of creating pedagogically and analytically coherent insights. To reduce cost and footprint, the Center must leverage digital tools aggressively. A cloud-based digital architecture, modeled in part on the NDNS framework, would form the heart of the operation: a searchable, metadata-tagged, phase-referenced archive of lessons that supports analysis, instruction, and red-teaming of future programs. Visualization tools like interactive timelines, decision trees, and traceability matrices should be prioritized over staff-intensive publishing or editorial operations. Whenever possible, the Center’s materials should be reusable across formats: a single case study might underpin a midshipman seminar, an acquisition wargame, and a policy memo to ASN(RDA). In this sense, the Center is less a physical institute than a virtual and modular capability: one that enables reflection, instruction, and anticipatory decision support wherever shipbuilding is debated or taught. As to its location, the author will admit to a conflict-of-interest, being a longtime member of the U.S. Naval Academy faculty. It may, therefore, sound parochial to suggest that the NSLLC be housed at Annapolis. That said, there are good reasons, symbolic and practical, why the Naval Academy may be a fitting institutional home. The Academy is the Navy’s enduring schoolhouse, the place where generations of officers are introduced not just to the fleet, but to the long arc of naval experience. It offers a rare confluence of technical education, historical reflection, and leadership formation. Moreover, it sits proximate to the Washington-area institutions with which the NSLLC would regularly interact – NAVSEA, the Navy labs and warfare centers, OPNAV and the Secretariat organization, and the various acquisition and oversight bodies headquartered in the capital region. Perhaps most importantly, the Academy is a place not just of training, but of memory. To locate the Center there would signal that lessons are not just compliance artifacts or after-action musings, but a core component of professional identity. It would allow the Center’s work to be integrated directly into engineering coursework, capstone design, fleet seminars, and acquisition electives. And it would give midshipmen, from the beginning of their careers, access to a body of knowledge that has existed until now only in fragments. But what matters is not the administrative chain but the Center’s function: to make memory usable, to make learning permanent, and to help the Navy move from a culture of crisis improvisation to one of cumulative, adaptive competence. Wherever it is housed, a Naval Shipbuilding Lessons-Learned Center should embody the values it seeks to cultivate: frugality, clarity, and strategic discipline. And in doing so, it may just help the Navy build not only better ships, but a better institution.

Shipowners And Operators Urged to Address Evolving Safety Risks,https://maritime-executive.com/features/shipowners-and-operators-urged-to-address-evolving-safety-risks,,08/09/2025 18:31:00,,"A clear uptick in casualties in 2024, driven by machinery damage/failure and an aging fleet, stands out in the latest analysis of Lloyd’s List Intelligence casualty data. The number of maritime casualties rose by 15% in 2024. Between 2018 and 2024, the number of incidents increased by 42%, while the number of vessels in the global fleet increased by 10% over the same period. This represents a concerning development for the maritime industry, particularly with the global fleet growing at a considerably slower rate. Continuous increase in machinery failures boosts casualty rate Machinery damage/failure has traditionally accounted for the largest portion of incidents. However, its share has increased significantly over the course of the past decade. In 2014, this accounted for 38% of all incidents but rose to 60% by 2024. The reasons for these kinds of casualties are wide and varied, but top of the list is the aging global fleet. In 2014, 36% of the global fleet was 25 years or older, with a further 7% in the 20-24 years age category. In 2024, 44% of the global fleet was over 25 years old, with 9% in the 20-24 years age category. Factors driving the aging fleet and delayed vessel scrapping A range of different factors are contributing to the aging fleet. In recent years, there has been high demand for tonnage, with this translating into sky-high freight rates, particularly in 2024. Many shipowners are delaying the scrapping of vessels that would normally be decommissioned, opting to profit from these assets instead. Other factors such as new regulations from the IMO and EU on emissions and fuel efficiency, have also made shipowners hesitant to invest in newbuilds. Limited space in shipyards and high cost of newbuilding is also pushing shipowners to focus on extending the lifecycle of existing assets rather than replacing them. Either way, the aging global fleet is clearly having an impact on casualty statistics. In 2024, 52% of all incidents were attributable to vessels 20 years of age or older, with 41% from vessels in the 25+ age category. In contrast, 41% of incidents in 2014 came from vessels over 20 years old, with 32% coming from the 25+ age category. For machinery damage/failures, age is an even bigger factor. In 2024, a total of 45% of these kinds came from vessels over 25 years of age, with a further 12% in the 20-24 age category. In 2014, the corresponding figures were 39% and 9%, respectively. The aging fleet is also a significant factor in the number of hull damages, which increased by 7% (114 incidents) in 2024. Some 46% of hull damages were attributable to vessels which were 20 years or older. While the main solution will be a replacement of the aging vessels, some other short-term fixes can be applied. Regular maintenance of vessels and upgrades to equipment can reduce the risk of casualties, helping to prolong vessel lifespans in a safer way. Urgent need for better fire safety Of equal concern are the numbers of fire/explosions, which increased by 18% in 2024, and by 58% since 2014, with a disproportionately high amount (27%) coming from the passenger/ferry segment. As fire and explosions tend to have higher rates of injuries and fatalities, enhanced fire safety measures and emergency response training should be implemented on all vessels where this is deemed to be lacking. Decline in collision, foundering, and piracy incidents but sharp increase in war losses Putting these trends aside, the safety data does have some more promising stories to tell. Casualties involving collisions with another vessel, contact with a static object, foundering, and wrecked/stranded have decreased by 26% from 2014 – 2024. This is likely attributable to technological advancements in navigation systems, digital safety, route and weather planning, improved vessel design, stricter safety regulations, and data-driven risk management. Casualties involving piracy also fell over the last decade, with the overall trend showing a 48% decline. This is largely the result of sustained international cooperation which has led to improved maritime security practices, regional stabilization efforts, and the adoption of best management practices by shipping companies. In contrast, however, war loss incidents increased with yearly numbers ranging from zero to three until 2021 to 51 in 2024 due to ongoing political conflicts. This underscores the impact of geopolitical instability on maritime safety, highlighting the vulnerability of maritime operations in conflict zones. The rise in machinery-related casualties cuts across most vessel segments: A call to decision-makers While there are some glimmers of positivity, the overall trend in maritime safety is unmistakably negative. Shipowners and operators are urged to take action to mitigate todays and future risks. A steadily aging fleet is clearly driving an increase in the number of incidents, and it is incumbent on shipowners to mitigate this issue through better maintenance or other means. The adoption of new technologies and fuels is likely to be a growing factor in the years ahead and should be addressed from an early stage through the implementation of safe vessel designs, profound technical barriers, best practices and comprehensive, continuous training for all crew members.

Video: Gaza Flotilla Boat Struck by an Object in Tunisia Which Starts Fire,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-gaza-flotilla-boat-struck-by-an-object-which-starts-fire-in-tunisia,,09/09/2025 15:39:33,,"The organizers of the latest activist flotilla planning to sail to Gaza are reporting their vessel was struck by an object from the sky overnight, starting a small fire on deck. The group issued multiple videos while officials in Tunisia quickly rejected the claims of a drone attack. The group, which is calling its effort the Global Sumud Flotilla, has been preparing in the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said since Sunday. Shortly before midnight local time on Monday, September 8, the group reports it saw a drone overhead at a height of 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet), followed by an object falling from the drone and hitting the deck of the lead vessel of the flotilla. A fire ensued, which the group said was caused by lifejackets on deck. They said the deck and the under-deck storage on the vessel registered in Portugal were damaged, but none of the six people aboard were injured. Among the individuals reported to be traveling on the vessel named Family and registered in Maderia is Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Footage from another boat of our Flotilla shows the exact moment the Family Boat was struck from above. pic.twitter.com/qVpUyg56uP First footage reveals the damage to the Family vessel after it was struck by a drone at 11:45pm. pic.twitter.com/FpjUg9bjNs The incident coincided with the group's livestreaming reports. This morning, they held another press conference saying they are undeterred in their efforts to reach Gaza. Media reports are calling it a “luminous flying object,” while the group asserts the drone dropped a bomb onto their deck. Tunisia’s Ministry of Interior issued a statement saying that the reports circulated “about a drone crashing onto a ship docked at Sidi Bou Said Port are completely false.” According to their version of the events, security units inspected the effects of the fire, saying it broke out in one of the life jackets and was quickly brought under control. They reported that the fire did not cause any human or material damage, except for the burning of several of the life jackets. Since Sunday, boats that departed from Barcelona, Spain, and Genoa, Italy, have been massing in the Tunisian port. Organizers claim there are around 50 boats and activists representing 44 countries. They had previously been delayed by bad weather, but the current plan is to set sail on Wednesday. They hope to overwhelm the Israeli blockade, although reports from Israel show the navy staging exercises off Gaza. Another effort in July with a single vessel was intercepted by the Israelis as it attempted to approach the coast and was escorted to port. The individuals aboard, including Greta Thunberg, were deported. The first attempt was preparing off Malta in May when the group also claimed that its vessel was attacked by drones. The authorities in Malta aided with the firefight and reported minor damage to the vessel, which caused an end to the effort. Organizers during their press event today asserted that a total of 37 boats have either been intercepted or turned away attempting to reach Gaza over the past 17 years. The Israelis have permitted international organizations to deliver aid from Cyprus and elsewhere under controlled conditions.",Maritime Executive,09/09/2025 21:26:41

Netherlands Fights Shadow Fleet's Use of Fake Caribbean Flags,https://maritime-executive.com/article/netherlands-fights-shadow-fleet-s-use-of-fake-caribbean-flags,,10/09/2025 00:17:07,,"Dutch authorities are taking steps to challenge ""shadow fleet"" tankers that pretend to operate under the flags of island states in the Netherlands Antilles. According to the Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners (KVNR), several dozen tankers are flying the flags of Aruba, Sint Maarten and Curacao at any given time, though the roster changes regularly (consistent with the ""flag-hopping"" practices seen in the shadow fleet). Aruba and Sint Maarten show up often on the AIS broadcasts and paperwork of shadow fleet ships, but in reality these small nations do not operate registries at all. And Curacao, which does have a shipping registry, has not registered any of the shadow fleet tankers. ""The KVNR considers the flying of fraudulent flags to be very damaging to the reputation of the Netherlands and Curaçao,"" said the KVNR in a recent statement. KVNR called for Dutch authorities to enforce the rules within Dutch waters, since shadow fleet tankers pass by the Netherlands all the time. It also went a step further: it noted that international law ""seems to allow for action even on the high seas against stateless ships"" - a category that includes any Aruban- or Sint Maarten-flagged ship. Coastal and port states could take similar steps to enforce the law aboard stateless vessels. In Curacao, officials have called for foreign port state control officials to take action against tankers flying the Curacao flag, and to pursue criminal charges, according to the local Curacao Chronicle. The outlet reports that the Dutch government is taking the matter seriously and challenging fraudulently-registered vessels wherever possible. Dutch coast guard assets intercepted two vessels flying Aruban flags through the Dutch EEZ in August, but did not board them. Inspections of false Antilles-flagged tankers are expected when such vessels are at anchor in Dutch waters, the Chronicle reported. The shadow fleet has expanded rapidly amidst tightening Western sanctions on Russia, and it has shifted towards the use of less-legitimate and nonexistent flag states, as the larger open registries have become wary of the compliance risks of associating with the trade. When including smaller sub-fleets serving Iran and Venezuela, the estimates of the shadow fleet's size range as high as about 900 vessels, per one measure published by S&P Global - up to about 17 percent of all global tanker tonnage, most of it generally aging and underinsured.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 04:27:59
U.S. Container Imports Are Projected to Decline for the Remainder of 2025,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-container-imports-are-projected-to-decline-for-the-remainder-of-2025,,09/09/2025 22:35:38,,"The start of the U.S.’s reciprocal tariffs and the continued uncertainty over longer-term trade policies have begun to weigh on imports, report both the National Retail Federation and Descartes Systems Group, a software provider for logistics-intensive industries. The latest monthly forecasts highlight a peak in July with a steady decline forecasted for monthly import volumes in the remainder of 2025. “Retailers have stocked up as much as they can ahead of tariff increases, but the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy is making it impossible to make the long-term plans that are critical to future business success,” explains Jonathan Gold, the NRF’s Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy. “These tariffs and disruptions to the supply chain are adding costs that will ultimately lead to higher prices for American consumers.” The NRF, in its monthly Global Port Tracker, reports August volumes were likely down about 1.7 percent from a year ago and at a projected final total of 2.28 million TEU, off nearly 3.4 percent from the 2.38 million TEU in July. They note that July was up 20 percent over June, making it the second-busiest month on record as retailers brought merchandise in ahead of the August start of reciprocal tariffs and a looming deadline for tariffs on China. Total container imports at U.S. seaports measured by Descartes were at 2.52 million TEU in August, which it says was up 1.6 percent year-over-year. However, it points to a nearly 4 percent year-over-year decline, highlighting the impact of “fast-shifting trade policy.” The biggest year-over-year drops came in aluminum, apparel, and footwear, reports Descartes. It notes that furniture, toys, and electrical machinery imports also fell in August. It warns that “policy remains the wildcard.” Imports are uncertain after Trump doubled the tariffs on India to a total of 50 percent at the end of August. Further, while the deadline for a trade deal with China was pushed back a further 90 days to November 10, it looms over imports. With the delay coming as retailers head into the busiest season of the year, the NRF actually raised its forecast slightly from last month. The forecast for September calls for the strongest increase, with NRF forecasting 2.12 million TEU, up from its prior forecast of 1.83 million TEU. However, it sees an accelerating month decline as imports move into the fourth quarter of 2025. It expects volumes will level off at just over 1.7 million TEU per month in November and December. For the full year, the NRF forecasts imports of 24.7 million TEU, which would be down 3.4 percent from 2024. It, however, will still be the fourth-highest year on record, following the peaks during the pandemic and in 2024. The retailers also released their first forecast for 2026, projecting that January will be at 1.8 million TEU. They expect the new year to start at a level 19 percent below January 2025.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 04:27:59
Stemming the Tide of War Insurance Costs,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/stemming-the-tide-of-war-insurance-costs,,09/09/2025 22:30:04,,"War risk insurance costs have soared by up to 60% thanks to recent escalated Middle East tensions. Is this increase surprising? No. Is it substantial? Yes. The increase reflects heightened volatility in regions like the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, particularly around the Strait of Hormuz. For instance, premiums in the Strait area rose from approximately 0.125% to 0.2–0.4% of a ship’s hull and machinery (H&M) value, translating to hefty increases. Meanwhile, vessels servicing the broader Middle East Gulf have seen premiums climb from 0.2–0.3% up to 0.5%, adding extra daily costs for VLCCs. And, although a recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran eased rates slightly, dropping back to the high 0.35–0.45% range, the volatility persists. Saleem Khan, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Pole Star Global provides his view on the strategies that charterers, brokers and shippers should consider as they strive to reduce the impact of war insurance costs on their respective organizations. Prioritize Reputable and Transparent Counterparties One critical strategy is to work exclusively with known, transparent entities. In a climate where war risk premiums are heavily influenced by perceptions of geopolitical exposure, not just by voyage routes, partnering with opaque or sanctions-linked firms can cause underwriters to hike premiums or withdraw cover altogether. Misaligned ownership can implicate unwitting funding to watch?listed actors. Leverage Beneficial Owner Data Tools The digitization and digitalization of various processes and systems across the maritime sector is increasingly prevalent and powerful. This is providing the sector with valuable data and insights upon which to make better decisions for charterers, brokers, shippers and crew. For example, by using sophisticated and proven maritime intelligence platforms it is possible for the sector to attain detailed ownership and beneficial owner intelligence. This kind of visibility enables charterers and brokers to verify their vessel source chain, avoid inadvertent support of illicit actors, and gain underwriters’ confidence—potentially securing lower premiums. Embrace Dynamic Route Management & Risk Intelligence War risk ratings now shift weekly, even daily in response to geopolitical changes. Leveraging real?time intelligence about these developments and changes – including vessel tracking, GNSS jamming alerts, and regional risk analytics – can help avoid costly detours while vessels travel and further insurance upcharges. Opt for Bundled Premiums & Fleet Discounts Underwriters sometimes offer fleet-based packages or longer?period bundling, reducing the per?voyage cost even in volatile zones. Such arrangements can soften steep premium hikes, especially for operators with multiple vessels. Therefore, it’s worth exploring these options. Integrate Cyber & War Risk Coverage The modern maritime threat landscape, marked by AIS spoofing, GNSS jamming, and cyber?based vessel interference, demands integrated insurance policies that combine war risk with cybersecurity cover. This ensures comprehensive protection against evolving maritime threats. War risk premiums are climbing. They are staying elevated due to both physical route hazards and the shadow of sanctions, watchlists, and intermediary integrity. Charterers and brokers can stem the tide and control their exposure, not just by re-routing their vessels and shipments; but by enhancing transparency, deploying forensic ownership data, and actively managing voyages with intelligence-backed insights and smart underwriting strategies.

Warnings of Recent Spike in Off-Spec Marine Fuels Including VLSFO in Europe,https://maritime-executive.com/article/warnings-of-recent-spike-in-off-spec-marine-fuels-including-vlsfo-in-europe,,09/09/2025 21:34:53,,"There are renewed quality concerns for the most popular marine fuels, and especially for very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) used by many vessels to meet emission requirements. A range of sediments and impurities raises concerns not only of accelerated wear but also clogs and failures of critical components in the fuel system that can cause unplanned stoppages or blackouts. “Bunkering with off-spec fuel continues to be a real issue,” says David Fuhlbrügge, Managing Director, CM Technologies, a condition monitoring company. “The transition from traditional fuel oils to VLSFO has created ongoing problems for ship operators, with fuel quality issues becoming a persistent concern across major bunkering hubs since the introduction of the fuel more than ten years ago.” One market analyst they point out reported in January 2025 that more than 45 percent of the global VLSFO supply does not meet ISO standards. CMT says that independent data in the second quarter showed a further increase, with more than half of all VLSFO samples tested off-spec due to excessive sediment. Issues include poor blending and barge contamination. Leading independent agencies, Bureau Veritas, VeriFuel, VPS, and FOBAS, have indicated that the problem is especially concerning in Europe. With their reports showing higher than expected levels of catalytic fines, sediments, and or viscosity issues. In Skagen, Norway, for example. 84 percent of samples tested were off-spec, while in Piraeus, Greece, one-in-eight VLSFO deliveries were off-spec. The reports highlight concerns in the busy corridor between Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp. CMT says wax formation when low viscosity VLSFO is stored in temperatures above 21 degrees C is a particular problem. “VLSFO is a persistent problem for ship managers and charterers,” says Fuhlbrügge. “Operators must know exactly what is going into their tanks. Effective monitoring onboard and at the bunkering port is the only way to protect machinery, safeguard operations, and preserve reliability.” The company highlights that catalytic fines in particular present an immediate threat to critical components, acting like microscopic sandpaper on injectors and pumps. Sediment, sludge, and wax formation increase the risk of clogged filters and purifiers, while abnormally high viscosity disrupts combustion and raises fuel consumption. Inconsistent fuel quality can rapidly undermine even the most carefully planned maintenance schedules and compromise a vessel’s emissions performance. CMT warns of the consequences of poor or non-existent monitoring. It says on-site testing capabilities are a critical tool for crews that can assess fuel quality before it enters an engine. Fuel purity is a consistent concern for ship operators. There have been several cases in Houston that raised concern, and a serious situation in Singapore in 2022. More than 200 vessels were impacted when more than $120 million in fuel was found to have impurities. The following year, another 32 vessels reported problems in an incident that started in Houston and spread to Singapore.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 04:27:59
Bridging Land and Sea: FMSDI and the Future of Coastal Insight,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/bridging-land-and-sea-fmsdi-and-the-future-of-coastal-insight,,09/09/2025 21:03:09,,"Coasts are places of convergence. They are where ships meet ports, where cities meet tides, and where human infrastructure must coexist with dynamic natural forces. They are also where our data systems often fall apart. On land, survey agencies and municipalities maintain elevation models, cadastral records, and infrastructure maps. At sea, hydrographic offices chart depths, currents, and hazards. Each operates in its own world, with its own standards, coordinate systems, and governance. At the shoreline—the “white ribbon,” as some hydrographers call it—these systems collide. The result is uncertainty precisely where clarity matters most. For centuries, mariners coped with charts that ended at the low-water mark, while land surveyors mapped shorelines as static boundaries. In the age of climate change and globalized trade, those divisions no longer suffice. Storm surges, rising seas, and shifting coastlines demand integrated models of land and sea. Ports and shipping require seamless data to manage traffic, dredging, and safety. Coastal communities need accurate, shared information to plan resilience. This is the story of the Federated Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure (FMSDI) initiative: a global effort to connect the worlds of land and sea through shared data, common standards, and federated access. The White Ribbon Problem The “white ribbon” is more than a metaphor. It is the literal band on digital maps where land-based elevation models and marine bathymetric charts fail to meet. This happens because each domain uses different vertical reference systems—mean sea level on land, chart datums at sea. Coordinate systems don’t always align. Surveys occur at different times and resolutions. For a port authority, this might mean not knowing exactly where dredging is needed. For a shipping company, it can mean uncertainty about safe approach depths. For emergency planners, it can mean blind spots in storm surge modeling. For coastal managers, it complicates habitat mapping and climate resilience planning. In short: fragmented data creates fragmented decisions. A Federated Approach Rather than building one massive system, OGC and its partners launched FMSDI in 2021 to test a federated model. The premise is simple: agencies and operators should keep control of their own data but connect them through open standards so they can be discovered, accessed, and integrated in real time. By Phase 5 in 2024, the initiative had grown into a collaboration among the UK Hydrographic Office, NOAA, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Natural Resources Canada, Singapore Land Authority and Maritime Port Authority, Esri, Hexagon, TCarta, and others. The pilots aimed to do two things: develop best practices for interoperability at the land–sea interface; and demonstrate live, technical solutions that show how integration can work in practice. Demonstrations that Made it Real The pilots produced three compelling technology showcases. Compusult built unified operational pictures that combined terrestrial elevation, bathymetry, and tidal data. In The Solent (UK) and Chesapeake Bay (USA), the system showed how vessels could be routed based on current tidal conditions and combined topographic-bathymetric models. The result: safer, more efficient navigation in dynamic coastal environments. Pangaea Innovations applied a 4D Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) to index data across space and time. This approach allowed direct queries across terrestrial and marine datasets without complex harmonization. For port operations, this means infrastructure and navigation data can be analyzed together through a single framework. TCarta demonstrated satellite-derived shoreline monitoring. By tying vectors to tidal states, they produced near real-time updates of where the coast actually is. This provides a scalable, cost-effective way to keep intertidal models current—a critical need as sea-level rise accelerates shoreline change. All demonstrations were anchored in OGC APIs and IHO S-100 standards, ensuring that the work could plug into existing GIS and marine information systems. Why This Matters for the Maritime World These demonstrations may sound technical, but their implications are far-reaching: Five Best Practices Emerging from FMSDI The pilots distilled their lessons into five principles that any maritime nation or organization can adopt: International Momentum FMSDI is not operating in a vacuum. It aligns with global efforts such as: By grounding its work in frameworks like IGIF, IGIF-Hydro, and S-100, FMSDI ensures that the solutions tested locally can scale internationally and contribute directly to global goals for resilience, sustainability, and efficiency. Looking Ahead The shoreline is not static, and neither is the FMSDI initiative. The next phases will focus on: The vision is clear: a global fabric of federated marine and terrestrial datasets that can support resilience, efficiency, and innovation. A Coastline of Possibility The white ribbon once represented a barrier. Today, it represents an opportunity. By bridging land and sea through federated approaches, we can transform fragmented data into a foundation for smarter navigation, safer coasts, and more resilient communities. The Federated Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure initiative shows that technical obstacles can be overcome, agencies and companies can collaborate, and open standards can provide the glue. For the maritime sector, this is more than a technical breakthrough. It is a path to greater trust, efficiency, and foresight in a world where the coast is never still. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) continues to coordinate this work with hydrographic offices, space agencies, research institutions, and industry partners worldwide. Dr. Ingo Simonis, Ph.D. is CTO of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

Maersk Declares General Average After Container Fire Aboard Marie Maersk,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-declares-general-average-after-container-fire-aboard-marie-maersk,,09/09/2025 20:18:01,,"The containership Marie Maersk is still making its way to Malaysia after fighting a box fire, and now the carrier reports it has declared General Average. Maersk is using the well-established law to share the cost of the firefight, which required bringing in additional resources but appears to have limited the scope of damage to the vessel and its cargo. The carrier has not provided details on the extent of the damage on the vessel, which carries over 19,000 TEU. Pictures from one of the supply vessels that aided the Marie Maersk while it was off the coast of Africa did not show fire damage. Maersk had previously said that the full extent of the damage would only be known once the boxes were offloaded and inspected. “We have declared General Average (GA) and have already asked affected cargo owners/customers to submit the respective securities for a fast cargo release,” a company spokesperson told The Maritime Executive. Cargo claims consultant WK Webster is informing customers that it believes Maersk intends to discharge the entire cargo of the vessel in Malaysia. The ship had been scheduled to proceed to China. Webster advises that General Average security will be required from all cargo interests before the delivery of their cargo. It has cargo surveyors standing by and fire experts to investigate the cause of the fire. Maersk reported that the crew of the ship spotted smoke on August 13 and began firefighting procedures. They were working to keep the situation under control while external firefighting support was being organized. Initially, two tugboats with firefighting equipment reached the ship off Liberia, and within days, they reported the spread of the fire had been contained. An expert firefighting team boarded the vessel on August 19, and the decision was then made to resume the voyage. The ship is expected to arrive at the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in Malaysia with the current ETA of September 14. Maersk and the insurance companies are planning an investigation into the cause of the fire. While the causes of the fire on the Maersk ship are still unknown, the dangers of mis-declared and improperly packed cargo were highlighted in a new report from the World Shipping Council. Analyzing data from port state inspections in seven locations, the trade group reported inspectors had identified problems in 11.39 percent of containers (8,850 containers out of 77,688 inspected). The most frequent issues were with documentation, placarding, and labeling, but they also reported issues in about a third of the cases with stowage or securing freight in the containers, as well as a smaller number of cases of inappropriate or damaged packaging.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 04:27:59

According to the last report from the Coast Guard, at least 67 containers are in the harbor, but there were no reports of injuries. The containership Mississippi (65,968 dwt) arrived from Yantian, China, early this morning, September 9, at the terminal. It is unclear if cargo operations had begun, but an emission capture barge from STAX was already alongside. The Coast Guard reports the barge was damaged. Many of the containers floating in the harbor were from Zim. Pictures show a stack collapse in the last bay at the stern of the vessel and an additional collapse midship on the starboard side. Some of the boxes have landed on the barge, while others are in the water. Local TV news reports indicated they appeared to be spraying water with high-power hoses possibly to stop the boxes from drifting in the harbor and a harbor boat was seen nudging some of the containers. The official reports said it was unclear what was in the containers. TV reports said they have seen apparel and shoes floating in the harbor.

MAIB: Fishing Vessel Foundered off Falklands Due to Failed Shell Door,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maib-fishing-vessel-foundered-off-falklands-due-to-failed-shell-door,,09/09/2025 18:22:34,,"The UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch has released a report on the sinking of the fishing vessel Argos Georgia, which went down off the coast of the Falkland Islands in 2024 with the loss of 13 lives. On July 21, 2024, the 2018-built fishing vessel Argos Georgia got underway from Port Stanley, Falkland Islands and headed out to her fishing grounds with 27 crewmembers on board. On Monday afternoon, she reported a serious flooding incident at a position about 200 miles to the east of the port. As rescue assets mobilized to the scene, the situation on board deteriorated, and the crew was forced to abandon ship into their life rafts. The vessel sank after they departed. Some of the vessel's crew were lost at sea during the abandon-ship evolution, and some of the evacuees passed away due to exposure in the liferafts while waiting for a rescue. Ultimately 14 out of 27 survived and were returned to shore. MAIB launched an investigation into the cause of the sinking, and quickly focused in on problems with the shell door (exterior hatch) within the hauling compartment for the trawler's nets. CCTV cameras captured footage of the shell door closed in its elevated position, then slowly descending, allowing water to flood into the compartment. Once opened, the door was too difficult for crewmembers to close, and water flowed freely in. The hatches from the hauling compartment into the interior of the vessel were also open, and the water poured inside, putting Argos Georgia into a significant list and leading to progressive downflooding. The MAIB swiftly turned around an interim warning to all fishing vessel operators to check on their side shell doors and evaluate the risk of shell door failure - including the risk of progressive flooding through hatches and penetrations into other compartments. MAIB also launched an evaluation of Argos Georgia's shell door design, using finite element analysis engineering. The review found an ""unacceptable level of stress and potential failure of the shell door drive shaft, coupling and key"" during operations. If the opening/closing mechanism failed during operation, there was no backstop and the door would lower to the open position. In July, MAIB recommended that the designer revise this design and share the findings with other vessel operators that have similar shell doors installed. The final report's findings are coming soon.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 04:27:59
German Police Detain and Search Cargo Ship on Suspicion of Spying,https://maritime-executive.com/article/german-police-detain-and-search-cargo-ship-on-suspicion-of-spying,,09/09/2025 18:07:20,,"German police in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein confirmed media reports that they boarded a cargo ship on the suspicion that it was being used for launching drones and spying on critical infrastructure. It is the second incident this year when a vessel has been searched as part of the ongoing reports of drones spotted overflying critical infrastructure and military installations in Northern Europe. The Scanlark, a 2,000 dwt North Sea cargo ship, according to the reports, was targeted, and the police trapped the vessel at the southern Kiel-Holtenau lock of the Kiel Canal on Sunday, September 7, at around 1600. The vessel, which is registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, was ordered to secure, and according to a report in Der Spiegel, a rubber police launch was circling the ship before special forces boarded the Scanlark. “The reason for this was to avert threats to Germany's critical maritime infrastructure and an ongoing investigation by the Flensburg Public Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of spying for the purposes of sabotage and security-threatening imaging,” the police and prosecutors said in a joint statement. “It is suspected that a drone was launched from the searched vessel on August 26, 2025, and controlled via a naval vessel in order to reconnoiter it and take photographs.” The Lower Saxony Interior Minister, Daniela Behrens, issued a statement saying the forces were working to “ward off hybrid threats and dangers to our security.” She repeated the accusation that the vessel was suspected of having served as a base for drone flights over critical infrastructure. The vessel, which was built in 2006 and is 247 feet (75 meters) in length, was reportedly searched while divers were sent down to inspect the hull. It was coming from Rotterdam with a reported destination of Finland. AIS signals show it is still at the Kiel Canal. The Estonian Public Broadcasting service’s ERR outlet is quoting the shipping company Vista Shipping Agency of Estonia, which operates the ship, calling the actions “stupidity.” They told ERR that the allegations of spying against Germany were “laughable” and “nonsense.” German authorities have been on heightened alert due to the tensions in the region. ERR reports that there were 536 suspicious drone flights logged near strategic infrastructure in Germany in the first three months of 2025. The police in their statement referred to the current situation as an ongoing investigation. German media previously reported in May that there were incidents where drones were spotted near a military site near Kiel, and 10 days later, a German patrol ship believed it was being followed by a drone. Another small cargo ship was identified as a suspect, and the police in Belgium were asked to search that vessel. After the incidents in the spring, the media reports said German authorities do not have the resources to properly track and identify the drones.

Her Majesty Queen Mary Names Denmark’s First Electric Tugboat,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/her-majesty-queen-mary-names-denmark-s-first-electric-tugboat,,10/09/2025 01:14:05,,"[By: Svitzer] The green transition in Denmark’s maritime sector took an important step forward today as Denmark’s – and Svitzer’s – first electric tugboat was named by Her Majesty Queen Mary at a ceremony in Copenhagen. The new tugboat will carry the name Svitzer Ingrid, as announced by Her Majesty during the naming ceremony, which was attended by more than 100 executives from the Danish maritime industry. Svitzer Ingrid has a battery capacity equivalent to that of 23 modern electric cars and can perform most tasks using electricity, thereby reducing annual CO? emissions by 600 to 900 tonnes. “At Svitzer, we have an ambition to become climate neutral by 2040, so today marks an important milestone for us. The electrification of our vessels is a key part of achieving this target. Svitzer Ingrid will operate in the Sound with Helsingborg as its home port, and around 90% of all tasks can be completed using electricity,” said Kasper Friis Nilaus, CEO of Svitzer. Svitzer operates a fleet of over 450 tugboats - assisting large tankers, container ships, and cruise vessels safely in and out of ports. Ingrid is Svitzer’s first fully battery-powered tugboat. A second electric tugboat has been ordered for delivery in 2026, and Svitzer is also in the market for additional four electric tugboats. Since 2016, Svitzer has operated four hybrid tugs in Australia. “We would like to make a larger share of our fleet battery-powered, but this depends on ports having the necessary charging infrastructure. We are not there yet, although we see positive progress,” added Kasper Friis Nilaus. “Ultimately, ports will need charging infrastructure similar to that for cars. Shipping companies cannot achieve this on their own. We must work together across our industry, with policymakers and local communities, to develop viable green solutions,” he said. Svitzer Ingrid will be recharged using renewable energy supply at the Port of Helsingborg. Facts about Svitzer Ingrid: Svitzer vessels in Scandinavia are named after figures from Nordic mythology, and the Svitzer Ingrid is no exception. The name also carries a royal reference to Queen Ingrid. This is the second time that H.M. Queen Mary has named a Svitzer vessel, having previously named Svitzer Marysville in Melbourne, Australia in 2011.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 09:30:27

"Strike on Venezuelan Smuggling Boat Draws Praise, But Also Concerns",https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/strike-on-venezuelan-smuggling-boat-draws-cheers-but-also-concern,,10/09/2025 01:54:52,,"The U.S. military strike that destroyed a suspected smuggling boat off Venezuela last week was different from past practice: it was more muscular than law enforcement interdiction, sending a lethal message for deterrence - and some in the region, like Trinidad Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, are very supportive. But for some inside and outside the Pentagon, it also raises new legal questions. The recent dismissal of Rear Adm. Milton “Jamie” Sands III, head of Naval Special Warfare Command, may have been related to Sands' concern about the legality of impending strikes in the Caribbean, several government officials told The Intercept; other officials warned of a chilling effect in the ranks of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, which may be preventing internal dissent. According to the Pentagon, the attack last Tuesday killed 11 people aboard a go-fast boat. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the occupants were engaged in smuggling and were under way for Trinidad and Tobago, a typical short-haul drug route for the Venezuelan cocaine export trade. The destruction of the boat was not a one-off: Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged that ""it won't stop with just this strike,"" a message echoed by Rubio. Both asserted that the shipment was for Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan cartel that the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Critics of the strike have highlighted several factors that stand out. The boat's occupants did not stand trial, nor was it clear if they were given the option to surrender. The alleged offense, drug smuggling, is not punishable by death in the United States for those who are convicted. Inside the Pentagon and among some former military lawyers, these factors have created unease, and some have quietly questioned whether such a strike might be a crime under the laws of war. ""Drug traffickers may be criminals but they aren’t combatants,"" a high-ranking Pentagon official told The Intercept. Even if legal, others highlight that it might not be desirable, simply because it sets an example that America's adversaries could follow too. ""The United States argues that its model of courts, directed by evidence that is weighed at trial, sets it apart from authoritarian regimes. A policy of execution at sea would undermine that claim,"" wrote attorney Annie W. Morgan and submarine officer Lt. Cmdr. James Halsell for USNI Proceedings this week. ""If Washington claims the right to strike suspected traffickers abroad, what prevents Russia or China from doing the same? Would the United States accept Beijing launching a missile at a Taiwanese fishing vessel it accuses of 'smuggling' under Chinese law?"" In the meantime, the administration is moving ahead with forceful action in the Caribbean. In addition to the amphib USS Iwo Jima and her escorts, the White House has ordered 10 F-35 fighters to deploy to Puerto Rico to reinforce the task force. ""We are going to take on drug cartels wherever they are, wherever they are operating against the interests of the US,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 15:41:12

"Metal Workers Launch Strike With ""High-Altitude Sit-In"" at Hyundai Shipyard",https://maritime-executive.com/article/metal-workers-launch-strike-with-high-altitude-sit-in-at-hyundai-shipyard,,10/09/2025 15:51:45,,"The protracted annual wage negotiations between the Metal Workers Union and HD Hyundai for its shipyards are continuing without an agreement, while the union called management’s negotiations “insincere.” Workers at the three shipyards in South Korea staged a partial strike on September 10, with reports that they will begin a general strike starting on the 11th, which is likely to further impact production at the yards. To demonstrate the union’s frustration with the slow pace of the talks, the branch head of the union, Baekho-seon, began a “50-meter-high sit-in.” On the morning of the 10th, coinciding with the start of a seven-hour strike at the yard, the head of the union branch climbed the yard’s 164-foot-tall crane used to move blocks. He emphasized the lack of progress and no new offers from management for the wage negotiations while urging management “to make a decision.” Workers at the HD Hyundai Heavy Industries’ yard were on strike for the day, while union members at the HD Hyundai Mipo and Samho yards stopped work in the afternoon. Reports said there have been between 10 and 20 negotiating sessions since May and that the union staged seven partial strikes at HHI and more than 10 at all the facilities, and now will move to a full strike. The union branch head climbed the key crane and banners have been unfurled (Metal Workers Union) Baekho-seon called the wage demands “completely justified” and said they are “neither excessive nor unusual compared to the company’s ability to pay.” The talks have reportedly been stalled with no new offer from management since union members in mid-July rejected a tentative agreement. The union asserted that the workers “are not being treated with respect or compensated” for their role in helping to elevate the yards’ importance with the Make American Shipbuilding Great (MASGA) initiative. The union rejected the tentative agreement which called for an increase in base pay of approximately $100 and a $3,800 bonus. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, the holding company for the shipbuilding operations, reported on September 8 that it has received orders for a total of 86 ships worth $11.75 billion so far in 2025, achieving 65 percent of its annual order target of $18.05 billion. Media reports, however, indicate that the union's partial strikes and now the sit-in on the critical crane are impacting production. As part of its protests, union members have also used motorcycles on the main roads to slow or stop the movement of blocks and equipment. Tensions with the union also increased after the company announced plans to merge the shipyards in Ulsan, with Mipo becoming an offshoot of HHI. The union fears job transfers and reassignments after the merger. It has threatened to oppose the merger and the MASGA initiative, which was a key part of the trade and tariff negotiations between the Koreans and the Trump administration.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 21:29:07
Gaza-Bound Flotilla Reports Second Attack and Fire as It Prepares to Sail,https://maritime-executive.com/article/gaza-bound-flotilla-reports-second-attack-and-fire-as-it-prepares-to-sail,,10/09/2025 14:11:26,,"The activist group calling its efforts the Global Sumud Flotilla, released a video showing a second incident on one of its vessels in Tunisia, apparently involving an incendiary device dropped from above. The group insists that it is undeterred and will set sail understanding the dangers as it attempts to break the blockade on Gaza. The video released by the group shows a device being dropped onto the deck of their vessel and people yelling fire. The report said there were no injuries and only minor fire damage to the deck of the vessel named Alma. Reported to have a length of 108 feet (33 meters) and registered in the UK, it is said to be one of the largest vessels in the flotilla. The group asserts in its statement today that Alma was attacked on the evening of September 9, approximately 24 hours after the first incident with the vessel named Family. In last night’s incident, they are saying an “unlit drone released an object that ignited the deck of the Alma boat. Experts believe it may have been an incendiary device coated with fuel-soaked materials, deliberately designed to spark fire upon impact.” They report the fire was extinguished on the Alma. The passengers and crew are reported to be safe. The organizers contend that Israel is organizing activities to “distract and derail our mission.” BREAKING: A second assault on the Global Sumud Flotilla within just 48 hours—this time in Tunisian waters.

The tracking system shows 20 boats in two locations in Tunisia, but as of late on Wednesday, they are not yet underway. The group said it was timing the departure based on weather and logistical conditions. Yesterday, it reported a similar incident with a boat named Family, homeported in Madeira. It was also in the anchorage in Tunisia’s Sidi Bou Said port when a fire started on the forward deck. The group released a video showing something being dropped from above, saying that it was another drone that had attacked. Damage was limited to the area and lifejackets stored on deck. Tunisian officials yesterday denied that the incident on Monday was a drone attack and only commented on the fire. Reuters reports that the ministry has not responded to requests today for a comment about the latest incident.",Maritime Executive,10/09/2025 21:29:07

"Davie Unveils Plans for $1B ""Icebreaker Factory"" in Galveston",https://maritime-executive.com/article/davie-unveils-plans-for-1b-icebreaker-factory-in-galveston,,10/09/2025 22:35:40,,"An American affiliate of Canadian shipbuilder Davie has released its first detailed plans for a proposed ""American Icebreaker Factory"" at the Gulf Copper yard in Galveston, Texas. The budget for construction is in the range of $1 billion, according to Davie, and the facility would be purpose-built for delivering on the Trump administration's icebreaker procurement priorities. The renderings appear to show at least half a dozen new assembly bays, along with a new apron of reclaimed land along the waterfront. Four existing finger piers at the Gulf Copper facility appear to be removed in the rendering, replaced by two shiplifts. Davie also owns Finland's Mantyluoto Shipyard and Helsinki Shipyard; the latter is a leader in medium icebreaker construction, and built a substantial share of Russia's non-nuclear icebreaking fleet. Under Davie's ownership, Helsinki is providing its expertise in design and construction for Canada's heavy icebreaker acquisition programs, as well as Davie's pitch for the U.S. Coast Guard. Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Coast Guard has an unprecedented budget for shipbuilding, including $3.5 billion for medium icebreakers. The caveat is that the service needs to spend it fast: the Coast Guard has been soliciting information from U.S. and foreign shipyards for an ""Arctic Security Cutter"" that could deliver within three years of an order signing, in time for the first vessel to enter service during President Donald Trump's current term. Since no American yard has delivered a full size icebreaker in a generation, and the only icebreaker program under contract is years behind schedule, all of the options reportedly under consideration involve foreign construction - or at minimum, foreign partnership. ""Recapitalization of the nation’s icebreaker fleet and closing the shipbuilding gap with China are now clear national priorities,"" Kai Skvarla, CEO of Davie Defense. Davie Defense has plans to refit the leased Gulf Copper yard in Galveston, and (if it secures a Coast Guard contract) could support as many as 2,000 people at the site and more than 7,000 statewide. If that occurs, the economic impact across Texas is estimated at $9 billion.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45
Deal Finalized to Save Oregon’s Only International Container Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/deal-finalized-to-save-oregon-s-only-international-container-terminal,,10/09/2025 21:53:12,,"After more than 15 months of effort, the Port of Portland (Oregon) has completed a long-term agreement for the operation of Terminal 6, which is the state’s only active international container terminal. The port had announced in early 2024 that it planned to close the terminal due to mounting financial losses and the collapse of negotiations for a private operator. ""Scores of businesses throughout Oregon rely on Terminal 6 to ship their goods,"" said Governor Tina Kotek, who played a critical role by providing interim financing and state support to keep the terminal operating. ""Oregon communities will be better off because we came together and worked toward this shared goal."" While it is located more than 100 miles from the ocean, the port plays a vital role in the state’s agricultural and seafood sectors. Without the port, they would have had to truck goods through other ports, raising costs. However, in 20214, with high fixed operating costs, loss of a rail service partner, BNSF, that had provided a connection to Seattle and Tacoma, and collapse of negotiations for a potential private operator, the port authority said it had no choice but to begin winding down the operation. It was pointed out that the Columbia River is shallow, limiting the size of vessels that can reach the port. In addition, it is a relatively small consumer market. “The Port of Portland is the gateway connecting our farms, small businesses, and manufacturers to global markets,” noted Representative Shelly Boshart Davis. The Port has been rebuilding container service since 2018 and was working to secure a private operating partner, highlighting that Terminal 6 is an important piece of Oregon’s economic infrastructure. California-based Harbor Industrial, which had been providing stevedoring services, reached a tentative agreement last December to become the operator. The company will lease the 200-acre facility from the port authority for an initial seven-year term. It also has four options to extend the lease for a total of 20 years. Harbor has agreed to purchase seven new cranes for the terminal and will pay the port rent based on the amount of cargo it moves through the port. It will take over both the container and breakbulk operations at Terminal 6 as of December 31. In June, Oregon legislators also approved $20 million recommended by Governor Tina Kotek for necessary capital improvements at the terminal. The port and Harbor Industrial report they are committed to maintaining the significant benefits of shipping goods through Oregon ports. The port released a long-term plan that calls for doubling the size of the operation, and together they said they look forward to continued operations and growth of the container terminal.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45
Croatia Marks Opening of New Rijeka Terminal as a Gateway for the Region,https://maritime-executive.com/article/croatia-marks-opening-of-new-rijeka-terminal-as-a-gateway-for-the-region,,10/09/2025 21:07:43,,"Officials gathered in the Port of Rijeka, Croatia, to mark the arrival of the first commercial container vessel as the port transitioned from trial operations. Rijeka Gateway, they reported, represents the largest private investment in logistics in Croatia, and it becomes the most modern and technologically advanced container terminal in the region. The concession for the new terminal was awarded in November 2021, creating a joint venture between Maersk’s APM Terminals and ENNA Group. Croatia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure, Oleg Butkovi?, highlights that it was the largest agreement in the history of the Port of Rijeka. Maersk committed to a €380 million ($445 million) investment for the operations, which have been under construction for the past two years. It includes a 400-meter (1,300-foot) quay, which was in part financed with a World Bank loan, along with construction of access and internal roads, a new intermodal terminal, and rail interface. The terminal will have an initial annual capacity of 650,000 TEU, and they are also making investments in hinterland and terminal equipment. “This terminal is more than just infrastructure. It is a symbol of Rijeka as a modern, sustainable, and technologically advanced port that creates value and drives both the local and national economy,” said Peter Corfitsen, CEO of Rijeka Gateway. Emphasizing its role as a regional center, the Rijeka Gateway Terminal is being included in the new Gemini Cooperation between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd. It becomes part of the route linking ports in East Asia with locations in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea. The first commercial vessel to berth at Rijeka Gateway was Al Jasrah (157,374 dwt). Built in 2016, the vessel is registered in Liberia and operated by Hapag-Lloyd. It has a capacity of approximately 15,000 TEU. It was arriving from Port Said, Egypt. After a planned expansion, the port will grow to 680 meters (2,230 feet) of quay and a capacity of over one million TEU. The terminal is equipped with four remotely operated ship-to-shore cranes (STS), 15 rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTG), two rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMG), and 28 terminal tractors. All systems are integrated into a single control center, and terminal operations will be managed with cutting-edge technology, full automation, and renewable energy, making Rijeka Gateway the first terminal of its kind in the Adriatic region.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45

Jey Gonzalez-Diaz (aka Jeremy Diaz) was caught by Customs and Border Protection officers near the Port of San Juan, where Rhapsody of the Seas was unloading passengers. He has been charged with trying to avoid reporting currency while entering the U.S., by intentionally jumping over the side. The suspect was rescued by jet-skiiers and brought to safety,then arrested. The officers who searched him found nearly $15,000 in cash on his person, along with five different ID documents - one apparently belonging to his brother - and two mobile phones. He allegedly told officers at the scene that he was trying to get past customs so that he wouldn't have to declare the cash and pay duties on it. Royal Caribbean, operator of Rhapsody of the Seas, reportedly told CBP that Gonzalez-Diaz owed nearly $17,000 for his onboard activities, almost all of it for casino expenditures. The cruise line declined to comment further. Gonzalez-Diaz has been released on bail. If convicted, he could face a fine of up to $250,000 and five years in prison.

Port of Long Beach Resumes Operations After Container Collapse,https://maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-long-beach-resumes-operations-after-container-collapse,,10/09/2025 19:38:20,,"The Port of Long Beach, California, is reporting that all its terminals have resumed operations a day after the dramatic container collapse on a berthed vessel. Pier G, where the vessel Mississippi is berthed, is open and operating except for the immediate area around the vessel. In a statement issued on Wednesday, a day after the collapse, the Port of Long Beach now reports that there was one minor injury tied to the incident. They avoided a worse situation, especially with the emissions barge that was alongside and attached to the containership when some of the containers collapsed onto the barge. The U.S. Coast Guard reports the barge sustained damage. Other containers collapsed onto the dock alongside the ship. Additional videos have been released showing the sequence of events. After the first collapse, it appears the area around the vessel had been roped off for safety before the subsequent collapse. The situation continued with additional boxes that had been hanging from the ship also giving way and falling overboard. Video footage of containers falling from vessel Mississippi taken by @uscg Sector LA-LB Incident Management Division while on scene. #longbeach #vesselmississippi #polb #uscg pic.twitter.com/bAMNlhDUFB The Unified Command for the incident, which consists of federal, state, and local agencies, is working to ensure the recovery of the cargo containers. The Coast Guard raised the estimated number of 75 containers from the 67 it reported yesterday. Sonar surveys are being conducted to locate approximately 25 to 30 containers submerged in the harbor to ensure the safe navigation of ship traffic. The Coast Guard is maintaining a 500-yard safety zone, and a salvage plan is being developed and will be implemented as soon as possible. The port has clarified that the manifest shows shoes, apparel, furniture, and electronics as the cargo. The vessel operates one of Zim’s express services, making only four port calls: Vietnam, China, and California. TV reports from the port showed images of a chair floating in the water as well as packages of slippers washing ashore. The Long Beach Fire Department used one of its fireboats with high-powered nozzles to corral and direct the containers. They were seen pushing them toward a berth area as well as harbor boats that were being used to nudge the boxes toward the dock. The port said in its statement on Wednesday that the fallen containers had been recovered. Floating containers were moved into a secure location away from vessel traffic (Port of Long Beach) Speculation is mounting on the cause of the incident. It is unclear if the ship, which had arrived earlier in the morning, had begun container handling. The published schedule reflected a planned departure later today for the return to Vietnam. The Mississippi, registered in Portugal, was built in 2024. It had undergone five port state inspections, the last in April 2025 in Shanghai. It was cited for deficiencies, including with its Voyage Data Recorder and the crew’s safety drill, but did not receive a detention. Operations are continuing at the port to stabilize the containers aboard the vessel, including several that are continuing to be suspended over the side of the ship as well as the collapsed stacks. The U.S. Coast Guard reports it will be leading an investigation into the incident as will the National Transportation Safety Board.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45
DOJ Tells Court to Reject Challenge to Empire Wind’s Licensing,https://maritime-executive.com/article/doj-tells-court-to-reject-challenge-to-empire-wind-s-licensing,,10/09/2025 18:34:06,,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion in an ongoing case challenging the licensing for the construction of the Empire Wind offshore energy project, citing the lack of merit in the opposition’s claims and defending the licensing process. The filing contradicts some of the positions the Trump administration has taken to challenge other offshore wind projects. The filing was made on September 5 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a case filed by local opponents of offshore wind that call their group Save Long Beach Island. The group has repeatedly filed claims in court seeking injunctions against the permits issued for the wind farm projects. The current case against the U.S. Department of Commerce is seeking emergency injunctive relief to enjoin the construction of Empire Wind, which is underway, as well as the effective dates of the project’s Record of Decision and the National Marine Fisheries Service’s Letter of Authorization. In the past, the Trump administration has cited concerns over the regulatory approvals for offshore wind projects and claimed the Biden administration rushed projects through the approval process. In April, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management stopped offshore activity for Empire Wind, citing some of these same concerns, but a month later reversed its order and permitted the project’s offshore work to resume. Save Long Beach Island, in its case, argues against the approval under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, after having twice before made similar claims in a New Jersey court. DOJ responds citing the history of the approval noting that notices were first published in 2022, and after conducting a review and public comments, a proposed rule for Empire Wind was released in 2023. It was finalized in February 2024 and modified in January 2025. The response from the DOJ cites the significant delay in filing the court case and the lack of responses in the public comment period as evidence that disproves any allegation of an emergency. It points out that the plaintiffs have had numerous occasions to challenge the permitting, in addition to the two prior cases. Citing that construction has been underway for well over a year, it also says disproves claims that the orders would “preserve a status quo,” or prevent irreparable harm. “The public interest would undoubtedly be harmed by Plaintiffs’ unwarranted interference with government-issued permits and approvals,” DOJ concludes in its motion. “The public is best served when the government is permitted to use the expertise of its federal agencies to decide issues within their areas of specialization, such as the complex scientific and environmental matters at issue here. Plaintiffs attempt to improperly influence this process by asking the court to grant “emergency” relief on the basis of their layman opinions. Allowing such an outcome would harm the public interest by unnecessarily disrupting years of work and analysis that Federal Defendants conducted in connection with issuing the challenged Project approvals.” While DOJ defends the review process and licensing for Empire Wind, it has recently told other courts that it would be moving to revoke licenses for other projects, including Maryland’s offshore wind project being developed by US Wind and Massachusetts’ SouthCoast Wind being developed by Ocean Wind North America, a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie. It is also targeting New England Wind, which is being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Bloomberg reports, announced on September 10 during an energy conference in Milan that the U.S. is currently reviewing five offshore wind projects. This came after the administration issued a stop work order on the 80 percent installed Revolution Wind project being built by Ørsted. “Right now, under this administration, there is not a future” for offshore wind projects, Bloomberg reports Burgum said at the conference. “I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.” Ørsted completed the U.S.’s first commercial-scale offshore wind project called South Fork Wind in 2024. Several others are under development, including Empire Wind and Vineyard Wind 1. While several developers have said they remain committed to their projects, many others have deferred or written down the value of the projects, citing the uncertainties under the Trump administration.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45
"HITRON Catches its 1,000th Smuggling Boat, Using Force Without Fatalities",https://maritime-executive.com/article/hitron-catches-its-1-000th-smuggling-boat-using-force-without-fatalities,,10/09/2025 18:28:44,,"The U.S. Coast Guard's Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) has completed its 1,000th drug-running interdiction, racking up yet another disabled go-fast boat. On August 25, a HITRON team aboard USCGC Midgett was operating about 375 nautical miles southwest of Acapulco, in the Eastern Pacific transit zone. A trafficking vessel was spotted and refused to heave to for boarding, so the team disabled the boat for law enforcement boarding. Midgett's crew recovered more than 3,600 pounds of cocaine from the vessel. HITRON was commissioned in 2000 with a mission to stop suspect go-fast vessels and slow the flow of cocaine into the U.S. Its tactics are unique: its sharpshooters operate from helicopters deployed aboard Coast Guard cutters in U.S. Southern Command, and they give pursuit when a smuggling boat is in range. If radio hails and warning shots do not bring the suspect boat to a halt, the HITRON team uses .50-caliber rifles to shoot out the boat's outboards. This compels the smuggling vessel to stop, generally in safety; loss of life is accidental, vanishingly rare, and investigated when it occurs. HITRON hit its 500th interdiction mark in 2017, having stopped a combined 422,000 kilograms of cocaine with a wholesale value estimated in the range of $17 billion (at the time). Over the past 12 months alone, HITRON squadrons have added another $3.3 billion to the tally. The only drug interdicted in a meaningful economic quantity off Latin America is cocaine, much of which is bound for European markets via commercial seaports in the Caribbean islands and Central America. The remainder makes its way to North America, predominantly overland via Mexico and the U.S. southern border. U.S. Coast Guard interdictions of cocaine are by far the largest U.S. law enforcement drug seizures by value, due both to volume and to cocaine's exceptional price per kilo. Cocaine accounted for about 30,000 fatal drug overdoses in the U.S. in 2023, according to the NIH. Fentanyl, predominantly made in Mexico and smuggled in by land, accounted for about 74,000 deaths.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 04:37:45

At about 1150 hours UTC on September 8, during an arrival from Kotka, CMA CGM Mermaid allided with the quay at Muuga's container terminal. Images obtained by local media show significant local damage to the quay, which the ship's plumb bow sliced into by several meters. An adjacent bulker, the Belasitza, was also damaged at the bow. The extent of any damage to the boxship was not immediately disclosed. As of the morning of September 11, CMA CGM Mermaid was still moored alongside the quay wall at Muuga. CMA CGM Mermaid is a novel new house-forward container feeder with a capacity of 2,000 TEU, one in a series of 10 sister ships designed by Chantiers de l'Atlantique and HHI.

Remembering 9/11: Lt. Michael Day and the Lower Manhattan Boatlift,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/remembering-9-11-lt-michael-day-and-the-lower-manhattan-boatlift,,11/09/2025 00:01:00,,"On September 11, 2001, Lieutenant Michael Day was working at Coast Guard Activities New York preparing to leave for a meeting at Tower One of the World Trade Center when the command center alert came in. A plane had hit one of the World Trade Center towers. Then another hit. “We were unable to get any reports from lower Manhattan since all the communications systems failed. It was chaotic. People from multiple agencies were responding to the scene without any unity of purpose,” he said. “There wasn’t a pre-planned response; there was no CONOP for how to respond to two planes crashing into the Towers.” Not having a specific response plan for this situation, Day grabbed the closest thing he could think of to help – the OPSAIL 2000 plan. “I knew it had a lot of ambulance staging areas. We had a lot of evacuation points identified. Although it wasn’t necessarily a full-scale evacuation plan, it had information,” he said. As Day rushed out the door to head to the waterfront, Andrew McGovern, pilot of the 100-foot pilot boat NEW YORK, showed up for the meeting. They grabbed a bunch of extra lifejackets, the OPSAIL plan, a Coast Guard Ensign and headed for the pilot boat. “I remember listening to the radio because by this time we were underway on the boat and it was just... chaos. Every channel you clicked to people were screaming, ‘Help, people are here... I’ve got someone hurt here’,” he said. With a front row seat to the collapsing buildings, frightened people and distressing devastation, Day only momentarily worried about his own safety. With thousands of citizens needing help, he didn’t have time to stop and think about what was happening. Despite poor radio communication and unreliable cellular reception, Day began dispatching Coast Guardsmen with handheld radios to the piers to help coordinate a more organized evacuation effort. Meanwhile, he hoisted the Coast Guard Ensign on the pilot boat and began broadcasting to all available boats willing to help with the evacuation to assemble off the tip of Governors Island and await further assignment. New Yorkers rushed to the Lower Manhattan water front to try to escape the collapse of the World Trade Center towers September 11. They were later evacuated by ferries and tugboats from all over New York harbor. (USCG photo by Chief Brandon Brewer) The process of transporting the crowds of people from Manhattan to safety, one boat load at a time, continued into the evening. With the pilot boat docked in lower Manhattan, still flying the Coast Guard Ensign, first responders began asking them for help. Establishing communications with the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management, he was able to start getting some supplies brought over to the pier... first water, then ice and meals. Soon, more specific items like tools, equipment and fuel began to arrive. “We were quickly overrun with relief supplies,” he said. “It was just such a ‘can do’ effort. Everyone wanted to help.” In what he called, “hands-on VTS,” Day and a Chief Boatswain’s Mate managed the hundreds of vessels bringing supplies to the pier. “We set up three different staging areas because the supplies were coming in so fast and furious that we were running out of room, and we couldn’t distribute them fast enough,” he added. The pure scope of the event and lack of communication with his superiors meant making decisions wasn’t always easy for Day, nor were his actions always by the book, but he looks at the response as great example of initiative and teamwork. Getting more than one hundred boats and dozens of response crews to work together cohesively is not an easy task. But for Day, it just sort of happened under what he describes as a “common purpose.” A Coast Guard rescue team from Sandy Hook, NJ, races to the scene of the World Trade Center terrorist attack. (USCG photo by PA2 Tom Sperduto) Day also learned valuable leadership lessons. “One is the value of partnering and partnerships, and building your bridges before you need them,” he said. “Two, making your people feel empowered. I really felt when I worked for Admiral Bennis that I was totally empowered to do the right thing. And three, to have faith in your people and the power of the concept of unity of purpose.” After four days of responding with only about three hours of sleep total, Day finally had some time to reflect on what had happened. “And it’s when I had quiet time, you know, a little bit alone to myself that it really, really struck home,” he said. “I think being in the Coast Guard we kind of shut things off at times of stress; it’s like a defense mechanism.” This article originally appeared in Coast Guard Compass and may be found in archived form here.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 09:30:52

U.S. Coast Guard Buys 10 More Fast Response Cutters From Bollinger,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-buys-10-more-fast-response-cutters-from-bollinger,,11/09/2025 02:02:28,,"The United States Coast Guard announced Tuesday that it will award $507 million to Bollinger to begin construction of 10 more Fast Response Cutters, which are the backbone of its nearshore patrol fleet and a versatile stand-in for overseas missions. The agreement is part of the service's newly-invigorated shipbuilding plan, bolstered by historic new funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Act handed the Coast Guard nearly $25 billion for procurement and repairs, including $1 billion for FRCs. The congressionally-authorized order brings the total Fast Response Cutter fleet under contract from 67 vessels to 77, expanding on one of America's most successful shipbuilding programs. Since the first hull joined the fleet in 2012 to replace the service's aging 110-foot Island-class patrol vessels, FRCs have grown in number and voyaged the seas; they are now homeported around the world, from Florida to Alaska to Guam and Bahrain. Currently, 59 Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutters are actively deployed alongside larger assets. Though small compared to a medium-endurance cutter (WMEC), the FRCs are much bigger than the predecessor Island-class cutters, and have been tested on much longer oceangoing deployments than typically assigned to vessels of this size. Capable of achieving maximum speeds between 28 and 30 knots, the cutter can also transit up to 2,500 nautical miles at 12 knots. The vessels' elevated bow and fin stabilizers improve their handling characteristics beyond what might be expected for a 350-ton hull, enabling small boat deployment in waves of up to six feet in height. And with a 22-person roster and a lieutenant in command, they are lean and efficient to crew, a major virtue for a resource-constrained Coast Guard.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 15:40:16
New Coast Guard Cyber Rules Take Hold Across U.S. Maritime Industry,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/new-coast-guard-cyber-rules-take-hold-across-u-s-maritime-industry,,11/09/2025 01:11:15,,"In July 2025, new U.S. Coast Guard cybersecurity regulations went into effect. These regulations follow high-profile incidents, such as a 2021 Russian ransomware attack that shut down a major U.S. pipeline for days, causing fuel shortages and disrupting critical supply chains. The Russian pipeline attack demonstrated the severe consequences of a cyber incident and the growing risks posed by foreign adversaries such as China, Russia, and Iran. In response, the Coast Guard has issued regulations that now require vessels and facilities to adopt cybersecurity measures to protect the maritime sector against evolving threats. The new cybersecurity regulations require every covered vessel and facility to create a Coast Guard–approved cybersecurity plan. The cybersecurity plan must be submitted to the Coast Guard, kept up to date, and integrated into the vessel or facility’s existing security framework. Owners and operators must also appoint a designated Cybersecurity Officer to oversee the plan, ensure compliance, and remain accessible to the Coast Guard 24/7. The plan will ensure that the vessel or facility limits access to critical systems, protects data, and monitors for intrusions. Cybersecurity plans must implement specific cybersecurity measures such as: automatic account lockouts, strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and encryption of data. (No more leaving passwords on a sticky note). The regulations also require personnel training and drills. All personnel with access to computer systems must now receive cybersecurity training. This means that any seafarer with regular access to a computer must be trained to recognize cybersecurity threats, detect incidents, and report them to the Cybersecurity Officer. Every covered vessel and facility must run cybersecurity drills twice a year, and a full exercise at least once every 18 months to test overall readiness. The drills focus on detecting, responding to, and mitigating cyber incidents. Vessel and facility operators also must conduct regular assessments and testing to identify vulnerabilities, fix problems, and prepare for cyber incidents. Every covered vessel and facility must maintain an incident response plan, report cyber incidents, and keep records of training, drills, and testing. They must also undergo “penetration testing” where cybersecurity professionals attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to identify weaknesses. This penetration testing must be completed at least once every five years as a part of each cybersecurity plan renewal. The new regulations apply only to U.S.-flagged vessels, marine facilities, and Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities, but do not apply to foreign-flagged vessels. Covered vessels include oceangoing cargo ships and tankers, offshore supply vessels that service rigs and platforms, and passenger vessels certificated to carry more than 150 passengers, such as ferries or coastal cruise ships. Towing vessels longer than eight meters that move tank barges or other covered barges are also included. There are also less-obvious cases which would be covered by the regulations, such as a U.S.-flagged passenger vessel carrying more than 12 passengers on an international voyage (for example, a small fishing or dive trip from Florida to the Bahamas). By contrast, smaller inland vessels such as harbor tugs, crane barges, dredges, and other workboats are generally not included unless they fall within a defined category. Generally speaking, if a vessel does not have significant tonnage, carry a large number of passengers, handle hazardous cargo, or operate abroad, it falls outside the scope of these new regulations. The regulations also extend to shoreside facilities as well. Covered facilities include container terminals, petroleum and chemical transfer facilities, major cruise ship terminals, and barge fleeting areas that handle hazardous materials in bulk. Facilities that receive large passenger vessels or SOLAS-class ships are also included. Smaller marinas, yacht clubs, and local boatyards are generally not covered by these cybersecurity requirements unless they serve these larger, regulated vessels. While the regulations went into effect on July 16, 2025, there is a multi-year phase-in period for these new cybersecurity requirements. The key dates are: In practical terms, operators are already required to report all cyber incidents to the National Response Center, and will need to have their training programs running by early 2026. They will have until mid-2027 to complete their first cybersecurity assessments and submit their plans for approval. From then forward, they will be on a cycle of annual audits, exercises, and five-year plan renewals. The implementation of these cybersecurity regulations will have ripple effects across the maritime industry. The new regulations will raise operating costs for vessels and facilities by requiring compliance with mandates such as hiring and training cybersecurity officers, developing cybersecurity plans, adopting enhanced security measures, conducting regular drills, and performing ongoing assessments and reporting. In the near term, it is possible that insurance costs may rise initially as the threat of cyberattacks is still increasing, and the industry is still adjusting. In the long run, these mandatory cybersecurity regulations may reduce the likelihood of severe cyber incidents, making losses less frequent and more predictable for insurers. This predictability may eventually stabilize or reduce premiums over time. The ultimate impact of these regulations on the broader maritime industry remains to be seen, but these new regulations have pushed cybersecurity to the forefront of maritime operations. Kevin G. Gallagher is a litigation associate at Hamilton, Miller & Birthisel, and focuses his practice on admiralty and maritime claims, commercial litigation, insurance claims and products liability.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 15:40:16

Video: Ukraine Damages Russian Spy Ship with Long-Distance Drone Attack,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-ukraine-damages-russian-spy-ship-with-long-distance-drone-attack,,11/09/2025 16:15:00,,"The Intelligence Ministry for the Defense of Ukraine is reporting that its special forces carried off another long-distance raid, this time successfully damaging a Russian multipurpose vessel operating in the eastern portion of the Black Sea. The video shows a drone attack that centered in on the vessel’s antennas and electronic equipment. The vessel was reported to be operating in Novorossiyska Bay in the eastern Black Sea, and the current home of the Black Sea fleet. Media reports highlight that it is over 400 km (approximately 250 miles) from the front lines in the war. If the drone took a flight path avoiding Crimea, it likely traveled over 600 km (more than 370 miles) to reach its target. Ukraine reports the vessel, which was built in 2015, was designed for seabed inspections with diving systems, ROVs, and side-scan sonar. It was also being used as a base for electronic intelligence equipment. At the time of the attack, Ukraine says it was operating radio surveillance equipment and patrolling the bay. The report states that the electronic intelligence systems were destroyed and the vessel disabled. Ukraine put the value of the vessel at more than $60 million. According to the media reports, the identity of the vessel was still being determined, although it is likely the Spasatel Demidov, based on the description. Ukraine says that it believes multiple ships of the class are deployed in the region. It said there are four ships in the Project MPSV07 class, although data shows that five have been commissioned and a sixth is under construction. The ships are approximately 2,500 gross tons and 240 feet (73 meters) in length. This attack comes as Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine, and the Ukrainians responded by stepping up their assaults in the Black Sea region. They recently claimed to have damaged two radar stations in Crimea and a harbor tug in Sevastopol. Last month, Ukraine claimed to have damaged a missile boat in the Sea of Azov in another daring long-distance maritime strike. The media writes that Ukraine has either destroyed or disabled a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet since the start of the war. Russia also redeployed many of the vessels to the Novorossiysk Bay region to place them further from Ukraine.",Maritime Executive,11/09/2025 21:25:13

India’s Largest Terminal Operator Bans Sanctioned Vessels,https://maritime-executive.com/article/india-s-largest-terminal-operator-bans-sanctioned-vessels,,12/09/2025 00:08:48,,"Adani Group, which is India’s largest private terminal and port operator, has sent out a circular to all operators advising that it is banning all sanctioned vessels from all its operations, according to reports in the Indian media. They are confirming the earlier story from Reuters, which said it had seen a memorandum, but also noted that Adani has taken similar actions in the past. The move comes as India is under strong pressure from the United States to curtail its purchases of Russian oil. Last month, Donald Trump doubled the tariffs on India, citing its purchases of Russian oil, while reports this week indicated the U.S. is pressing Europe and the G7 countries for a 100 percent tariff on India. It was the latest of several actions by the U.S. targeting India and came just weeks after Trump met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Analysts highlighted that the escalating trade war and pressure on India were pushing India toward China and Russia and away from the United States. Modi was a prominent guest at China’s conference with Russia and the military parade to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II. On Tuesday, the tensions seemed to de-escalate as Trump took to social media, saying the trade talks were resuming. He said the U.S. was confident a new deal would be reached with India. India has remained a key buyer of Russian oil alongside China. The sanctioning of a refinery with Russian investment seemed to briefly interrupt the trade, but despite various efforts, it has persisted. Earlier this year, there were reports that Indian refineries had begun turning away sanctioned tankers transporting Russian oil. Adani, according to the reports in the Indian media, writes in the new circular that all its ports will abide by the sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. All the listed ships, it says, will be prevented from calling at its ports. Adani Ports’ operations account for nearly one-fourth of the cargo movement in India. It has operations in 13 Indian ports in seven states. The company just this week highlighted that its Hazira Liquid Terminal, located on the northwest coast north of Mumbai, had achieved the second-highest-ever bulk liquid volume. It reported handling 507,276 metric tonnes (0.51 million tonnes) in August 2025. It said that 71 liquid tankers had been handled during the month and that the volume surpassed the previous record of 0.49 million tonnes set in October 2021.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Wärtsilä to Equip Danish Ferries with Integrated Electric Propulsion System,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/wartsila-to-equip-danish-ferries-with-integrated-electric-propulsion-system,,11/09/2025 23:53:03,,"[By: Wärtsilä] Technology group Wärtsilä has been selected to deliver a fully integrated electric propulsion system with waterjets for two new high-speed catamaran ferries being built for Danish ferry operator Molslinjen. The battery-electric vessels are being built at the Incat shipyard in Tasmania, with Wärtsilä supplying the integrated electric propulsion system, the DC power conversion system, its energy management and automation systems, eight electric propulsion motors and waterjets, as well as the Wärtsilä ProTouch propulsion control system for smooth and efficient sailing. The ferries will serve the Kattegat route, setting a milestone towards the green transition for ferry services and for Denmark as a whole. “This is a major project that supports the ferry industry’s move towards more decarbonised operations. With these electric ferries built by Incat and powered by Wärtsilä's electrification technology, we aim to remove thousands of tons of CO? emissions from Denmark’s climate footprint each year,” comments Kristian Durhuus, CEO, Molslinjen. Ferries play a vital role in meeting the growing demand for more sustainable transport options, with ship electrification being a key solution for enabling the sector to transition towards net-zero emissions. “Our partnership with Molslinjen and Incat not only brings electric vessels to the Kattegat route, but also continues our joint commitment in accelerating the industry's path towards net-zero emissions shipping. Wärtsilä's values and principles in shipping are deeply rooted in sustainability, innovation, and performance, and through our experience in vessel electrification, we have already delivered solutions for 150 hybrid-electric ships, with this number continuing to grow,” explains Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine & Executive Vice President at Wärtsilä Corporation. The two ferries will each measure 129 meters in length and 30.5 meters in width, accommodating up to 1,483 passengers and 500 cars. The addition of these new vessels will increase total capacity for cars and passengers on the Kattegat route by more than 25 percent. The ships are expected to join the fleet in Denmark during 2027 and 2028. “We’re not just building ships – we are building the future,” says Stephen Casey, CEO, Incat Tasmania. “Large-scale, low-emission transport solutions are not only possible, but are ready now. Incat Tasmania has always been at the forefront of innovating and pioneering new technology and design. The vessels address the market’s needs and requirements by utilising batteries, making this a very viable option for owners and operators looking to increase the sustainability of their fleets. Wärtsilä is a key player in the success of this project, supporting our goal of large-scale, low-emission transport with a completely integrated propulsion package.” The eight electric driven waterjet configuration feature low weight, shallow draft operation, low maintenance and easy access, safety and reliability, as well as superb manoeuvrability as a result of its integrated steering and reversing with quick response times. The waterjets have been designed for the highest overall propulsion efficiency. As the power is divided over more jets, the power density is lower, which means a higher efficiency. The Wärtsilä equipment is scheduled for delivery to the yard commencing in 2026.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Recovery Proceeds in Long Beach as Unified Command Looks for Answers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/recovery-proceeds-in-long-beach-as-unified-command-looks-for-answers,,11/09/2025 22:45:10,,"The operation to remove containers from Long Beach harbor continues as the Unified Command is also working to understand the cause of the container collapse from the docked ship Mississippi on Tuesday morning, September 9. The port emphasizes that it is operational while the team is also working to clear the channel to Pier G, where the vessel is docked. In a press briefing, the Coast Guard provided some additional details on the incident as well as the efforts underway. They said the collapse began around 0848 while “unloading operations” were underway. The ship had docked earlier that morning after a Pacific crossing from Vietnam and China, and the USCG reports there were 2,412 containers aboard. The estimate was increased to approximately 75 that went into the harbor, while some additional boxes fell onto the pier. At least two rows aboard the vessel have collapsed, with many boxes still askew aboard the vessel. The Coast Guard called the situation and the early stages of the investigation “dynamic.” The focus currently is on securing and the safety of the area, with the USCG Pacific Strike Team overseeing the lifting of boxes from the harbor. At least two were removed on Wednesday, and they are using sonar to locate the other submerged boxes. They believe 25 to 30 are submerged in the harbor. The floating boxes were all pushed to an area where they are being retrieved. Containers being lifted from Long Beach harbor (USCG) An oil containment boom was seen around the area, and the USCG confirmed there had been a small release of light oil from the emissions barge that was alongside. They estimate that there were 2,000 gallons of a renewable diesel on the barge. Also, contrary to early reports, USCG said there had been workers on the barge who scrambled as the collapse began. One sprained their ankle and was treated on the scene. A spokesperson for STAX Engineering, which operates the emission capture barge, told The Maritime Executive its team was assessing all the damage and is already working to get STAX 2 back in service. Operations across the rest of the company’s seven barges throughout California were not impacted. The Coast Guard said it would be looking at many factors, including the possibility of human or mechanical failure. Gary Herrera, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 13, asserted that it “was not human error.” He said it did not involve any union workers. Most of the containers reportedly did not break open after entering the water. Several, however, were crushed with TV reporters showing images of furniture and slippers floating in the water. The port said the containers also were transporting apparel and electronics. While the Port of Long Beach is operational, shippers are reporting that Zim advised that its next vessel due at the port will be diverting to the neighboring Port of Los Angeles.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Could Ukraine's Drone Boats Fight for America Too?,https://maritime-executive.com/article/could-ukraine-s-drone-boats-fight-for-america-too,,11/09/2025 22:25:00,,"Red Cat, a prominent American drone builder, wants to begin making battle-proven Ukrainian drone boat designs for U.S. military customers. Unmanned systems are a top acquisition priority for the Navy and for the Pentagon as a whole, and Red Cat's newly-formed Blue Ops division hopes to meet that need at scale, with short lead times and mature solutions. To learn more, TME spoke with Blue Ops' new CEO, Barry Hinckley, a longtime tech executive and a member of the Hinckley boatbuilding family. To start us off, it would be great to hear a bit about yourself and about Blue Ops. I'm launching Blue Ops for Red Cat, which sort of brings together my entire career and life. I grew up in a third-generation boat building family up in Maine. The industry was devastated in the 1980s-90s, first by the offshoring of American jobs - competing with workforces around the world that weren't subject to American labor laws, EPA regulations, or American standard of living. That was a devastating wave to American shipbuilding. I never thought I'd see the day when manufacturing was getting revived, and certainly not with boats. I am overjoyed that I can be a part of rebuilding marine manufacturing in America. It's amazing. Reopening a factory in Valdosta, Georgia that has been shuttered and employing hundreds of people down there in the coming months and years to build American boats is so exciting. I also have a strong technical background and boatbuilding background, so this merges both of them and it's quite fulfilling for me. Can you tell us a bit about Blue Ops' initial product? I understand it's combat proven in the Black Sea, and I'm interested in learning about its capabilities. We started with a seven-meter boat because it is the most versatile of our proposed fleet. It has five different configurations. It can carry machine guns, anti-aircraft missiles, and there are two different versions that launch UAVs — which is great for us because our goal is to be an all-domain defense company, and we are already strong in UAVs. One version launches a single, large UAV and another has two compartments that launch eight UAVs combined. Then there is the kinetic version, which carries 1,400 pounds of C4 explosive material. So that would be more than what they call, in the vernacular, ""kamikaze."" It's proven, and it's a deep-V hull. For a boat that size, it has a fair amount of self-righting capability. The nice thing about not carrying humans is you can lower the center of gravity. You don't need any creature comforts, so the boats can right themselves. That means they can handle higher sea states. Certainly with payload in the right places and fuel in the right places, you can create a very stable platform that can handle the higher sea states. The great thing about that boat is, if you think about the five different configurations, you can launch 40 of these, all configured differently at a target with long range. The boat carries 1,200 liters of fuel, so you've got hundreds of miles of range. And if it's a one-way trip, you can be pretty lethal at a long distance. That's why we're starting with the seven-meter. It's a very capable and very proven system over the past three years in the Ukraine conflict. Do you see an application for this kind of small vessel in some of the U.S. Navy's top priority regions? Yes, of course. We're probably getting into version three of these boats now. Over the past three years, the iteration has been very rapid at the speed of conflict, which is why we think we have an advantage. They stared with a singular or a couple of boats remotely driven by humans to engage the target, and now they're getting pretty good at the swarming tactics and swarming boats. I would imagine that they're going to fit in very well with the ""hellscape scenario"" that we've all read about in the Taiwan Strait, for example, because these boats are very mature in their development. The second part of that is we can iterate very quickly. If you think of this as kind of a two-part play, payload aside, the Navy — whatever branch of military desires — the boats and their payloads are going to vary depending on their mission, right? But if you take the boat, for example, we can iterate very quickly. The boat is simply the platform. Sure, there's some science and technology in building a great boat, but we can do that. We've done that, so then you layer on the technology to get to the mission. If the demands are for a slightly different hull shape or a different sea state, we can turn a new boat design around and have the first hull out the door in about three months. Then it's just about adjusting the tech stack to that new boat, which is really tweaking. If you're talking about building a boat that's maybe eight and a half meters, has to be a little wider, maybe a W hull versus a V hull configuration to handle sea state five, and it has to be self-righting because it's going to be getting pounded in the Pacific — we envision a future where we'll be tweaking hull shapes depending on the theater, but we can do that quickly. Between my family and our partners in the Hodgdon family, we've got eight generations of boat building experience. We know we can build an awesome boat that is really rugged and will do the job. Will these be remote-controlled or autonomous? We're working with autonomy partners. We take a baseline boat, baseline mature remote control system, good comms, and then we build on top of it with American technology, in collaboration with U.S. governmental agencies, whether it be Navy, Coast Guard, or Customs and Border Patrol, depending on what their demands are. We work with them to produce the final product. We have the platform. We build it. It's solid, it's sound. We've got a great remote control system that's stable and mature in its fourth year of iteration. Then you add on the technology — the autonomy that relates to not only navigation and communications, but payload delivery. It's early days, but there are American companies that are building payload autonomy, and that's the future. This is why I'm pretty confident America can win this one, because we are still the technology leaders in the world, and we certainly—hopefully—remain so. Are you looking at a rapid acquisition contract for a government customer in the near future? We have our own production. We have a 155,000 square foot factory that we're reopening in Valdosta, Georgia, which is great for the community. They've got the capacity there, and they've got the workforce there that's ready to roll. We've got our own capacity on one shift for 600 hulls a year, and we'd like to get to 1,200 hulls, and we can do that with the capacity we have. America is behind in its production capability, and we need the wheels turning up production as soon as possible. If, heaven forbid, a conflict does happen and they need thousands of boats a year rather than a few hundred, we can ramp production up because the machine is already running. We'll have boats in the water this fall and we're already building, so we'd love to start putting them to work. It seems like the Navy and also the Pentagon as a whole are very interested in moving fast with this. Do you see it speeding up? I've heard stories about the older requisition process taking years, and it's hard to keep a factory moving if you're waiting for an order for years. So we're hopeful that this realignment, combined with Secretary Hegseth's order in August to focus on the rapid acquisition of more drones, will lead to more orders sooner so we can start. The reality is, we need to start making these USVs now. We are behind as a country. The threats are real, and the ocean is three-quarters of the world's surface. We need to be there, and we need to be in a lot of places that would be uncomfortable, impossible or impractical to put a human for any long period of time. Well, we can send these boats out for days. Compared to, say, dispatching an anti-ship cruise missile, is this seven-meter drone going to be a cheaper weapons system? Yes, a lot cheaper. It's a competitive market right now. We're not the only people in this game, and we're all keeping each other pretty honest when it comes to pricing. The U.S. government is going to get a huge bang for their buck with these boats. - TME",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Disney Adventure’s MV Postponed Three Months Citing Construction Delays,https://maritime-executive.com/article/disney-adventure-s-mv-postponed-three-months-citing-construction-delays,,11/09/2025 22:23:00,,"Disney Cruise Line informed passengers that it is delaying the maiden voyage for its new Singapore-based cruise ship, Disney Adventure. The news came a day after the ship completed its first sea trials after seven years of construction. The new cruise ship, which is the largest ever built in Germany and the largest for Disney Cruise Line, is one of only a few to exceed the 200,000 gross ton threshold. Work started in 2018 by MV Werften, a shipbuilder set up by the vessel’s owners, Genting Hong Kong. A large portion of the vessel was towed in late 2019 to the building hall in Wismar, Germany, and the ship was reported to be as much as 80 percent complete when the shipbuilder and its parent went bankrupt in 2022. Disney acquired the incomplete ship reportedly for €40 million, with an agreement to complete the ship in Germany. Reports suggest they have invested as much as $1 billion in reimaging the vessel in the Disney style. The line notes that it is an “ambitious transformation” and a first-of-its-kind project for Disney Cruise Line. Meyer Werft, which is also building Disney’s new cruise ships, was retained to oversee the completion of the ship. Disney Adventure was moved from the building hall in April, and on September 1, set off on her first sea trials. The ship was in the Baltic and later the North Sea before arriving in Bremerhaven on September 9. Reports indicated that over 1,400 shipyard workers and contractors were aboard during the trials. “As we work on the final touches to bring the Disney Adventure to our guests, we’ve encountered unexpected delays in the shipbuilding process,” said Joe Schott, President of Disney Signature Experiences. “To ensure the experience we deliver reflects our commitment to excellence, we’ve made the decision to adjust our timeline. We know this may be disappointing to our guests, and we’re working directly with them to offer flexible rebooking options and uphold the trust they place in us.” The ship had been scheduled for its first revenue cruise from Singapore on December 15. It has now been reset for March 10, 2026. When she enters service, she will be the company’s only ship homeported year-round in Asia, and she will be operating three- and four-night ocean cruises. Disney Adventure will be 208,100 gross tons when completed with accommodations for approximately 6,700 passengers. Some features, such as the longest roller-coaster at sea, are being held over from the original plans, but all the public spaces are being reworked in Disney style. The ship will have over 2,100 passenger cabins as well as seven themed areas. It incorporates character experiences from Disney, Pixar, and Marvel. It is not the first time Disney Cruise Line has delayed a maiden voyage. Famously, in 1998, the launch of the company was delayed for months, with the maiden voyage date for its first ship, Disney Magic, reset three times. Reports said achieving Disney’s exacting standards was a challenge during the shipbuilding process. Disney Magic entered service in July 1998. More recently, in 2022, the maiden voyage of Disney Wish was delayed six weeks, with the line and shipbuilder Meyer citing the impact of the pandemic on the building process. The delay of Disney Adventure also permits the brand to focus on the launch of its other new cruise ship, Disney Destiny (144,256 GT), the third ship of the Wish class being built in Papenburg, Germany. She was recently floated out of the building hall by Meyer Werft and enters service from Port Everglades, Florida, on November 20. The introduction of Disney Adventure is being closely followed by the industry as it will become the largest cruise ship in Asia.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Classic WWII-Era Yacht Sinks Near Bremerton,https://maritime-executive.com/article/classic-wwii-era-yacht-sinks-near-bremerton,,11/09/2025 21:49:39,,"The U.S. Coast Guard has set up a unified command to respond to the sinking of the historic yacht Cairdeas near Bremerton, Washington. Cairdeas is a classic 34-meter yacht built in 1943 at the Fellows & Stewart Yard, and according to private databases she was designed by the famed naval architecture house of Sparkman & Stephens. The wooden-hulled vessel had been a familiar sight around the Northwest coast for decades and had been restored may times, but had reportedly fallen into disrepair in recent years. Cairdeas had a history of resurrection. In her heyday, under charter to Warner Brothers for movie work, she hosted some of the biggest starts of the era, including Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson, according to a retrospective published in the Anacortes American in 1994. She burnt to the waterline in 1973, but was restored with an aluminum superstructure. Two decades later, in 1993, she sank while she was moored on the Fraser River in British Columbia, and her classic interiors were destroyed by flooding and removed. She was restored once more and resold to continue her career. Under current ownership, the yacht had sat idle for some time in Sinclair Inlet, according to local reports, and had been declared abandoned by the state in 2023. It ran aground last year in a windstorm, then sank completely last weekend. Resting on the bottom in Sinclair Inlet, Cairdeas is a spill risk, and the Coast Guard has responded accordingly. About 2,600 feet of boom has been strung out around the vessel, and divers are installing vent plugs to stop any discharge. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has been tapped to pay for the immediate response; typically the owner is billed for the pollution abatement expenses after the fact.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
ABB & Blykalla Collaborate on Nuclear Power Technology for Industry,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/abb-blykalla-collaborate-on-nuclear-power-technology-for-industry,,11/09/2025 21:39:05,,"ABB has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Swedish nuclear energy company Blykalla to support and accelerate the deployment of small modular lead-cooled reactors to the maritime industry. Building on the terms of an existing MoU between Blykalla and ABB signed in October 2024 , which targets developing lead-cooled SMR technology to support Sweden’s clean energy requirements, this agreement expands the partnership and aligns with growing momentum for nuclear energy as a marine power source. In June, International Maritime Organization administrations at the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC 110) approved recommendations to amend the Code of Safety for Nuclear Merchant Ships to account for advances in nuclear technology – including SMRs – since the Code entered into force. Blykalla’s Swedish Advanced Lead Reactor (SEALER) is a highly compact, passively safe reactor with inherent safety structures which means they do not require any operator actions. It was one of three reactors identified in the Nuclear Propulsion for Merchant Ships I (NuProShip I) project, which aims to adapt a Generation IV SMR to the requirements of maritime vessels – in particular larger ships. ABB’s expertise in system integration as well as power distribution, control, and automation technologies, will be key to ensuring the successful deployment of the SMR as a shipboard solution. “We’re pleased to extend our partnership with ABB into this strategically important vertical. With our compact reactor design, we see a unique opportunity to lead the way in maritime nuclear propulsion – a solution uniquely positioned to meet the sector’s demand for clean energy,” said Jacob Stedman, CEO at Blykalla. “Realizing this vision will require an ecosystem of committed partners, and this collaboration is a critical building block.” “SMRs hold significant potential to drive decarbonization, and our collaboration with Blykalla will help to advance their viability in maritime applications,” said Juha Koskela, President, ABB’s Marine & Ports division. “Next-generation SMRs will enable innovative ship designs that can help to reduce emissions compared to vessels powered by carbon-based fuels.

Taiwan to Review Ship's P&I Coverage and Expand Patrols to Protect Ports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/taiwan-to-review-ship-s-p-i-coverage-and-expand-patrols-to-protect-ports,,11/09/2025 20:20:51,,"Taiwan has been on high alert as it fears Chinese efforts at sabotage of the island’s critical offshore infrastructure. Officials are now detailing a number of new steps planned to further increase its deterrence, including a new insurance requirement designed to ensure the efficacy of P&I insurance. The Maritime & Port Bureau (MOTC) issued a warning to shipowners on September 10 that starting next month, it will be introducing a new system for reviewing a shipowner’s liability insurance. As of October 15, vessels applying to enter or leave Taiwan’s commercial ports are required to have insurance from a carrier with a credit rating of BBB or higher. They note in the announcement that 96.7 percent of vessels qualify for the new system, but also warn that owners should take steps in the month leading up to the start of the system. A total of 47 insurers are currently eligible, including companies in Taiwan or participants in the International Shipowners' Mutual Insurance and Insurance Club. Ships that do not have acceptable insurance run the risk of being denied port entry, MOTC warns. It says insurers that have applied for the international credit ratings can have an extension to April 15, 2026. Otherwise, shipowners may provide a deposit and submit a P&I insurance policy for entry and exit from Taiwan’s ports. Government officials note that they sought industry suggestions, including accepting a recommendation to delay implementation from July 1 to October 15, so owners could re-plan their insurance. It highlights that several announcements were made, including on May 14, to prepare owners for the change. Taiwan continues to be especially concerned about a fleet of older vessels that it says are Chinese-owned and registered in third-world flags such as Togo and anchor off its shores. Since earlier this year, Taiwan has implemented a monitoring program between the navy and coast guard designed to identify suspect vessels. There have been several cases where Taiwan sent coast guard vessels to chase away ships. It also detained vessels and convicted one Chinese captain of intentionally causing damage to an undersea cable. Taiwan is expanding these monitoring efforts, reporting that it will start maintaining 24-hour a day patrols. The focus will be on the Taiwan Strait to monitor undersea cables and act as a deterrent to vessels attempting to damage the country’s infrastructure.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
U.S. Navy Relieves a Deployed Littoral Combat Ship CO of Command,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-navy-relieves-a-deployed-littoral-combat-ship-co-of-command,,11/09/2025 20:05:54,,"The commanding officer of a Bahrain-based littoral combat ship crew has been relieved, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command announced Thursday. Cmdr. Adam Ochs, an Illinois native and father of four who took command of the USS Santa Barbara's Blue Crew in 2023, was removed from his duties. As is customary, the Navy refrained from releasing details beyond a ""loss of confidence."" ""The Navy maintains the highest standards for leaders and holds them accountable when those standards are not met,"" the service said in a statement. Since littoral combat ships have two crews, Ochs' replacement will be rapid. The commanding officer of the ship's Gold Crew, Cmdr. Linzy Lewis, is scheduled to take over the vessel on Friday. In the meantime, the Blue Crew's executive officer is in temporary command. Ochs, formerly XO aboard cruiser USS Leyte Gulf, has now been reassigned to Naval Surface Group Southwest in San Diego. It is typical for officers relieve of shipboard command to be moved ashore for a temporary administrative assignment. USS Santa Barbara is one of the first Independence-class LCS hulls to deploy with the long-awaited minehunting suite, a bolt-on mission package that began development in the 2000s and deployed for the first time earlier this year. It will replace the Navy's MH-53 mine countermeasures helicopter platform and the aging Avenger-class minehunting vessels, primarily used to counter the Iranian mine threat in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
CMA CGM Says No U.S. Surcharges Planned as Carriers Prepare for USTR Fees,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-says-no-u-s-surcharges-planned-as-carriers-prepare-for-ustr-fees,,11/09/2025 19:02:42,,"With just a month to go to the announced date that the U.S. will start charging fees to Chinese operators and vessels built in China, the shipping industry is working to blunt the impact. CMA CGM issued a customer update reporting that it is taking steps to shift deployments and, as a result, it does not plan to implement a surcharge at this time to cover the USTR-related fees. The French company, which has a fleet of over 740 vessels (343 owned), reports it is drawing on its flexible and diversified fleet to prepare for the upcoming implementation of the fees. While the final rules have yet to be released, it notes that, based on the April announcement by the U.S. Trade Representative, the fees will be phased in over three years. Furthermore, CMA CGM reports it used the 18—day grace period after the announcement to develop and implement an “adaptive contingency plan.” “Thanks to the fleet and operational adjustments we are now implementing ahead of October 14th, we currently expect to both maintain our service coverage to all scheduled U.S. ports and minimize any impacts of the upcoming USTR fees,” CMA CGM advised customers. It, however, admitted that the fees may create challenges for its operations. Based on the current structure of the fees, it says it does not plan to implement surcharges, with a caveat, “as currently structured.” The industry, however, waits for the release of the final details, while there have been unconfirmed reports that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will be tasked with collecting the fees. The carrier joins others in the industry that have said they are taking steps to shift deployments to avoid the fees. Maersk has said it expects to limit the impact by avoiding putting Chinese-built ships on routes to the U.S. Chinese companies are the most exposed, with analysts warning that the fees are likely to have a significant impact. China and its state shipping company COSCO have called the fees “discriminatory” and warned investors of the impact. Recently, an analyst at HSBC projected in a report to investors that without network changes, COSCO could face over $1.5 billion in fees in 2026, while its subsidiary OOCL could incur an additional $654 million. CMA CGM in March announced plans to make large investments into the U.S. It said it planned to triple its U.S.-flagged operations as part of an investment valued at $20 billion. The carrier, however, continues to build vessels in China and has recently been linked to reports of large future orders also with Chinese shipyards. CMA CGM currently has over 110 vessels on order, which would add 1.6 million TEU according to figures from Alphaliner, to a fleet that currently has a total capacity of approximately 4 million TEU.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35
Wan Hai Casualty Reaches UAE Port of Refuge After 13 Weeks at Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wan-hai-casualty-reaches-uae-port-of-refuge-after-13-weeks-at-sea,,11/09/2025 17:51:48,,"The containership Wan Hai 503 arrived on September 11 at the anchorage off the Jebel Ali port in the United Arab Emirates. The shipping company reports that the vessel has been granted approval by DP World and the Dubai Ports Authority to berth as a port of refuge, ending a long effort to find a port to accept the heavily fire-damaged hulk. Wan Hai reported that a salvage team boarded the vessel when it reached the Gulf of Oman after a nearly 1,800 nautical mile tow from the position off India and Sri Lanka, where the vessel was held offshore after the fire began on June 9. They reported that the inspection team took measurements of the cargo holds and compartments, and that monitoring showed no signs of smoke or further container displacement. The assessments indicated that the vessel’s stability and structural integrity are secure, with no immediate risks identified. The vessel is expected to undergo further inspections and complete the requirements of the authorities so that it can be berthed. Wan Hai reports that container inspection and unloading operations are expected to begin in October. The fire began on June 9 while the vessel was 54 nautical miles off the west coast of India on a voyage from Sri Lanka. The ship was evacuated, with 18 crewmembers rescued and four reported as missing and presumed deceased from the explosions and fire aboard the vessel. The firefighting efforts continued for more than a month, and the cargo continued to smolder in one hold in particular well into August. Salvage teams had been able to board the vessel and had begun dewatering the engine room and other areas. Despite the reports that the vessel was stable, Indian officials rejected berthing the vessel and later ordered it to be towed from the Indian EEZ. Registered in Singapore, oversight of the incident was eventually handed over to Singapore’s Maritime & Ports Authority while the search for a port of refuge continued. The salvage team reportedly explored Sri Lanka as well as possibly towing the vessel east to Malaysia or Singapore before settling on the trip across the Arabian Sea to the UAE. The last pictures of the vessel were in July after the fire was extinguished. Having started midship, the fire appeared to have destroyed boxes from the aft deckhouse forward to nearly the bow, with possibly a few on the bow not charred. A few boxes were loaded on the stern of the vessel and appear to have been shielded from the spread of the fire by the deck house. Built in 2005, the 51,300-dwt vessel was loaded with approximately 1,750 TEU when the fire broke out. It was believed to have started in one of the holds. The authorities reported that 143 of the containers were listed on the manifest as containing hazardous materials. Reports indicated that between 10 and 15 containers were seen floating in the ocean, but most remained aboard and were incinerated in the fire. Wan Hai, in providing its update, also thanked the authorities, partners, and professional teams that assisted throughout the long effort.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 04:26:35

Japanese Team Conducts World's First Railgun Test Shot at a Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/japanese-team-conducts-world-s-first-railgun-test-shot-at-a-vessel,,12/09/2025 02:27:20,,"Japan's navy has persisted in the pursuit of a usable, durable electromagnetic railgun, continuing a hunt that the U.S. Navy has (for public purposes) abandoned. Its Acquisition Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA) has recently conducted what it believes to be the first successful test firing of a railgun at a target vessel in the world, and has released images of the trial shots. The weapon is mounted on the bow of the test vessel JS Asuka, operating out of Yokosuka. Tests appear to have been conducted against targets on a small workboat at a position off the coast. ATLA did not provide further details of the results. # #  # !# # pic.twitter.com/WrFaLZpbD2 Conceptually, railguns offer tantalizing benefits for the warfighter. Compared to a conventional cannon, the rounds are smaller, cheaper, and are made of inert pieces of metal. This means that the ship's magazines can fit in more rounds per cubic foot, and they are impossible to detonate in the event of a casualty. Unlike lasers and microwave systems - which get lumped together with railguns as ""directed energy weapons"" - railgun rounds are physical objects with a ballistic trajectory, unaffected by smoke or rain. Since they go up and come down again, they can be fired at warships or shore targets out of sight, beyond the curvature of the horizon - which lasers by definition cannot do. Technologists hope that these rounds could also be swift and accurate enough to counter hypersonic missile threats in an air-defense role. In practice, getting a railgun to work aboard a vessel has proven to be a difficult assignment. Ejecting a piece of tungsten from the gun at 4,500 knots generates tremendous heat and force, which tends to burn out the barrel at a rapid pace. The guns also take a huge amount of power to operated - hence the prioritization of use on ships, where it is easier to arrange for the sheer mass of the power supply.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 09:30:22

U.S. Launches Largest Sanction Action Against Houthis,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-launches-largest-sanction-action-against-houthis,,12/09/2025 00:45:58,,"In its continuing efforts to pressure the militants in Yemen, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control launched the largest sanction action to date targeting the Houthis. The effort included 32 individuals and entities, as well as four tankers, all of which the U.S. contends are part of a global network involved in fundraising, smuggling, and weapons procurement operations. The U.S. has previously targeted leaders in the Houthi movement as well as its financial network. The new action the U.S. reports targeted finance and those who facilitate the Houthis’ acquisition of advanced military-grade materials. They said the network is involved in helping to supply ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drone components. “The Houthis continue to threaten U.S. personnel and assets in the Red Sea, attack our allies in the region, and undermine international maritime security in coordination with the Iranian regime,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley. “We will continue applying maximum pressure against those who threaten the security of the United States and the region.” The U.S. says the Houthis generate substantial revenue by importing oil and other commodities through ports under their control, overseeing complex smuggling operations, and laundering vast sums of money. The proceeds from these illicit activities, the U.S. said, finance the Houthis’ global weapons supply chain, which relies on procurement operatives, front companies, shipping facilitators, and various suppliers. United Arab Emirates-based Tyba Ship Management DMCC, owned by a Houthi-linked businessman, Muhammad Al-Sunaydar, is among the targets of the new actions. Tyba, they report, operates the Barbados-flagged Star MM and Antigua and Barbuda-flagged Nobel M oil tankers, which discharged oil at Houthi-controlled port Ras Isa. Tyba also operates the Panama-flagged Black Rock and Antigua and Barbuda-flagged Shria oil tankers and was linked to companies in the Marshall Islands, which are the registered owners of the Nobel M, Star MM, and Shria. The sanctions also targeted a series of China-based companies, which the U.S. said are fronts for the Houthis and are organizing shipments. One, they said, was involved with shipping hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical precursors used to manufacture motors for ballistic missiles and explosives. Another they said was coordinating large-scale procurement and shipment of UAV components and other items from China used in weapons manufacturing. The actions come as the Houthis have escalated their threats and increased the attacks on Israel. The Israeli military responded with attacks on Wednesday that it said targeted military sites in Sanaa and al-Jawf province. Among its targets, the Israelis said, was ""the Houthis' military public relations headquarters."" The Houthis claimed to have mounted a defense, which they said caused some of the Israeli jets to turn back. Attacks against shipping, however, appear to be in another lull.

China's First Catapult-Equipped Carrier is Nearly Ready for Service,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-first-catapult-equipped-carrier-is-nearly-ready-for-service,,12/09/2025 00:37:45,,"On Thursday, Japanese forces made their first sighting of China's third and newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, operating in the East China Sea. It transited southbound through the Taiwan Strait and into the South China Sea, prompting speculation about whether it is about to formally enter service. China's first two carriers were adapted Soviet-era designs with ski jump ramps at the bow. Fujian is much different: the ship has electromagnetic catapults, a technology previously found only aboard the U.S. Navy's Ford-class carriers. China's military says that Fujian is the largest conventionally-powered warship afloat. Fujian is to undergo testing and training exercises in the South China Sea, accompanied by the destroyers Hangzhou and Jinan, according to Chinese state media. ""The cross-regional tests and training are a routine mission of the carrier’s construction process,"" a spokesperson said. Commissioning is expected within about one month after, according to state media, based on the test-and-delivery timeline for previous carrier Shandong. ""Only those with ill intentions would feel nervous"" about the carrier's presence, Chinese military commentator Fu Qianshao told state outlet Global Times.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 09:30:22
Norse Ship Management Deploys Inmarsat Nexuswave To Enhance Experience,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/norse-ship-management-deploys-inmarsat-nexuswave-to-enhance-experience,,12/09/2025 00:35:32,,"[By: Inmarsat Maritime] Inmarsat Maritime, a Viasat (NASDAQ: VSAT) company, together with distribution partner Station Satcom have secured an order to install NexusWave on a bulk carrier managed by Singapore-based Norse Ship Management as the ship manager looks to meet the growing demands for crew and business connectivity across its fleet. In line with Norse Ship Management’s digitalisation objectives, NexusWave provides uninterrupted remote access to business-critical applications and real-time engine-monitoring, ensuring seamless data exchange between ship and shore. The fully managed bonded connectivity service offers unlimited data and global coverage, enabling the crew to experience a home-like internet on board, where web-based applications perform as smoothly as they do on land. Capt. Akshay Yadava, Managing Director, Norse Ship Management, said: “Crew welfare is our top priority, and providing a home-like internet experience onboard is increasingly vital to keeping our crews happy and motivated. With growing traffic demands on the commercial side and the need to ensure consistent, high-speed connectivity, we have selected NexusWave to upgrade our current system. We look forward to a continued successful collaboration with Station Satcom.” NexusWave’s unique network bonding technology is designed to allow applications to leverage the combined speed and capacity of all available network underlays simultaneously, rather than relying on a single network at a time. This means ship owners and managers benefit from reliable, secure, and high-performance connectivity. Anshul Khanna, Director Station Satcom Private Limited, said: “We are proud to be entrusted by Norse Ship Management to deliver NexusWave across its fleet. This partnership reflects Station Satcom’s commitment to enabling smarter, safer, and more connected maritime operations. Our integrated deployment approach ensures Norse benefits from a single, robust platform tailored to its evolving digital needs.” Justin Yi, Regional Director, Inmarsat Maritime, said “Norse Ship Management’s decision to adopt NexusWave highlights its forward-thinking approach to digitalisation, with a clear commitment to enhancing crew welfare and operational efficiency. We extend our thanks to Station Satcom for its expert support in successfully delivering this deployment.” Designed to meet the evolving needs of Inmarsat Maritime’s customers, NexusWave will be enhanced with the forthcoming integration of the next-generation ultra-high capacity ViaSat-3 Ka-band network – a move that will further boost speed and capacity.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 09:30:22
DNV & HD KSOE Collaborate on Next-Gen Operator Training Solution,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/dnv-hd-ksoe-collaborate-on-next-gen-operator-training-solution,,12/09/2025 00:18:50,,"DNV and HD KSOE have announced a strategic collaboration to deploy a next-generation digital twin-based Operator Training Solution (HiDTS-OTS), successfully demonstrated at Gastech. The solution is designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. The HiDTS-OTS (Hyundai Intelligent Digital Twin Ship – Operator Training Solution) connects via application programming interface (API) to the simulations of specialized system models running in the DNV Simulation Trust Center (STC), a scalable and secure cloud-based environment for running system simulations. This architecture enables realistic, scenario-based training tailored to specific vessel configurations. By leveraging the web-based DNV STC platform, HiDTS-OTS provides global accessibility, allowing easy and scalable deployment across training centres and fleets worldwide. Each training module features high-fidelity simulation, built around a dedicated system model and target control system, ensuring vessel-specific accuracy and operational relevance. The system models are verified by DNV in accordance with the DNV Recommended Practice for the Assurance of Simulation Models (DNV-RP-0513), ensuring reliability and credibility for dedicated scenarios such as failure modes and normal operation of the control system. HiDTS-OTS also supports training for complex and potentially hazardous operations, such as ammonia fuel handling, contributing to the safer adoption of alternative fuels. Hongryeul Ryu, Chief Technology Officer, HD HHI, said: ""Next-generation eco-friendly vessel solutions can maximize their performance through appropriate operating environments and systematic management, and this requires strong support from crew training. Therefore, the OTS serves as a core component in realizing these solutions, playing a critical role in delivering greater value to shipowners while supporting safer and more efficient vessel operations.” Byoung Hun Kwon, Executive Vice President / Head of the Digital Technology Research Lab, HD KSOE, explained: ""The shortage of seafarers in the shipping industry is becoming increasingly critical, and digital twin technology is emerging as a key solution to this challenge. Leveraging the long-standing partnership between HD Hyundai and DNV in ship digital twin technologies, crew training will be advanced into a data-, control-, and experience-driven competency management system equivalent to real vessel operations."" Vidar Dolonen, Regional Manager for Korea & Japan, DNV Maritime, added: ""This collaboration marks a significant step forward in maritime digitalization and safety. By combining DNV’s simulation assurance expertise with HD Hyundai’s operational knowledge, we are reinforcing the standards that underpin safe and effective training. It reflects our continued focus on helping to prepare the next generation of seafarers for a more complex operational landscape.""

"24 Years After 9/11, Mariners Remember World's Biggest Emergency Boatlift",https://maritime-executive.com/article/24-years-after-9-11-mariners-remember-world-s-biggest-emergency-boatlift,,11/09/2025 23:39:50,,"When terrorists used two aircraft to hit New York City's Twin Towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, 2,700 people lost their lives in both buildings and the city suffered a terrible blow - a defining moment for generations of New Yorkers, and a moment of heroism for first responders. After the attacks, survivors streamed out into the streets. By 1030 that morning, both towers had collapsed, enveloping the area in toxic dust. This cloud effectively trapped hundreds of thousands of people in Lower Manhattan. Coastguardsmen and civilian mariners answered the call and provided a massive sealift evacuation, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Under the leadership of Lt. Mike Day (USCG), Coast Guard units organized more than 100 good samaritan boats and five Coast Guard cutters in a mission to carry survivors across the harbor, balancing safety rules with the urgent need to complete the evacuation. About 800 mariners rescued about 500,000 people from the waterfront in the largest waterborne evacuation of all time, larger even than Dunkirk. ""The first plane struck the first tower and we all thought it was a terrible accident. There was not much information coming in, nobody had a smartphone,"" remembered ferry boat captain Rick Thornton in a Fox News interview. ""Once the second plane struck the second tower, we knew it was some sort of coordinated attack, and the entire New York Waterway fleet just jumped into action. . . . There was tens of thousands of people stranded. And some of them were jumping into the river and swimming. We had to pick some of them out of the water, and then we nosed up against a seawall which wasn't even a ferry dock."" “The look of fear on the faces of the people I transported that day will be in my memory forever,"" boat skipper Warren Ihde said at a local remembrance ceremony for survivors, according to local outlet WWAY. ""People were covered in dust and were ghostly looking, many were tourists and kept asking ‘where are you taking me and how am I going to get home.'"" By delivering the survivors across the river, the good Samaritans got them out of the toxic dust plume of 9/11 debris - but also exposed themselves in the process. During parts of the evacuation, the dust was so thick that navigation had to be done by radar. Many of the mariners on scene that day have suffered 9/11-associated ailments like cancer and lung disease. The heroism they showed - and the price that many paid - must be remembered, according to Thornton. ""We can't lose sight of what happened that day and the courage of a lot of regular people doing extraordinary things,"" he said.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 09:30:22

Testimony Completed in Eagle S Sabotage Trial in Finland,https://maritime-executive.com/article/testimony-completed-in-eagle-s-sabotage-trial-in-finland,,12/09/2025 17:07:56,,"Prosecutors and defense lawyers made their final statements on Friday, September 12, in Helsinki District Court in the trial of the captain and two officers from the product tanker Eagle S on charges that their negligence caused the damage on December 25, 2024, of five subsea cables running between Finland and Estonia. After broad speculation that it was a case of sabotage, the prosecution centered on the command responsibilities, citing negligence and not pursuing charges of intentional damage to the cables. The captain, first, and second officers of the product tanker were charged with aggravated sabotage and aggravated interference with telecommunications as a result of the anchor-dragging incident. The trial began on August 25, and the court is now scheduled to issue its ruling on October 3. The three officers of the vessel have been subjected to a travel ban since January 2025 that did not permit them to leave Finland. Others from the crew that had initially been under investigation were removed from the travel ban. The court, however, today, also ruled to lift the travel ban on the captain and two officers. Prosecutors had argued it should remain in place until the verdict. The case centered on whether the captain and officers should have realized that the anchor dropped and was being dragged. Investigators concluded it dropped because of poor maintenance and a broken safety pin on the chain stopper. The defense lawyers countered that the anchor windless had been serviced and tested, and further, it had withstood violent storms before the ship entered the Gulf of Finland. The prosecution contended that they should have realized there was a problem because the vessel’s speed dropped when the anchor began dragging. The defense was that they believed it was an engine problem that caused the speed drop. In their closing remarks, the prosecution contended to the court that no evidence was presented of engine problems. The captain, they said, is responsible for the management and condition of the ship while the two officers were on navigation watch during the time the anchor dragged 90 kilometers (55 miles) along the seabed and broke five cables. Defense said it was the chief engineer, who was not on trial, who was responsible for the condition of the machinery, including the anchor. Further, they questioned why the Finnish authorities had not informed the vessel sooner when they suspected it was dragging the anchor. There also remains an issue of jurisdiction, and whether the vessel voluntarily entered Finnish waters. The defense argues that Finland lacked the authority because the damage occurred in international waters and the ship only entered Finnish waters when it was commanded by the police. Prosecutors are still asking the court to sentence each of the three officers to a minimum of two and a half years in prison. The Finnish news outlet Yle says the leniency of the proposed sentences is because the cables were not intentionally broken and the overall damage was “quite minor.” The companies reported it took a few months to complete repairs at a cost of approximately €55 million ($65 million). The incident, however, raised concerns over the safety of key infrastructure. It was followed by several other suspicious events, which led to allegations that it was part of an orchestrated plot by Russia. NATO and the Scandinavian countries increased monitoring of key assets as a result of the suspicions regarding the actions of the Eagle S.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 21:24:51
Ukraine Damages Russia’s Primorsk Oil Terminal in Large Drone Assualt,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-damages-russia-s-primorsk-oil-terminal-in-large-drone-assualt,,12/09/2025 14:59:26,,"Ukraine launched one of the largest drone assaults of the war, targeting multiple areas in Russia, including the first attack on the Primorsk oil terminal, Russia’s largest facility on the Baltic. Other reports indicate damage at the Ust-Luga terminal with Russian officials contending the attacks were targeting the facilities of Lukoil. The Governor of the Leningrad Region confirmed the attack posting on social media warning residents to remain indoors. At first, Alexander DroZdenko said more than 20 UAVs had been destroyed, and later increased the estimate to more than 30 UAVs. There were reports of debris at various points across the region. DroZdenko confirmed that there was a fire on one of the vessels in the port of Primorsk and later said it had been extinguished. He also confirmed a fire at a pumping station. He said there were no casualties, but reports indicate operations had been suspended at Primorsk. Primorsk is a key part of Russian oil exports. At the terminus of the Baltic Pipeline System, it is reported to have 18 storage tanks with a total capacity of 900,000 tons of crude. Other parts of the facility handle light petroleum products. The terminal is reported to have an annual volume of 58 million tons. Unconfirmed claims from unidentified sources at the Security Service of Ukraine told The Kyiv Independent that three pumping stations for the Ust-Luga port terminal were also damaged. It would be the second attack on that terminal in a matter of weeks. Russian officials are claiming that a total of 221 Ukrainian drones were downed in a dozen locations across the country. Air Traffic at St. Petersburg’s airport was also delayed or diverted during the attack, which began on Thursday night and continued past midnight in the Leningrad region. It is being reported as one of the largest attacks staged by Ukraine since the start of the war three and a half years ago. Ukrainian officials have said the attacks are in retaliation for Russia’s increased attacks and that they are targeting the income-producing oil sector. At the end of August, Ukraine attacked the Ust-Luga terminal with reports that as much as half of its capacity was taken offline. The White House later said that it also believed 20 percent of Russia’s oil refining capacity had been disabled during August. Russian officials recently revised their estimates for oil shipments during the current month. Reuters reported that the plan called for shipping 2.1 million barrels per day, which would be an 11 percent increase over the original plan.",Maritime Executive,12/09/2025 21:24:51

Historic 1927 USCG Cutter McLane Sold for Scrap by Michigan Museum,https://maritime-executive.com/article/historic-1927-uscg-cutter-mclane-sold-for-scrap-by-michigan-museum,,12/09/2025 23:45:25,,"A U.S Coast Guard cutter built in 1927 that has been part of the USS Silversides Submarine Museum exhibits in Muskegon, Michigan, for years, has been towed away and will be scrapped. The decision came following what the museum said was significant deterioration that made efforts towards continuous preservation unfeasible. The museum announced on September 10 that after thoughtful deliberation, it had made the difficult decision to deaccession the cutter McLane from its permanent collections. The cutter has been part of exhibits for over three decades, having been moored at Muskegon harbor since 1993. The 38-meter (125-foot) Active-class patrol cutter was commissioned in 1927 and served the USGC with distinction through multiple eras of the agency’s history. She was named after Louis McLane, who was appointed U.S. Secretary of State in 1833. Part of McLane’s active duty was patrolling the waters of the Territory of Alaska, including the Bering Strait, during World War II. Decommissioned in 1968, McLane was donated to the USS Silversides Submarine Museum in 1993, where she has been offering visitors a glimpse into life aboard a patrol vessel. However, the vessel’s deteriorating condition had progressed, the museum says, to the point of being inaccessible for public touring. Maintenance concerns have seen the vessel closed to the public since spring of this year. The museum has now decided that it has further made her continued presence in the harbor untenable. The museum highlighted that while it has made efforts to explore alternative preservation options, the vessel’s conditions have meant that continued stewardship was no longer sustainable. It believes that with the cold season approaching, the combination of time, weather, and structural decline made timely action necessary to ensure the safety of the vessel and the surrounding environment. Unable to continue preserving the vessel, the cutter was sold for scrap. King Towing undertook the task of towing the cutter from the harbor, while Pitsch Companies will handle the dismantling. USS Silversides, a WWII vintage submarine (USS Silversides Submarine Museum) To honor McLane’s legacy, all historical artifacts and interpretive materials housed aboard the vessel were removed to ensure their continued educational and historical value. These artifacts will now be part of the broader collection at the museum and shared with partner organizations. “The McLane had been a symbol of service and strength for decades,” said Veronica Campbell, USS Silversides Submarine Museum, Executive Director. “Though it was difficult to say goodbye, we were incredibly grateful to our community partners who helped us navigate this transition with dignity and respect.” Following the departure of McLane, the museum that originally opened as the Great Lakes Naval Memorial and Museum now intends to put its main focus on its main exhibit, the USS Silversides submarine. Part of the efforts will involve fundraising to support the restoration of Silversides. Commissioned in December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the submarine embarked on her first war patrol in April of the following year, and went on to complete 14 war patrols in the Pacific during WWII. She was decommissioned in 1946 and became a stationary training ship in Chicago until 1969. After retiring from service, she spent time in Chicago as a museum ship, moving to Navy Pier in 1979. In 1987, Silversides was towed across Lake Michigan to become part of the Great Lakes Naval and Memorial Museum.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
CBP Intercepts Stolen Bulldozer Being Smuggled Out at the Port of Baltimore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cbp-intercepts-stolen-bulldozer-being-smuggled-out-at-the-port-of-baltimore,,12/09/2025 23:04:38,,"Criminal syndicates stealing vehicles in the U.S. and shipping them to countries in West Africa are becoming daring, reports U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Its officers were recently surprised when they found a stolen bulldozer being smuggled out of the Port of Baltimore was destined for Ghana. Officers stationed at CBP’s Area Port of Baltimore are among the busiest when it comes to intercepting stolen vehicles, the bureau reports. Often, they are being smuggled out of the U.S., hidden in containers. The stolen vehicles are mostly SUVs, sedans, vans, and pickup trucks. Last year, the Baltimore Field Office ranked second nationally in terms of stolen vehicle recoveries. On September 3, however, they encountered something that was a bit unusual. The officers were inspecting an export shipment and discovered a 2015 Caterpillar D8T bulldozer valued at about $237,000. It was in the process of being shipped to Ghana, a West African nation that CBP reports is a popular destination for stolen vehicles. While conducting a routine export examination on the dozer, officers discovered that the vehicle identification number (VIN) matched a stolen vehicle report from Carroll County, Maryland. They contacted the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office and confirmed that the theft report remained active, resulting in the seizure of the dozer. CBP says that the seizure of the bulldozer is an indication that criminal syndicates involved in exporting stolen vehicles from the U.S. are becoming daring. West Africa, specifically Nigeria and Ghana, they report are lucrative markets for the stolen vehicles. Last year, about 60 percent, or 151 of the 250 stolen vehicles that officers in the Baltimore Field Office recovered, were destined for West African nations. The 250 recovered stolen vehicles were collectively valued at $9.6 million Nigeria was the top destination with officers recovering 70 vehicles destined for the country, representing 28 percent of all vehicle recoveries. A total of 28 vehicles were earmarked for shipping to Ghana. CBP reports that during each of the previous five years, over 90 percent of recovered stolen vehicles were destined to West African nations. “Customs and Border Protection officers continue to combat transnational criminal organizations by interrupting the international trade in stolen vehicles at our seaports,” said Jason Kropiewnicki, CBP’s Acting Area Port Director in Baltimore. “We will continue to secure our nation’s borders, recover stolen vehicle exports, and work with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to hold these criminal organizations accountable.” Despite efforts to fight the crime, CBP highlights that national volumes of stolen vehicle export recoveries remain on the rise. In 2024, the agency recovered 1,445 stolen vehicles, about 10 percent more than in 2023, and 81 percent higher than in 2021.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
Norway Seizes Russian Fishing Vessel That Overstayed Its Welcome,https://maritime-executive.com/article/norway-seizes-russian-fishing-vessel-that-overstayed-its-welcome,,12/09/2025 22:41:02,,"The Norwegian government announced today, September 12, that after months of trying to get a Russian-owned fishing vessel to leave its port, it has resorted to seizing the vessel. The government reports it will take into consideration outstanding claims from the Port of Batsfjord, but it wants the vessel out of the port immediately. The saga of the 39-meter (128-foot) long fishing boat Azurit began when it docked in the Port of Batsfjord, a remote fishing village on Norway’s north coast along the Barents Sea. The vessel is registered in Russia with a home port of St. Petersburg and ownership reported to a company called Oceanprom. The vessel received some repairs from a local company, but appears to have failed to pay its bills and was detained with a crew remaining aboard. Norway changed its regulations limiting access for Russian vessels to its ports starting in 2022 and again in 2024. Access was limited to just three ports: Kirkenes, Batsfjord, and Tromsø, and some Russian companies were entirely denied fishing permits. Further, Russian vessels can only stay in Norwegian ports for five days. The government later asserted that financial claims were not a reason for vessels to remain in port beyond the time limit. ""This vessel must be removed from Båtsfjord harbour. After considering and trying various solutions, it was now absolutely necessary to make a decision on the state takeover of the vessel. The Norwegian Coastal Administration can thus implement all necessary measures to remove it,"" said Minister of Fisheries and the Oceans Marianne Sivertsen Naess. Saying that the prolonged stay in Batsfjord harbor was “considered to pose a risk of national security interests being threatened,” Norway expelled the vessel on December 6 telling it that it must depart within five days. At the time, the captain told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that they were confused because they had a detention order and an eviction notice. The ship simply never left. The Ministry reported that it considered and tried various solutions, including possibly towing the vessel. The police took steps to secure and control the vessel, but it still never left. Media reports indicate it now owes as much as $200,000 to the port and various local businesses. The vessel is also reported to be in poor condition. NRK reports the state will cover the berthing fees. Norway’s Secretary of State Kristoffer André Hansen said that he expects the vessel will likely be towed to a local shipyard and dismantled.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18

While the company continues its role as a leading container carrier, it is also following a strategy to expand its dry bulk operations as a means of stabilizing its financial results. The company announced the signing of a new long-term contract of affreightment (COA) with Brazil’s Vale, one of the world’s largest mining companies. Valued at approximately $310 million, the contract is for ten years, starting in the second quarter of 2026, for the transport of iron ore using five bulk carriers. It follows a similar 10-year contract completed in May with Vale valued at more than $450 million. “Through portfolio diversification, we aim to achieve balanced growth across various markets and secure new opportunities for long-term growth,” HMM reported while announcing the new contract. It is the strategic partnership with Vale is expected to provide stable cargo volumes and consistent revenue over the next decade. The company highlights it has been active in the dry bulk and construction material sectors since 1977 and today operates general cargo vessels in various sizes from 30,000 DWT Handy to 60,000 DWT Supramax worldwide, including in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. Its current fleet list shows a total of 20 dry bulk carriers: 7 Capesize, 2 Panamax, 4 Supramax, and 7 Handy. HMM highlights that it plans to expand its bulk fleet to 110 vessels (12.56 million DWT) by 2030, as part of its strategy to diversify beyond container shipping and pursue new growth opportunities. As part of this strategy, the company recently took delivery of the eco-friendly Ocean Ariel, a 42,000 dwt bulker built by Japan’s Tsuneishi Shipbuilding. The shipbuilder highlights that it is a versatile design primarily for the three major bulk cargoes of iron ore, grain, and coal, but it can also carry lumber, hot coils, and sulfur, allowing for greater trade flexibility. It uses a semi-box-type hold that is also suitable for transporting steel products. HMM, according to reports, is also pursuing secondhand dry bulk tonnage after it failed in its bid to acquire the bulk operations of South Korea’s SK Shipping. The company in 2022 launched its new long-term strategy, reporting it would invest $10 billion to grow its operations. Its objective is to nearly double its container capacity to 1.2 million TEU while accelerating growth in the bulker segments. It has also ordered four new multi-purpose vessels and ordered car carriers that will operate under a long-term charter to Hyundai-Glovis. The company is also seeking growth in logistics, with reports that it is planning investments in terminals around the world.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
Interior Department and Maryland Offshore Wind File Counterclaims in Court,https://maritime-executive.com/article/interior-department-and-maryland-offshore-wind-file-counter-claims-in-court,,12/09/2025 20:21:45,,"The legal battle over Maryland’s planned offshore wind project is heating up as the United States followed through on its earlier statement and filed to vacate the Construction and Operation permit granted in late 2024 to US Wind. Anticipating the move after earlier statements of intent by the Department of Justice, the offshore wind developer has already filed claims with the courts to block the moves by the Trump administration. Maryland’s WBOC News broke the story, reporting that the Department of Justice filed on Friday afternoon, September 12, as expected to vacate the permits granted by the Biden administration. The government had declared its intent at the end of August in another court filing. The U.S. is party to a lawsuit filed by government officials in Ocean City, Maryland, seeking to block the project, the first of two US Wind was to develop on its offshore lease. Maryland Wind was the tenth commercial-scale offshore wind project approved by the Biden administration. It calls for up to 114 wind turbines that would bring power ashore in Maryland and Delaware. The plan calls for 1,700 MW of offshore wind power generation capacity. US Wind, which is owned by funds managed by Apollo Global Management, an American investment firm, and Renexia, a subsidiary of Toto Holding, had received all of its permits from the federal government as well as both Maryland and Delaware. Today’s court filing, WBOC reports, cites “substantial concerns” about the review and approval process for the project. It specifically points to what it says is a lack of mitigation efforts to prevent impact on Maryland’s fishing industries. Ocean City, which is a popular tourist destination, has also opposed the project, saying it would hurt its business and reduce the number of visitors. US Wind moved at the beginning of September in anticipation of the Trump administration’s actions after DOJ declared its intent to challenge the permits. The company filed a cross claim in Maryland court, saying that the effort was politically motivated. They asserted that the president, his appointees, members of Congress, and the opponents had been unfairly pressuring the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to cancel the licenses. The company, in its filing, asserted that the federal defendants failed to explain their action and the reversal of earlier government policies that supported the development. Earlier this week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum declared the U.S. offshore wind industry dead. According to a report by Bloomberg, Burgum said the U.S. was reviewing five projects, and he also cited the withdrawal of tax credits and other subsidies. The U.S. has also recently ordered a stop work on the installation of Revolution Wind, being developed by Ørsted. It also declared its intent to challenge the permits for Massachusetts’ SouthCoast Wind being developed by Ocean Wind North America, a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie, and New England Wind, which is being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. In addition to the case filed by US Wind in Maryland, Ørsted also filed suit to force the stop work ordered to be lifted on its project, which is already 80 percent installed. A coalition of US states also filed a suit challenging the federal review of the wind energy sector ordered by Donald Trump.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
Salvage Master on Way to Cargo Ship Grounded in Remote Canadian Arctic,https://maritime-executive.com/article/salvage-master-on-way-to-cargo-ship-grounded-in-remote-canadian-arctic,,12/09/2025 20:17:00,,"Nearly a week after the Dutch cargo ship Thamesborg grounded in a remote part of the Canadian Arctic during a trip on the Northwest Passage, a salvage master and naval architect were due to reach the vessel. They are working on a plan for the ship, which is reportedly stable but has taken on water in multiple ballast tanks. The operator Royal Wagenborg, said the salvage team would reach the vessel by the end of the week. In addition, the Canadian Coast Guard vessel CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier is being used to transport personnel and equipment to the remote site. The Canadian Coast Guard reported that an underwater survey was completed on September 8 using ROVs two days after the vessel went aground. The 21,359 dwt vessel was sailing from China to Baie-Comeau, Quebec, and is carrying a load of carbon blocks used for manufacturing in heavy industry. The ship went aground in the Franklin Strait in Nunavut. A crew of 15 people is aboard the vessel along with a Canadian ice pilot. There were no injuries, but they are stranded in a remote part of Canada, away from any large settlements. The survey of the hull confirmed the damage to the ballast tanks, but the fuel tanks do not appear to be damaged, and there was no flooding in the cargo holds. A second Canadian Coast Guard vessel, CCGS Jean Goodwill, has remained on scene. The Canadian Coast Guard reports the vessel's owner and the salvage master have organized additional equipment and personnel. Currently, the damage is being analyzed to develop the salvage plan. The Thamesborg, built in 2013, is 564 feet (174 meters) in length. The ship, which is registered in the Netherlands, was inspected in Canada in March 2024 and 2025 with no issues reported. It has an ice class. Media reports from Canada highlight that only 18 percent of Canada’s Arctic waters have been mapped with modern technology. Much of the Northwest Passage, they note, lacks modern charts. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada revealed in an announcement yesterday that this is the second grounding of the season in the same general eastern area of the Northwest Passage. It reported that an investigation team is on its way to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, to interview the crew of another cargo ship, the Rosaire A. Desgagnés (12,776 dwt). The vessel, which is registered in Canada, went aground on August 23 in Pelly Bay, Nunavut. The location is to the south of where the Thamesborg is stranded, and unlike the current situation, the vessel was refloated with the tide. It was conducting a supply mission to the region and was inspected for damage after it was refloated. It is expected to reach St. John’s over the weekend.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
UK Adds 70 Tankers to Russian Sanctions Along with Electronics Suppliers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-adds-70-tankers-to-russian-sanctions-along-with-electronics-suppliers,,12/09/2025 20:00:06,,"The UK expanded its list of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil and gas industry as well as suppliers of electronics and other military components. The latest round of sanctions came as the UK’s new Foreign Secretary made her visit to Kyiv. With the new action, the UK again claims the position as the country with the most sanctioned tankers. The long list includes vessels that have previously been listed by the United States, as well as targeting Russian majors, including Sovcomflot, Rosneft, and Gazprom. Among the ships are the Vasily Dinkov (72,700 dwt), which was introduced in 2008 by Sovcomflot as the first of three new Arctic enhanced ice-class tankers, designed to transport oil from the Varandey oil field within the Arctic Circle. There are also multiple vessels linked to Gazprom, including a gas tanker, Gazpromneft Zuid East (6,897), which was previously listed by the United States. The UK highlighted that it continues to lead the charge against the shadow fleet. It said the goal is to reduce sources of revenue. The UK is now approaching 500 listed tankers, having already listed 423 tankers, a dramatic increase from just over 100 tankers sanctioned at the start of 2025. The EU, by comparison, currently has sanctions on 444 tankers, while the U.S. lags at just over 200 tankers from the Russian shadow fleet. “International action to increase economic pressure on Russia and to cut off critical cash flows which he desperately needs to pay for this illegal war is vital,” said Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. “These sanctions form the next stage in the UK’s leading efforts to ramp up economic pressure alongside our security support and our work alongside the Coalition of the Willing for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.” She noted that Russia, in the last two weeks, has again moved to obstruct the US-led peace efforts by launching the largest air attack of the war against Ukraine. They noted that over 800 missiles and drones were fired in a single night and over 6,500 in July. Attacks, they said, are a level ten times that of a year ago. In addition to the tankers, the UK added 30 entities and individuals that it says are propping up Russia’s war machine. They said the companies were being targeted for supplying key equipment such as electronics, chemicals, and explosives used to manufacture missiles and other weapons systems. In addition to listing companies in Russia, the UK also targeted others supplying the effort. This included companies based in China and Turkey. They were also linked to electronics widely used in Russian weaponry, including drones and missiles.",Maritime Executive,13/09/2025 04:23:18
Human Element Is Key As Information Overload Emerges As New Risk,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/human-element-is-key-as-information-overload-emerges-as-new-risk,,12/09/2025 19:55:54,,"[By: Inmarsat Maritime] The 2025 edition of the Future of Maritime Safety Report from Inmarsat Maritime, a Viasat (NASDAQ: VSAT) company, reveals that distress calls at sea remain high, underlining the vital role of human factors in safe shipping. According to the report, the number of Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) distress calls registered on the Inmarsat Maritime network increased from 788 in 2023 to 801 in 2024, broadly in line with the 2018-2023 annual average of around 800 calls. The report points to a turbulent year for international shipping, with geopolitical instability, conflict, severe weather events, piracy, and cyber-attacks all adding pressure on operators and crews. Alongside these risks, seafarers are facing welfare challenges linked to the pace and volume of new technologies. While digitalisation and decarbonisation are essential for the industry’s future, the rapid implementation of new systems and reporting requirements has created an information ‘overload challenge’ for seafarers, highlighting the need for new technologies to support, rather than strain, crew welfare. The Future of Maritime Safety Report 2025 calls for the industry to acknowledge the fundamental role seafarer welfare plays in minimising the number of preventable incidents at sea. It recommends a ‘human factors’ approach to data that streamlines information, reduces duplication, and eliminates contradictory outputs. Peter Broadhurst, Senior Vice President, Safety and Regulatory, Inmarsat Maritime, said: “Accurate data holds immense potential to transform shipping safety – from predictive maintenance to casualty and near-miss reporting and human-factor analysis. But data must empower crews, not overwhelm them. We need smarter systems to capture, evaluate, and utilise data more effectively without placing an extra burden on already overworked seafarers.” Peter Broadhurst also emphasised the need for greater collaboration: “By sharing anonymised safety data, the industry can create a trusted ecosystem that strengthens standardisation and regulations, improves operations, and safeguards seafarer welfare. Together, we can create one of the most powerful maritime safety initiatives to navigate us through the pressures and changes impacting international shipping in the years to come.” Inmarsat invites maritime professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders to explore the findings of the Future of Maritime Safety Report 2025 report and to support collective action in safeguarding life at sea.

Libya Targets Economic Rebound Through Port Development,https://maritime-executive.com/article/libya-targets-economic-rebound-through-port-development,,14/09/2025 16:50:53,,"As part of the ongoing economic reforms, Libya has reported progress on the development of Sirte Port and its connecting infrastructure. During the peak of hostilities between forces of west and east Libya in 2016, Sirte was one of the fiercest battlegrounds. With tensions between the two Libyan governments tapering down, development initiatives appear to be resuming. Recently, the two governments closed ranks in a move to allow Turkey to proceed with exploration of oil and gas off Libya’s Mediterranean waters. Ports development is another area that has gained national consensus in Libya, viewed as an importunity to revitalize trade relations for the country. Sirte Port in central Libya is seen as one of the most strategic infrastructure initiatives. The port has potential to rekindle Libya’s trade with its landlocked neighbors including Chad, Mali and Niger. Sirte port resumed commercial operations in February after nearly 14 years of closure due to war in the region. The arrival of the general cargo ship Sea Horizon marked the reopening of the port. The vessel carrying construction materials and equipment for projects in Sirte Free Zone, arrived from Alexandria port in Egypt. Last month, Sirte Free Zone Authority (SFZA) announced notable progress in the construction of the “SSS” highway project. The $2 billion road project is expected to link Sirte port with key southern cities including Sabha and Sokna. The project is part of Libya’s Vision 2030 aimed at enhancing transportation between northern and southern Libya. In addition, it is envisioned that it will form a road corridor to the country’s landlocked neighbors. Notably, the project involves companies from Egypt and the UAE, signaling regional backing. The SSS project involves plans to install smart port system in Sirte, reportedly with Huawei’s support. There has also been significant progress in construction of specialized terminals. Early this month, Sirte port announced completion of its first dedicated bitumen unloading platform, which will support in the reconstruction efforts. Further, the port is celebrating increased commercial activity with docking of more vessels. Last week, the Turkish general cargo vessel Lutuf docked at the port. The vessel arrived from Turkey’s port of Gemlik and was carrying about 1,000 tons of goods.",Maritime Executive,14/09/2025 21:24:45
Countering China's Maritime Insurgency in the South Pacific,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/countering-china-s-maritime-insurgency-in-the-south-pacific,,14/09/2025 15:37:31,,"[By Jason Lancaster] Guadalcanal, the Coral Sea, Tarawa, New Guinea, and Iron Bottom Sound highlight the strategic location of the South Pacific during the Second World War. Today, U.S. and allied preeminence in this vital region is under threat. The People’s Republic of China (PRC,) through a sophisticated blend of economic inducements, political influence, and maritime coercion, is executing a campaign to erode U.S. and allied presence and reshape the Indo-Pacific order. Such activities mirror the tactics of insurgency, where control is gained not just through force, but by blurring legal boundaries, exploiting economic vulnerability, and using civilian fronts to advance strategic ends. The PRC’s maritime insurgency is not limited to the South China Sea. It is a global phenomenon. This maritime insurgency is not fought with gunfire but with corruption, development loans and aid, and the PRC’s deep-water fishing fleet. More than 17,000 vessels fishing throughout the world routinely engage in Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing (IUUF), often acting as a civilian vanguard for PRC state objectives. The situation is particularly acute in the South Pacific, where Chinese fishing fleets exploit the limited enforcement capacity of Pacific Island Countries (PICs), deplete sovereign marine resources, and undermine local economies, eroding governance, and sovereignty in the process. The South Pacific is by no means a strategic backwater. It lies astride the sea lines of communication connecting U.S. treaty allies in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia. It is home to key U.S. territories such as Guam and American Samoa. It includes the Compact of Free Association (COFA) states Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands. At its heart are the fourteen Pacific Island Countries. possess rich marine resources, and command strategic real estate that could either anchor regional stability or serve as launchpads for malign influence. Historically, the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand have been the region’s primary security and development partners. However, since 2018, the PRC has dramatically expanded its presence building dual-use infrastructure, embedding security arrangements, and offering opaque development assistance. Despite sustained Western aid to these nations, Beijing’s influence has surged. The construction of Chinese-funded ports and runways in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati. Long range missiles stationed in the Kiribati or the Solomons could threaten Hawaii, Australia, and the continental U.S., compromising freedom of navigation, eroding regional deterrence, and challenging the U.S. ability to defend treaty partners Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. IUUF is a major threat to PIC economies. Fishing is a major contributor to many PIC economies and IUUF challenges the ability of states to create revenue, further condemning them to a future of dependency on international development aid. The United States can enhance its hard power in the Indo-Pacific by utilizing soft power to counter IUUF and provide humanitarian assistance, thereby denying PRC regional influence. Countering IUUF The United States does not need to develop a new engagement strategy with South Pacific nations from whole cloth. The Pacific Island Forum produces its own strategic documents. Composed of 18 members and associate member states, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) serves as a unifying voice for the small states of the South Pacific. Australia and New Zealand are full members while U.S. territories Guam and American Samoa are associate members. The 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent and the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security articulate shared South Pacific security concerns and development goals. The United States and its allies are already adopting PIF strategic documents for engagement with Pacific Island Countries to achieve mutual successes. Countering IUUF and other forms of transnational crime is a top PIF priority, second only to climate change and rising sea levels. While the United States pays signatory nations US$60 million a year over ten years for the privilege of fishing within PIC Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, the PRC flagrantly disregards the sovereignty of Pacific Island states while plundering their maritime bounty. Pacific Island nations do not have the capacity to police their expansive EEZs against massive fishing fleets without assistance. Pacific Fusion Center The PIF’s 2018 Boe Declaration recommended various security proposals to defend PIF interests. One was the development of a Pacific Fusion Center to support the collation, sharing, and analysis of intelligence. The Pacific Island Forum stood up a Pacific Fusion Center in Vanuatu in 2021. The fusion center “enhances information sharing, cooperation, analysis and assessment, and expands situational awareness and capacity across the Pacific.” The fusion center provides an opportunity to expand multinational cooperation in the region and expand defense and security force capacity. To successfully counter transnational crime, the U.S. should support and increase the capacity of the Pacific Fusion Center with the mid-term goal of turning it into a maritime headquarters, increase the capacity to enforce PIC EEZs and laws, and increase regional maritime domain awareness fed into the Pacific Fusion Center. Through US associate PIF members Guam and American Samoa, the U.S should offer USCG support for the center to immediately increase its effectiveness. With a mid-term goal of creating a PIC-led multilateral maritime headquarters like the Combined Maritime Forces headquarters in Bahrain, this multinational maritime headquarters would be rotationally led by PICs with Australian, New Zealand, and U.S. support, and would have tactical control of forces regionally assigned to countering transnational crime. The Pacific Fusion Center will not be effective without forces at sea enabling maritime domain awareness (MDA). MDA supports two vital interests: enabling US, Australian, New Zealand, and local PIC forces to intercept and eliminate IUUF, and monitoring the PLAN in the region. IUUF fleets are vast. This was illustrated off South America, in February 2025, when the Argentine Navy tracked over 380 PRC flagged fishing vessels near the Argentine economic exclusion zone, requiring Argentina to send two warships and two aircraft—a sizable portion of its deployable blue water forces—to monitor these fishing vessels. The United States can support MDA through multiple asset types to identify potential threats within the maritime domain, supporting both the Pacific Fusion Center and a PIF response at sea. Improving Capacity Most PICs have little capability to enforce their own EEZs. Australia’s mitigation for the PIC’s lack of resources is the Pacific Maritime Security Program. This security assistance program provides Guardian-Class patrol boats, an equivalent of the USCG’s fast response cutter (FRC), along with crew training and maintenance for every PIC. The program has provided a total of 22 patrol boats over 30-year program. This effort has been a mixed success, as the region is full of marked and unmarked reefs and multiple ships have met with accidents. In December 2024 the new Fijian patrol boat RFNS Timo was damaged while docking. Timo is a replacement vessel for RFNS Puamau, which hit a reef and sank in June 2024. Timo completed her first patrol in April 2025. Despite this program many of these countries still do not have the capacity to patrol the entirety of their EEZs. The geography is a demanding one—the EEZ of Kiribati is roughly the size of the continental United States. The RAN and RNZN also have capacity issues. The RAN and RNZN serve dual functions, conducting both war at sea and law enforcement missions. The RNZN’s new force design will reduce the availability of RNZN vessels to conduct regional constabulary duties. The US Coast Guard (USCG) faces budgetary and ship number restrictions, but they are the regions preferred US service for cooperation. With local agreements, the USCG can help increase regional capacity. USCG District Oceania, formerly District 14’s area of responsibility is the Pacific with ships based in Honolulu and Guam. The USCG has two national security cutters, one medium endurance cutter, three Fast Response Cutters (FRCs), and three buoy tenders stationed in Honolulu, as well as three FRCs and a buoy tender based in Guam. The U.S. Navy supports USCG missions as able. These efforts are primarily focused on the U.S. and COFA state EEZs. USCG ships are responsible for patrolling thousands of miles of both U.S. and COFA EEZs. The distances involved are vast: it is 850 miles from Guam to Palau and over 5,000 miles from Honolulu to American Samoa. In addition to fisheries protection, these cutters are also responsible for counter-narcotics, smuggling, other law enforcement requirements, and search and rescue. The United States must increase its regional naval presence to reassure citizens, partners, and potential partners. Utilizing USCG assets reassures regional allies and partners while minimizing the threat of escalation with the PRC, reducing fears and potential misgivings of U.S. intent. The United States should increase USCG District Oceania’s assets by relocating four Fast Response Cutters currently homeported in Bahrain to the South Pacific. The increased presence of Littoral Combat Ships in U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility would mitigate the reallocation of the four FRCs. Eradicating IUUF Increased and improved provision of command and control and MDA and increased capacity to intercept IUUF fishermen is required for the eradication of IUUF. Officials at the New Zealand embassy stated that there were not sufficient naval forces in the region to enforce EEZs across the multitude of countries. Legal action offers an essential tool to deter further incursions despite limited forces at sea. PICs should be provided legal, domestic, and security assistance to prosecute transnational crime. Most PRC fishing captains work for state owned enterprises tied to important CCP bosses. Linking senior CCP party members to illegal behavior that costs PIC citizens jobs, money, and resources for the future could be a method to end IUUF as well as deter future PRC illegal activities. Convictions in absentia after fair public trials are a method to deter PRC activity and highlight PRC malign influence. Healthcare and Pacific Partnership Medical support is one of the most frequently requested forms of aid from PICs. The U.S. Navy’s Pacific Partnership is hugely popular in the region and provides life-changing care. The popularity of the mission should drive the U.S. and allies to increase the frequency of visits with increased allied support. USNS Mercy does not participate every year, but there has been an attempt at her participation every two years. The Department of Defense should discuss RAN, RNZN, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force support for increasing the number of Pacific Partnership missions. Although none of these navies have a dedicated hospital ship like USNS Mercy, each nation has a ship suitable for these missions and the capacity to send a single vessel for a 3–4-month humanitarian deployment to the South Pacific. A planned rotation of USN, RAN, USN, RNZN, USN, JMSDF provides a six-year cycle that enables maintenance, training, and other operational requirements to be scheduled. The U.S. off-years would still see U.S. mission support with a ship as well as medical personnel. U.S. years would have USNS Mercy support. The Navy should hub a medical expeditionary ship (T-EMS) in Yap, Federated States of Micronesia to support smaller scale but persistent humanitarian medical support in the region. These vessels contain one or two operating rooms and are extremely suitable for this mission because of their shallow draft and hospital level facilities and ability to embark helicopters. The T-EMS’s sister ships, the fast expeditionary transports (T-EPFs) have been frequently used for Pacific Partnership stations, demonstrating the utility of this class for use in the South Pacific. The South Pacific region holds immense strategic value for the United States and its allies. Located at the heart of key U.S. alliances and territories, the region has drawn increasing attention from the PRC, whose maritime gray zone insurgent activities threaten to undermine regional security, economic stability, and political alignment. The PRC’s deepening engagement with PICs, particularly through dual-use infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and coercive economic practices has shifted the balance of influence away from traditional allies like the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The potential for Chinese military assets in Kiribati or the Solomon Islands should be viewed as a severe threat to U.S. territories and Indo-Pacific allies. Coupled with increased PLAN presence and aggressive operations, this trend signals a challenge to U.S. freedom of movement and regional dominance. To effectively counter this encroachment, the U.S. must commit to a comprehensive, multi-pronged strategy that integrates regional security support, humanitarian assistance, and institutional cooperation. Expanding the Pacific Fusion Center will strengthen intelligence sharing and regional coordination and MDA. Increased USCG presence would deter illegal activities like unregulated fishing and support local law enforcement capabilities. These efforts should be pursued in partnership with Australia, New Zealand, and other like-minded nations to promote regional ownership and reduce perceptions of neocolonial influence. Combating transnational crime, particularly illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing requires not only physical presence but also legal and political resolve. Holding senior PRC officials accountable through international legal mechanisms can deter further violations and reinforce the rule of law. In parallel, bolstering regional healthcare through expanded Pacific Partnership missions and sustained medical presence such as stationing a T-EMS in Micronesia will address urgent humanitarian needs and enhance U.S. soft power. Ultimately, securing the South Pacific is not solely about countering PRC influence. It involves empowering Pacific Island Countries, reaffirming the United States’ commitment to its allies, and ensuring that the region remains free, open, and resilient.

Australia is Buying Dozens of Autonomous Subs. What Will They be Used For?,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/australia-is-buying-dozens-of-autonomous-subs-what-will-they-be-used-for,,14/09/2025 23:54:10,,"[By Sam Goldsmith] Autonomous submarines that Australia has launched into production are likely to relieve operational pressure on the country’s crewed submarines, undertake the most dangerous undersea missions, and present an enemy with greater risk of detection and attack. While the government and builder Anduril are saying little about specific technology built into the submarines, called Ghost Sharks, some features are clearly probable or even certain, at least when the design is fully developed. Likely missions include communications and radar intelligence, detecting ships and other submarines, and laying mines. The AUD$1.7 billion, five-year contract announced on September 10 would cover production of a first batch of dozens of Ghost Sharks, with entry into service early in 2026, the government said. The money would also pay for maintaining the submarines in service and for further development of the design. ‘This is the leading capability in the world in terms of a long-range autonomous underwater capability,’ Defence Minister Richard Marles told reporters. Specifications are undisclosed, but the all-electric Ghost Sharks are evidently less than 12 meters long, in at least one configuration, and displace less than 100 tonnes. The six crewed submarines of Australia’s Collins class are 78 meters long and displace 3,100 tonnes. Launch of full-rate production follows a development program in which Anduril, working with the Royal Australian Navy and Defence agencies, built three prototypes ahead of schedule and within budget. ‘Ghost Shark will continue to evolve, as it must, with new payloads, new weapons, smarter autonomy and adapting to the emerging threats,’ said David Goodrich, chief executive of Anduril Asia-Pacific. An obvious role for Ghost Sharks is the traditional submarine function of collecting communications and radar intelligence, in which a boat loiters in a place suitable for receiving signals and sticks an antenna above the water to do so. Submarines are valuable for this role because they can covertly carry their receivers close to a foreign transmitter to pick up weak signals or those made when the presence of a listener is unsuspected. To the extent that Ghost Sharks can relieve the Collins boats of that mission, those crewed submarines, 22 to 29 years old, will be under less operational pressure. The Ghost Sharks, being numerous, should be able to simultaneously undertake such intelligence-collection in many more places than the crewed submarines can. Being so much smaller and not needing to expose a snorkel pipe for running diesel generators (which they don’t have), they should be able to loiter in places where the navy would dare not send a Collins. Anduril has said the Dive-XL autonomous-submarine design, which the Ghost Shark is based on, has a ‘multi-thousand mile range’, meaning at least 3,200 km. The voyage doesn’t have to start from a harbor: a Ghost Shark could be carried partway to its destination on a ship. On the other hand, it’s likely to cruise at only around 3 or 4 knots (6 or 7 km/h) to conserve battery energy. Ghost Sharks will surely carry sonars for detecting sound from other vessels, quite likely including rope-like towed array sonars, which may have to be clipped on by divers as the sub leaves on missions. Ghost Sharks should be able to identify targets from sound signatures and decide whether they should rise to near the surface to make a radio report of what they’ve found. The information might then cue attacks by other forces, such as Boeing P-8A Poseidon maritime aircraft. Again, in performing these missions, Ghost Sharks can to some extent substitute for crewed submarines, and they can do the work in more and riskier places—especially since high danger of destruction of an uncrewed vessel may be acceptable. Maritime choke points, such as straits, are likely locations, but it’s conceivable that a line of Ghost Sharks might assemble off, say, the northwest coast of Australia and listen for enemy submarines in the open ocean. Ghost Sharks must be much too slow to maneuver to make their own torpedo attacks. They can surely lay mines, however, which is presumably the strike capability that Marles said the Ghost Shark would bring. Minelaying is another task that Ghost Sharks could do in more and riskier places than a Collins might enter, possibly even in ports. Whether for minelaying or other tasks, Ghost Sharks could be dispatched before a war broke out, under instructions to lie on the sea bottom and await instructions, which might be sent by various means. Unlike crewed submarines, they couldn’t run out of food. The dozens of Ghost Sharks in the initial batch, plus those that will follow, should enormously expand Australia’s ability to exploit the advantages of undersea warfare—to observe an enemy and disrupt its actions.

U.S. Air Force Tests Out Anti-Ship Bomb Near Russia's Doorstep,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-air-force-tests-out-anti-ship-bomb-on-russia-s-doorstep,,14/09/2025 22:42:57,,"Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force tried out the USAF's new antiship bomb against a maritime target in the Norwegian Sea, achieving the desired effect. Quicksink is designed to follow a ship's movements while in mid-flight, with enough precision that it can drop into the water right alongside. When it sinks to a certain preset depth below the keel, it detonates, forcing the hull to hog upwards with the blast. The ship then falls back down, sags, and (in at least one prior test) breaks in two. In prior testing on a small merchant ship, complete sinking was achieved in under 20 seconds. This is the method of destruction delivered by heavyweight torpedoes, generally considered the gold standard of maritime lethality - but at a small fraction of a torpedo's cost. A Quicksink test in 2022 (Air Force Research Laboratory) “A Navy submarine has the ability to launch and destroy a ship with a single torpedo at any time, but the Quicksink aims to develop a low-cost method of achieving torpedo-like kills from the air at a much higher rate and over a much larger area,” explained AFRL program manager Kirk Herzog in 2022. This month, the U.S. Air Force conducted a new round of testing - this time, far from home. After a week of preparation for the bomb load, a U.S. Air Force B-2 bomber out of Whiteman AFB, Missouri flew all the way to the Norwegian Sea, where it met up with four F-35 fighters of the Royal Norwegian Air Force and one P-8A Poseidon maritime search aircraft. Escorted by the Norwegian fighters, the B-2 crew dropped more than one bomb on an unspecified maritime target, sinking it. Courtesy RNoAF Courtesy USAF “This test is a clear example of how we work with trusted allies to bring new capabilities into play faster and smarter,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Scott Gunn, 53rd Wing commander. “We’re not just preparing for tomorrow; we’re shaping it together.” The test comes amidst rising tensions between Russia and NATO, including suspicions about the movements of Russia's fishing, research and tanker vessels. In the Baltic, Russia-linked tankers have been accused of attempted or actual damage of subsea cables. Across Northern Europe, defense planners are concerned at the amount of time that Russian research ships have spent near critical subsea infrastructure. And Russia's fishing fleet is universally suspected of spying on NATO interests, so much so that Norway has sharply restricted their access (and will even seize them if they stay too long). In the event of conflict, an inexpensive, proven weapon like Quicksink would be a cost-effective way to resolve these small-vessel threats if they posed a threat to strategic subsea pipelines - critical for delivering Norwegian gas to Europe. A new, 500-pound version of the bomb would be sized and priced appropriately for small vessel threats. Paired with a stealth delivery vehicle like the B-2, it would also be an efficient deterrent to bottle up the surface combatants of Russia's Northern Fleet in the Barents Sea, away from the likely conflict zone of the North Atlantic.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 04:42:55
India Pledges to Support Mauritius in Surveillance of Chagos Islands,https://maritime-executive.com/article/india-pledges-to-support-mauritius-in-surveillance-of-chagos-islands,,14/09/2025 21:38:22,,"As the UK plans to hand over Chagos Islands to Mauritius, India is eyeing to exert its influence on the archipelago. Last week, Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam made a state visit to India, where together with Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed on several bilateral pacts spanning power sector, port development and maritime security. A major highlight of the discussion between the two leaders is India offering to assist Mauritius as it moves to assert its sovereignty over Chagos Islands. Modi congratulated his Mauritian counterpart on the return of Chagos Islands, terming the measure as a historic milestone. “India has always supported decolonization and stood firmly with Mauritius in this journey,” added Modi. However, the Chagos Islands takeover means Mauritius will have an expanded maritime zone to monitor. Currently, the size of Mauritius EEZ is estimated at 2.3 million square kilometers for a country with a modest coast guard, operating less than a dozen patrol vessels. Commenting on the new obligations for Mauritius, India’s Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said that India remains ready to provide the needed assistance. “Mauritius has many more responsibilities now. It needs maritime resources, and in order to be able to fully develop and exploit those resources, it will need assistance. India is a preferred partner in providing that assistance. In addition, maritime security cooperation would help counter illegal fishing, arms and drug trafficking through support with equipment, platforms and trained personnel,” noted Misri. Part of this support also includes surveillance of Chagos Marine Protected Area (MPA). The U.K government designated the MPA back in 2010, and it remains one of the world’s largest MPAs at a size of 640,000 square kilometers. Notably, Mauritian PM Ramgoolan requested Modi to provide an Indian ship for a planned mission to the Chagos Islands. “We want to visit Chagos to put our flag there. The British offered us a vessel, but we said we preferred one from India because symbolically it would be better,” said Ramgoolan. Early this year, when Modi visited Mauritius, the two countries upgraded their ties to an enhanced strategic partnership. This has seen Mauritius become one of the largest recipients of Indian aid, with deals worth $680 million signed last week. Part of this funding will go into the upgrade of Mauritius’ Port Louis. With the re-routing of global merchant shipping via the Cape of Good Hope, Port Louis has strategic significance on the busy east-west shipping routes. Mauritius is also important to India’s ambition of projecting naval influence in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the British House of Commons last week voted in favor of a bill supporting handover of Chagos archipelago to Mauritius. A delegation from the UK’s Foreign Office is expected in Mauritius later this month to finalize the handover process. However, Chagos’s largest island, Diego Garcia, remains under the Anglo- American military lease for 99 years.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 04:42:55
Cutting the Cost of Killing Drones at Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cutting-the-cost-of-killing-drones-at-sea,,14/09/2025 20:04:35,,"[From our correspondent at DSEI] Shooting down Houthi drones in the Red Sea has been an expensive business. Royal Navy Type 45 guided missile destroyer HMS Diamond (D34) was deployed in zone in the Red Sea for several months in early 2024, and on one night in January shot down seven drones aimed at merchant vessels, using its Sea Viper missiles. On its last night in the danger area, it shot down a Houthi ballistic missile. US Navy vessels, and other allies participating in Operation Prosperity Guardian, accounted for many more drones and missiles. Whilst some drones were brought down by relatively inexpensively machine and chain gun fire from Phalanx and similar such systems, most takedowns were performed using missiles. A single Sea Viper missile probably costs more than $1m. The total cost of missiles fired by HMS Diamond during its Red Sea deployment has been estimated to be $25m, whereas the cost per unit of the Houthi drones shot down is probably in the region of $50,000. The imbalance in the cost of attacking with drones, as opposed to defending against drones, makes the contest more than just a test of rival technologies. It also becomes a matter of attrition and economics, with defenders using systems designed for far more sophisticated targets running down stocks that are necessarily limited because of the cost of procurement. The disparity has been clearly demonstrated once again by the recent air incursion into Poland on September 10 by at least 17 Russian drones. At least 15 were Gerbera decoy drones, unsophisticated dummies designed to draw fire, making the Russian effort either a test run or a political stunt. But this did not prevent an expensive array of air-to-air missiles being expended by NATO jets to bring them down. Economically, the contest was won by the Russians. In open war, a similar such attack would reduce NATO stocks of air defense missiles before the Russians deployed the real drones with explosive payloads. Hence one of the most interesting stands at the biennial Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition held in London this week was that of Frankenburg Technologies. This Estonian firm has developed a short-range, speed-of-sound anti-drone missile for a unit cost of about $65,000. The company describe the missile as the smallest guided missile in the world. The Frankenburg Mk 1 can be fired from ships, but also from aircraft, drones, from fixed ground sites and armored vehicles. The low cost of the system effectively means that it could be deployed on many more platforms than is currently the case in naval applications, where the target demands a more sophisticated and integrated defensive approach. Frankenburg Technologies contends that the simplicity of its design will enable hundreds of missiles to be manufactured every week. The system appears to undergoing field trials in Ukraine. Commander Dan Hallett, a director of the firm and a former Royal Navy officer, told TME ""I’ve seen how fast maritime threats evolve. Today, Russian drones strike Ukrainian ports and Houthi drones target Red Sea shipping — proof that drones are now weapons of strategic disruption at sea. Frankenburg Technologies pairs frontline experience with advanced counter-drone missile systems for crewed and uncrewed vessels, giving navies, ports, and energy operators the tools to detect and defeat these threats before they endanger lives and maritime trade.” It remains to be seen if prolonged Western procurement processes can transition from peacetime to more agile contracting in the face of an intensified and accelerating threat. Faced with the realities of a national struggle for survival, the Ukrainian government has an imperative to make that transition. But whether other governments still in peacetime mode can follow that lead remains to be seen.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 04:42:55
ICJ Climate Ruling May Help Fight Against Shell's S. Africa Drilling Plans,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/icj-climate-ruling-may-help-fight-against-shell-s-s-africa-drilling-plans,,14/09/2025 19:44:15,,"[By Angela van der Berg] The International Court of Justice’s landmark advisory opinion on climate change has come in handy for South African communities that are trying to stop global oil company Shell from drilling for oil and gas off the coast. The opinion, handed down by the world’s highest court in July 2025, sets out what all governments are legally required to do to tackle climate change. It confirmed that: The advisory opinion is already being used in South Africa by a community and environmental law organization, Natural Justice, and a sustainable development advocacy group, The Green Connection, in their appeal against a government decision to allow Shell to drill up to five exploration and appraisal wells off the coast of the Northern Cape province. Their appeal says the South African government has not considered how Shell’s oil exploration will contribute to climate change. I am an environmental law specialist who researches how international and domestic law can be used to advance climate justice in South Africa and across Africa. In my view, the advisory opinion could shift the balance in courtrooms across Africa in favor of environmental justice and human rights groups. It confirms that governments must align fossil fuel decisions with their duty to prevent harm. This gives communities a stronger legal basis to argue that fossil fuel expansion undermines both their rights and their country’s climate obligations. South Africa is already experiencing worsening floods, droughts and storms. Every bit of warming increases these risks. The country’s 2024 Climate Change Act sets out a pathway to cut emissions and build resilience. Yet fossil fuel projects are still being approved by the government. What the Shell appeal is all about In June 2025, South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources granted Shell an environmental authorization to drill for oil and gas in the ocean on the country’s west coast. This area is ecologically sensitive, supporting whales, fish stocks and small-scale fishing communities. Natural Justice and The Green Connection argue in their appeal that the authorization is unlawful and defective. They give the following reasons. The environmental impact assessment assumed an oil spill could be stopped far more quickly than is realistic, and downplayed the risks of ultra-deepwater drilling, where equipment failure or a blowout on the scale of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster is possible. These risks threaten marine ecosystems and small-scale fishers’ livelihoods. Some of Shell’s safety and emergency response plans were not included in the assessment. This meant the public and decision-makers could not evaluate whether Shell is able to manage a major disaster. Their absence doesn’t mean Shell has no plans at all, but it does mean the decision was taken without a transparent review of those plans. No baseline studies (basic surveys of the marine life and ecosystems in the exact area) were done before approval. Without this information, the risks from spills, and pollution to whales, fish and corals, were likely underestimated. The appeal also says that there was no consideration about how future production might affect South Africa’s ability to meet its Paris Agreement commitments, and that drilling for oil and gas is outdated as these are not renewable energies. Any oil spills could pollute beyond South African borders, potentially reaching neighboring Namibian waters. However, the environmental impact assessment ignored effects on Namibian fisheries, tourism and coastal communities. Finally, the approval failed to comply with the Integrated Coastal Management Act, which says the South African government must protect sensitive ecosystems for the long-term benefit of communities and future generations. How the International Court of Justice opinion has been used in the appeal The advisory opinion is not legally binding. However, the obligations it has confirmed, in international climate and customary law, are. It is the most authoritative interpretation yet of what governments must do to prevent further climate change. Under South Africa’s constitution, courts must take international law into account when interpreting rights. This gives organizations like Natural Justice and The Green Connection (and others across Africa) a powerful new tool. They can: A turning point Across Africa, where 45 countries are exploring for oil, gas or coal, the court’s opinion raises the stakes by suggesting that continued fossil fuel expansion could breach international obligations. The Shell appeal is a test for whether South African courts will accept that fossil fuel expansion in the era of the climate crisis is inconsistent with the constitution and international law. Win or lose, the case marks a shift. For the first time, African activists are wielding the United Nations’ highest court as part of their legal strategy. As climate impacts intensify, that strategy may prove decisive in shaping Africa’s energy future.

Manila views the declaration as a pretext, designed to extend Chinese sovereignty over Philippine territory, and a new excuse to allow the China Coast Guard to refuse access for Philippine artisanal fishermen. The news may be especially concerning for the Philippines given a reported buildup of up-armed Chinese patrol boats around Scarborough in recent weeks. On Sept. 10, China's State Council declared a new ""National Nature Reserve"" covering waters in and around Scarborough Shoal. While a compelling policy choice in its own right, China's ability to declare any special maritime zone in the area is in question. The Chinese mainland is more than 450 nautical miles away from Scarborough Shoal, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague rejected China's claim to waters within the Philippine EEZ nine years ago. Among many other findings, the court specifically ruled against China's attempts to close off access to Scarborough Shoal for Philippine fishermen. China has ignored the ruling and maintains that it has sovereign ownership over most of the South China Sea, citing the history of Chinese commerce in the area and a much-contested interpretation of UNCLOS' ""straight baseline"" clause. ""The irony is clear: since 2016, evidence has shown large-scale harvesting of endangered species and reef destruction by Chinese fishermen,"" Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement. ""To now claim stewardship over an ecosystem that they themselves has damaged is both contradictory and misleading."" Beijing's ""nature reserve"" plans drew immediate opposition from the Philippine government. On Friday, Manila filed a diplomatic protest - the latest of many - to voice its objections to new infringements on Philippine sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio joined the Philippines' objections, calling the Chinese declaration ""another coercive attempt to advance sweeping territorial and maritime claims.""

Busy Days in the Strait of Taiwan,https://maritime-executive.com/article/busy-days-in-the-strait-of-taiwan,,15/09/2025 02:03:05,,"In recent days, the Taiwan Straits has been busy with allied warships. Hobart Class destroyer HMAS Brisbane (DDG-41) and Halifax Class frigate HMCS Ville de Québec (FFH-332) transited the Straits on September 6. A People’s Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command spokesman objected to the transit in the normal manner, and said that the naval movements had been monitored. While the transit was occurring, the Royal Navy carrier HMS Prince of Wales (R09), having completed a five-day port visit to Tokyo, sailed northwards along Japan’s eastern seaboard with HMS Dauntless (D33) and into the Sea of Japan, then southwards to commence a series of exercises with South Korean Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin Class destroyer ROKS Gang Gam-chan (DDH-979), minelayer ROKS Nampo (MLS-570) and Soyang Class fast combat support ship ROKS Soyang (AOE-51). As this activity was winding up in the Sea of Japan on September 8, two ships from Russia’s Pacific Fleet based in Vladivostok, the flagship Slava Class cruiser RFS Varyag (D001 and the Steregushchiy Class corvette RFS Gromkiy (F335) were heading in the opposite direction, leaving the area through the Soya Strait off northern Hokkaido, and then cruising through the Sea of Okhotsk into the northern Pacific. The Australian and Canadian innocent passage was followed up by Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Higgins (DDG-76) and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond (F239) also transiting the Taiwan Straits on September 12. There had been some speculation in the British press that Foreign Minister David Lammy, to avoid upsetting the Chinese, had vetoed the passage of HMS Richmond, to the consternation of the Ministry of Defence - but Lammy was replaced as foreign minister a week before the transit took place. The carrier strike group led by HMS Prince of Wales is now on its long return journey to Portsmouth. On its outward deployment, the CSG passed through the Middle East region during a short-lived lull. On its return, the CSG is likely to have to contend with a more complex security situation. But the CSG commander can feel reassured that his command is operationally at peak efficiency, after continuous training at sea with allies since it left Portsmouth in April.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 15:42:25
NATO Responds to Russian Fishing Vessel Adrift in Danish Straits,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nato-responds-to-russian-fishing-vessel-adrift-in-danish-straits,,15/09/2025 01:53:20,,"A brand new Russian fishing vessel broke down near the strategic southern entrance of the Oresund over the weekend, drifting in the sea lanes and attracting the attention of NATO member security forces. The crab vessel Mechanic Stepanov was built at Otradnoye Shipyard on the Neva River, and it received its RS class certification on September 4. No problems were identified in inspections and sea trials, and the vessel was cleared to depart for the long voyage to its home port in the Kuril Islands. The Stepanov got under way from St. Petersburg last Wednesday, but did not make it very far before running into trouble. The crab boat transited westbound through the Baltic and then suffered a blackout on Saturday night, reportedly due to a mechanical casualty. AIS data shows that the Stepanov was adrift in a busy shipping lane at the entrance to the Oresund for an extended period before going to anchor. Given heightened tensions between Russia and NATO - and previous incidents in the Baltic and the Danish Straits - a security response from NATO members was inevitable. Photos captured by observer Christian Panton show the Latvian Navy minesweeper LNVS Virsaitis (A53) responding to the scene, along with the Danish patrol boat Bopa (MHV 911). Swedish outlet Aftonbladet received an unconfirmed report that the crew of the fishing vessel requested a port of refuge in Sweden and were turned down, though this narrative was disputed by the authorities. After regaining power, Mechanic Stepanov transited north with a security escort and returned to its commercial voyage.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 15:42:25

"China’s ""Man in Peru"" At Center of Chancay Megaport",https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/china-s-man-in-peru-at-center-of-chancay-megaport,,15/09/2025 17:15:36,,"A Florida Republican is warning the State Department about what he describes as China’s “growing influence” in Peru, and he’s pointing the finger at Lima Mayor Rafael López Aliaga, whose business interests are at the center of the story. Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio urging the Trump administration to pay closer attention to developments in Peru, where Chinese-backed ventures have accelerated in recent years. “I am writing to raise urgent concerns about China’s growing influence in and around Lima, the capital of Peru, as part of the Chinese Communist Party’s deliberate, wide-ranging campaign to expand its global reach,” Steube wrote. At the center of the congressman’s concerns is the Chancay megaport, $3.4 billion facility developed by the Chinese state-owned shipping and logistics company COSCO Shipping Ports in association with the Peruvian company Volcan. The port — expected to be one of the largest in South America and reducing shipping times to China by 10 to 20 days —was inaugurated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Peruvian President Dina Boluarte in November. It’s also part of a plan announced by China and Brazil to construct more than 1,800 miles of railway tracks through parts of the Amazon rainforest to create the Bioceanic Corridor across the continent. Chancay would be connected by rail to Cusco, a key rail hub of PeruRail. Since 1999, Lopez Aliaga has been a co-shareholder of PeruRail. All of this development is part of the CCP’s strategic Belt and Road Initiative to create political leverage for the Chinese regime. Former U.S. Southern Command chief Gen. Laura Richardson has previously warned that the port could serve as a “gateway” for Chinese military and intelligence operations in the region. “Mayor López Aliaga, a man with clear ties to Chinese state-backed enterprises, may soon seek the presidency of a nation whose capital, infrastructure, and minerals are already tethered to Beijing,” Steube wrote. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, recently published a report laying out López Aliaga’s financial entanglements with Chinese firms, describing him as “China’s man in Peru.” Concerns about Aliaga and PeruRail have risen so high in the Trump administration that there are unconfirmed reports the U.S. Department of Energy rejected a proposed loan to the Peruvian rail company. The U.S. Department of Energy declined to respond to multiple requests for comment about the loan. Analysts note that China’s interest in Peru is closely tied to copper. Peru is the world’s second-largest producer of the mineral, which is vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and electronics manufacturing. China already controls significant copper supplies from Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Between 2020 and 2023, Chinese firms invested more than $1 billion in Peru’s mining sector, according to FDD. One of the country’s largest mines, Minera Las Bambas, is majority-owned by a Chinese state conglomerate. Steube argued that Washington has been too slow to counter Beijing’s moves in Latin America. “The United States cannot afford to ignore these subnational battlegrounds,” he wrote. “While Washington debates great-power competition in abstract terms, Beijing is executing a concrete playbook in Lima.” He urged the State Department to monitor Chinese engagement at both the national and local levels in Peru, warning that Beijing’s influence could reshape the balance of power in the hemisphere. The State Department has not yet issued a public comment in response to Steube’s letter. Jessica Towhey writes on education and energy policy for InsideSources.

Ingalls Subcontracts Out Destroyer Blocks to Eastern Shipbuilding,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ingalls-subcontracts-out-destroyer-blocks-to-eastern-shipbuilding,,15/09/2025 16:32:14,,"Eastern Shipbuilding Group has reached a deal with Huntington Ingalls Industries to build blocks for the Ingalls yard's flagship product, the Navy's Flight III Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. The Flight III is the new backbone of the U.S. Navy's overseas presence, capable of escorting a carrier strike group, shooting down ballistic missiles or operating independently on blue water missions. HII's high-spec warship programs are behind schedule, in part due to a workforce shortage, and the Navy is pushing hard to speed up production. One way to do it is to distribute some of the work of blockbuilding to subcontractors, as demonstrated by the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth-class carrier program, which relied on blocks built at subcontractor yards around Britain. HII is experimenting with similar trials with yards like Eastern, which has built a limited number of blocks for the DDG program under an HII pilot program. HII and ESG have now formalized the agreement. “With nearly fifty years of experience delivering some of the most reliable and highest-performing steel and aluminum vessels, we’re proud to partner with HII to support production of the U.S. Navy’s destroyer fleet,” said Joey D’Isernia, CEO of Eastern Shipbuilding Group, Inc. “This collaboration strengthens our national shipbuilding capability—expanding industrial capacity and enhancing our nation’s competitive advantage.” According to USNI, HII is initially focusing its outsourcing efforts on simpler modules, saving the complex hull shapes with more sophisticated contents for its own shipbuilders to build. The grand blocks built by ESG are sealed in plastic (like a superyacht in transit), loaded out on a deck barge, then shipped west to the Ingalls yard in Mississippi. ESG says that it is continuing to invest in its government-focused yard location to support more defense work, enabling it to ""construct and deliver multiple ships per year."" HII's workload-distribution efforts extend beyond the Gulf Coast. It has multiple new subcontractors working for its Newport News Shipyard to build assemblies for carriers and subs (including Austal, which is constructing modules for Virginia-class attack subs). It has also bought its own new fabrication facility in South Carolina, drawing in a new workforce for HII without requiring the workers to relocate. ""This evolution to a more distributed shipbuilding model will expand production of the next generation [of warships]"" HII said in a statement last week.",Maritime Executive,15/09/2025 21:29:43
School Children Injured as Historic Sailing Ship and Dredger Collide,https://maritime-executive.com/article/school-children-injured-as-historic-sailing-ship-and-dredger-collide,,15/09/2025 16:31:28,,"The Dutch rescue service is reporting minor injuries among a group of school children who were on a class trip aboard a historic sailing ship. The vessel Storebaelt, which operates charter trips, was off the Netherlands coast on Sunday evening, September 14, when it and a dredger collided. According to KNRM, the sailing vessel had 25 school-age children aboard along with five adults. They received a report of the collision at 2030 local time, and two rescue boats reached the vessels in 10 minutes. Five of the children were removed from the sailing ship and transferred to the shore of one of the rescue boats. Waiting ambulances and volunteers attended to the children. “A few were shocked, and some have bumps on their heads,” a Coast Guard spokesperson said on Dutch broadcaster NOS. The remaining children remained aboard the 65-meter (213-foot) sailing vessel while it was towed to shore. They were transferred to a local hotel at 0100 on Monday morning. The Coast Guard noted that there was bad weather, rain, and strong winds in the area, which could have been factors in the collision. It was also dark when the collision occurred.

According to the operator’s online profile, during World War II, the vessel transported goods and troops for the Allies and participated in Operation Neptune on D-Day in 1944. It was renovated in 1994 into a luxurious sailing ship with 13 cabins, and overnight it has accommodations for 32 people or 50 people on day trips. The vessel was involved in a head-on collision with the dredger Prins 3, which is registered in Panama. The bow spirit of the sailing ship was broken off, and the bow and side showed damage. The dredger also sustained dents and scrapes, but none of the three crew aboard were injured. The dredger returned to Harlingen under its own power.

Bulgarian Police Arrest Owner of Beirut's Notorious Explosives Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulgarian-police-arrest-charterer-of-beirut-s-notorious-explosives-ship,,16/09/2025 02:28:00,,"Officials in Bulgaria have arrested the owner of the Rhosus, the aging freighter that brought a cargo of explosives-grade ammonium nitrate into Beirut in 2013. In 2020, that cargo exploded, destroying half the port and killing more than 200 people. The cargo of ammonium nitrate entered Beirut’s port on the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus in November 2013. The vessel was detained for PSC deficiencies and seized by port officials. Her cargo was a consignment of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, officially intended for a mining firm in Mozambique, but mechanical issues forced the ship to call in Beirut (or to pick up more paying cargo, depending on the account). Rhosus never left: it was detained for PSC deficiencies, then abandoned by the owner, and it later sank at a pier. The cargo was moved to a warehouse on the grain pier, where it stayed until its detonation on August 4, 2020. After the blast, the FBI estimated that the actual amount that detonated was about one-fifth of that, indicating that a portion of the cargo had been surreptitiously removed. The site had known security gaps: welders were working to secure the doors of the warehouse facility on the day of the blast, and likely triggered the explosion. Attention quickly focused on the Rhosus' role in the tragedy, and on the owners who abandoned it. Shortly after the investigation into the blast got under way, the investigating judge on the case (at the time) issued an international arrest warrant for the captain and for the owner, Russian-Cypriot dual national Igor Grechushkin. His role in the vessel's operation is disputed: the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has identified another Cypriot shipping magnate as the vessel's ultimate beneficial owner, and based on OCCRP's paper trail, Grechuschkin appears to have been chartering the vessel. Grechushkin has been subject to an arrest warrant for many years, but with little effect. This may be in part because of the status of the Lebanese investigation. After the blast, the inquiry almost immediately focused in on the Lebanese political figures who allowed the explosives to sit on a dock near a residential district. The suspects began to fight back: certain officials worked to have the investigating judge removed, and the inquiry under replacement Judge Tarek Bitar also stalled. The case became an oft-cited and unpopular example of self-dealing by powerful members of Lebanon's political class. After years of stagnation, the investigation got a reboot in January 2025 thanks to the newly-elected government of Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam. They campaigned on a pledge to seek justice for the thousands of people who were displaced, injured or killed by the blast, and immediately empowered Bitar to move forward. That inquiry is showing signs of progress at last, and Grechuschkin's arrest is among the first tangible steps.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35
AI Tool Launched to Detect Misdeclared and Dangerous Goods in Containers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ai-tool-launched-to-detect-misdeclared-and-dangerous-goods-in-containers,,16/09/2025 02:11:00,,"The latest tool in the fight against misdeclared and undeclared dangerous goods in containers is being launched by the World Shipping Council in its Cargo Safety Program. The industry-led initiative is using a new AI-powered screening tool in an attempt to identify the dangers that are a leading cause of fires and increase protection for crew, vessels, and the environment. At launch, carriers representing more than 70 percent of global TEU capacity have joined the program. Misdeclared dangerous goods are a leading cause of ship fires, reported as responsible for more than a quarter of all cargo-related incidents, according to data from Allianz's Safety and Shipping Review 2025. The insurer warned in its analysis that ship fires are at their highest level in over a decade, including several high-profile incidents in recent weeks. The Marie Maersk reached Malaysia yesterday, September 14, a month after the crew saw smoke coming from a container while they were off the coast of Africa. While they were able to contain the fire, Maersk has declared General Average to share the cost of the extraordinary firefighting effort. Last week, the hulk of Wan Hai 503 also finally arrived in a port of refuge after a devastating container fire and explosions, which contributed to the loss of four crewmembers and a vessel that was largely burnt out. “We have seen too many tragic incidents where misdeclared cargo has led to catastrophic fires, including the loss of life,” said Joe Kramek, President and CEO of the World Shipping Council. “The WSC Cargo Safety Program strengthens the industry’s safety net by combining shared screening technology, common inspection standards, and real-world feedback to reduce risk.” At the heart of the program is a digital cargo screening tool powered by the National Cargo Bureau’s (NCB) technology. The program combines AI-powered cargo screening and common inspection standards to identify misdeclared and undeclared high-risk shipments before they are loaded. In addition, it incorporates machine learning to help the tool get smarter and to adapt to new and emerging risks. The system will scan millions of bookings in real time using keyword searches, trade pattern recognition, and AI-driven algorithms to identify potential risks. Alerts are reviewed by carriers and, when needed, verified through targeted physical inspections. The World Shipping Council says it does not replace the fundamental obligation shippers have to declare dangerous goods accurately. However, the program will also establish common inspection standards for verifying shipments and an incident feedback loop to ensure lessons from real-world cases strengthen prevention. The World Shipping Council recently warned that an analysis of port state inspection data showed that more than one-in-ten (11.39 percent) had a problem in 2024 out of more than 77,600 containers inspected. The report highlighted that deficiencies were up slightly from 2023 and at a new, recent high, with issues including misdeclared and undeclared dangerous goods, incorrect documentation, and improper packing. By improving cargo screening, the World Shipping Council believes it will help prevent incidents, protecting crew, vessels, other cargo, and the environment. A similar effort launched in the past few years to help educate crews about container collapses and the dangers of parametric rolling contributed to declines in the number of boxes being lost overboard.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35

The Unified Command overseeing the operations reported as of Sunday, September 14, that nearly half of the containers estimated to have fallen from the vessel have been recovered, while they have also secured containers remaining aboard the containership Mississippi. The Southern California US Coast Guard reported on Sunday that eight more submerged containers had been located and that they were being removed. In total, it said 32 containers had been recovered as of Sunday out of the estimated 75 boxes that fell from the Mississippi on September 9. The first two containers were recovered on Wednesday, the day after the incident, while the Coast Guard said sonar surveys were underway to locate the submerged containers. The Unified Command reports it is continuing to conduct surveys, drone overflights, and dive operations. Two bays on the Mississippi collapsed on Tuesday, leaving numerous boxes askew. Some later fell onto the dock. Now, the port and the Unified Command are reporting unaffected containers have been secured. A small fuel leak from the emissions barge was also secured last week. “In just a few days, we have made significant progress in securing the vessel cargo and recovering containers,” said Capt. Stacey Crecy, Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles – Long Beach. “This progress was made possible due to the dedication of all participating agencies, vessel managers, the Port of Long Beach, the ITS terminal, and highly skilled ILWU labor working together.” Cargo operations are largely unaffected, they report, except at the single berth. A 500-yard safety zone remains in place, and the USCG is helping to navigate vessels around the zone to continue port operations. The incident comes as the port continues to see strong volumes. The Port of Long Beach reported today that it had its second-busiest August on record and the sixth-busiest month in its 114-year history. Container volume was 901,846 TEU, which was down approximately 4.5 percent from July but only 1.3 percent down from the record set a year ago in August. Imports were down 3.6 percent and exports off more than 8 percent, while empties leaving the port were up 3.7 percent. The Port of Long Beach notes its volume is up 8.3 percent so far in 2025 to nearly 6.6 million TEU. The Port of Long Beach notes that retailers have continued to rush merchandise imports during the pause in tariffs. Recently, the National Retail Federation, however, predicted that container imports would continue month-to-month declines before leveling off at a reduced rate.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35
20-Foot Standard Containers: Why They Remain a Popular Choice,https://maritime-executive.com/features/20-foot-standard-containers-why-they-remain-a-popular-choice-2,,16/09/2025 00:14:32,,"When it comes to storage and transportation needs, 20 ft standard containers continue to stand the test of time. These containers have been a staple in the shipping and logistics industry for decades. Their compact size, robust durability, and incredible versatility make them a go-to solution for businesses and individuals alike. Whether you’re moving cargo across the globe or seeking a reliable storage option, 20 ft standard containers deliver consistent performance without compromise. Here’s a closer look at why these containers remain a popular choice for storage and transport. What Are 20 ft Standard Containers? A 20 ft standard container is a universally recognized shipping and storage unit crafted to meet strict ISO (International Organization for Standardization) guidelines. Measuring 20 feet in length, 8 feet in width, and 8.5 feet in height, these containers are compact yet spacious enough to accommodate a variety of cargo types. Made from high-strength Corten steel, they are built to endure harsh environmental conditions while safeguarding the contents inside. They are also highly compatible with intermodal transportation, allowing them to transition effortlessly between ships, trucks, and trains. Key Characteristics Dimensions (approximate): Features of 20 ft Standard Containers What sets 20 ft standard containers apart is their well-rounded design that combines practicality, durability, and versatility. Here are some of the key features that make them indispensable: For businesses dealing with large inventories, these containers can be stacked securely, optimizing space usage at ports, warehouses, or job sites. Benefits of 20 ft Standard Containers The enduring popularity of these containers stems from the wide array of benefits they bring to the table: Whether you’re using them for international shipping or as stationary storage units, the 20 ft container is highly portable and fits well in diverse environments, from crowded city spaces to remote industrial sites.

UK Government and Industry Pledge Over $1.4B to Shipping Decarbonization,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-government-and-industry-pledge-over-1-4b-to-shipping-decarbonization,,15/09/2025 23:34:04,,"Timed to the opening of the London International Shipping Week 2025, the UK government announced plans for another massive investment into the decarbonization of shipping that will also include further commitments from the private sector. The government is adding approximately $610 million to its UK Shipping Office for Reducing Emissions (UK Shore) program, while reporting that private industry will contribute another $952 million to programs to aid shore communities and spur decarbonization. UK Shore was launched in 2022 and has already allocated $326 million to more than 200 projects. It has further leveraged an additional approximately $150 million direct private investment. They point to efforts developing electric and efficiency solutions for various vessel types, ranging from ferries to cargo and offshore wind vessels. It has also contributed to programs for hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol, and supports R&D and demonstrations of emerging technologies. The conference kicked off with an opening ceremony at the London Stock Exchange with the UK Parliamentary Under Secretary for Local Transport, Simon Lightwood. He highlighted the critical role shipping plays in the UK economy and its contribution to technological progress. A member of Parliament and the UK government’s recently appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Keir Mather, wrote to Parliament informing them of the investment plan. He highlighted how it fits within the 2025 Department of Transport maritime decarbonization strategy and the goals to place the UK at the forefront. He said they intend the new funding for between 2026 and 2030 to accelerate technology for decarbonization and allow industry to plan for the next five years of clean maritime innovation. During 2026, he said the government plans for the next round of the Zero Emissions Vessels and Infrastructure competition that funds efforts to build and conduct commercial trials of clean maritime solutions. They are also planning the seventh round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition for demonstration projects by 2030. The new funding will also provide for two more rounds between 2027 and 2029 and fund the Clean Maritime Research Hub until at least 2028. Mather traveled to the Cammell Laird yard near Liverpool to highlight $4.9 million of previous UK Shore funding for the installation of a zero-emission electric shore power system. The UK programs have also contributed to power across the South Coast of England and London, as well as the FastRig wingsail being developed in Scotland. Among the private industry investments being announced is more than $400 million from Peel Ports for its Liverpool, Hunterston, and Great Yarmouth ports, while NatPower Marine reported $340 million for shore power. The Port of Tyne will invest more than $200 million in the North Side, creating opportunities in offshore wind and manufacturing. London International Shipping Week continues all week and is designed to highlight advancements in the industry. The Transport Secretary and Maritime Minister will attend a series of events where they will champion UK shipping and highlight the potential for the industry.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35

Steerprop Delivers Mechanical Azimuth Propulsors For Polar Research Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/steerprop-delivers-mechanical-azimuth-propulsors-for-polar-research-vessel,,15/09/2025 21:58:50,,"[By: Steerprop] Finnish propulsion expert Steerprop has been selected to power the new Polarstern, Germany’s next-generation polar research icebreaker, with a propulsion system designed to deliver exceptional reliability, minimal underwater noise, and long-term cost efficiency. The tailor-made solution supports the vessel’s demanding scientific mission in fragile polar environments and ensures high performance through cutting-edge predictive maintenance and proven ice-class technology—now scaled for unprecedented capability. TKMS will build the new Polarstern for the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and has selected the Finnish propulsion specialist Steerprop to supply the azimuth propulsion system for the new Polarstern, Germany’s next-generation polar research icebreaker. Steerprop’s solution was chosen for its exceptional reliability, ultra-low underwater radiated noise (URN), and advanced predictive maintenance capabilities—all vital to the success of long-term, uninterrupted polar missions in fragile ecosystems. In addition to these technical features, Steerprop’s unmatched propulsion expertise and proven ability to support complex, demanding vessel designs made it the clear choice. Steerprop’s polar track record—with azimuth propulsors on every third icebreaker in service in the world and without a single major overhaul in more than 15 years, also gave TKMS and AWI the confidence they needed. Due to enter service in 2030, the new Polarstern will operate for up to 310 days a year in the Arctic and Antarctic, requiring a propulsion solution that supports extreme endurance, energy efficiency, and acoustic sensitivity. Built to Ice Class PC2, the vessel will be powered by two Steerprop SP 160 PULL ARC LM azimuth propulsors, the largest mechanical units of their kind ever built, each delivering 9 MW of power through a 4.8-meter diameter propeller. The specifications require holding a steady 3 knots through multiyear ice of up to 1.8 metres thick with 20 % snow cover. “For a vessel of this importance, technical performance alone isn’t enough,” said Riku-Pekka Hägg, CEO, Steerprop. “We’re proud to deliver a propulsion solution that ensures mission success while minimizing environmental impact, maximizing uptime, and optimizing total cost of ownership over the vessels’s lifetime.” Proven technology, scaled for new demands While the SP 160 PULL ARC LM units represent a record in size, they are based on Steerprop’s well-proven mechanical propulsor platform, used widely in the icebreaking fleet. The thrusters are engineered for harsh ice conditions, offering mechanical dependability with modern automation for precise control in both icebreaking and station-keeping operations. “The new Polarstern represents the next generation of research vessels with its high sustainable profile, and highest safety and standards,” said Yngvar Frodell, Project Director of the new Polarstern at TKMS. “With the selection of the complex propulsion system for the new Polarstern, we are ensuring that we meet our high requirements for reliability and environmental protection.” Steerprop propulsors meet industry’s toughest URN standards The new Polarstern will operate in ecologically sensitive regions where acoustic disturbance must be minimized. Meeting the most stringent URN requirements ever applied to a vessel of this class, the propulsors incorporate Steerprop’s unique design, engineering, and manufacturing standards—including a noise-optimized gearbox design and an integrated permanent magnet propulsion motor. These integrated features reduce radiated noise at its source, making the system ideal for acoustic research and minimally invasive marine operations. Predictive maintenance for maximum uptime and cost efficiency Given the vessel’s limited time in port and expected 30-year service life, predictive maintenance and reliability are central to mission success. Steerprop will supply its full Steerprop Care condition monitoring system, which continuously provides detailed data on propulsor health and performance. This empowers the operator to plan maintenance proactively, eliminating unnecessary part replacements and avoiding unplanned downtime—significantly reducing lifecycle costs. “Instead of changing components on a fixed schedule, the crew can make informed, data-driven decisions about when and what to service. That’s a smarter way to operate—and a big cost saver over decades,” added Hägg. A comprehensive polar propulsion partnership Steerprop’s involvement goes beyond delivering the two main azimuth units. The company is also fully responsible for the hydrodynamic design of the vessel’s center shaft line propeller—ensuring optimal integration and performance across the entire main propulsion system. By taking full ownership of how the vessel moves forward, Steerprop plays a key role in unifying the vessel’s propulsion concept. While the centerline propeller will be manufactured by an external partner, it will be built entirely to Steerprop’s specifications—reflecting confidence in the company’s design expertise and system-level approach. The new Polarstern will continue the research conducted by AWI’s existing icebreaker, Polarstern. The state-of-the-art icebreaker will need the highest polar capabilities as it operates in some of the world’s harshest and most remote waters in the Antarctic and the Arctic regions. The new Polarstern will serve as a floating laboratory, gathering vital data on climate change and marine ecosystems, and it will supply Neumayer Station III, Germany’s research station in Antarctica.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35
U.S. Destroys Second Suspected Smuggling Boat off Venezuela,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-destroys-second-suspected-smuggling-boat-off-venezuela,,15/09/2025 20:08:50,,"As promised by Trump administration officials, the U.S. military has carried out a second strike on a Venezuelan boat target, killing three people. The strike is the second break with law enforcement precedent carried out in the theater this month. ""This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,"" said Trump in a social media post. ""The Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics . . . headed to the U.S."" Trump asserted that Venezuelan drug cartels pose a threat to U.S. national security, and warned that American forces would continue to ""hunt"" traffickers. The first strike was carried out by Special Operations Command using a missile-carrying MQ-9 Reaper drone, a familiar assassination method used in counterterror operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia and elsewhere. SOCOM has not traditionally engaged in maritime counternarcotics in U.S. Southern Command, normally managed by the U.S. Coast Guard under a law enforcement mandate with near-zero lethality. During the first intercept, the boat turned back before it was attacked by American forces, multiple officials told the New York Times. It was then struck repeatedly, killing 11 people - including some who survived the first hit and were killed by follow-up shots, two officials told The Intercept. The outlet reports that the Pentagon has restricted access to briefings on the initial strike, refusing to read in senior staff from certain oversight committees and members of House leadership. The Department of War confirmed that it is keeping information on the attack closely held. SOCOM has declined to comment on any involvement. Separately, on Monday, the Venezuelan government protested a boarding operation conducted by a U.S. Navy destroyer in waters off Venezuela's coast. Without attacking the vessel, destroyer USS Jason Dunham deployed an armed team ""who boarded and occupied the small, harmless boat for eight hours,"" according to Venezuela's foreign ministry.

Maritime New Zealand is monitoring the situation and reports there is no immediate danger, but the tow will have to wait for a break in the current heavy weather. The Japanese-owned product tanker Golden Mind (12,488 dwt) has been stranded near Stewart Island off the south coast of the South Island since Wednesday, September 10. AIS signals show the vessel departed the southern port of Bluff on September 9 and was bound for Timaru, New Zealand, where it was due to arrive on Saturday. The tanker is registered in Panama. It is 407 feet (124 meters) in length Maritime New Zealand reports it was advised the tanker, which was built in 2020, had experienced “steering difficulties.” The vessel’s owners contracted the ocean-going tug MMA Vision to aid the vessel. MMA Vision is under contract to Maritime New Zealand as a rescue tug in case of emergency for the Cook Strait ferries, but the authorities emphasized the tow was a private, commercial arrangement. The reports indicate the tanker, which had traveled from Risdon, Australia, to Bluff, New Zealand, had not issued a distress call. The crew remained aboard the vessel. Gale-force winds are currently impacting the region. Maritime New Zealand said the weather would determine when the tug was able to attach a line and begin towing the tanker. The plan is to take it to Timaru, a port on the east coast of the South Island.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35
Rheinmetall Enters Shipbuilding by Consolidating the German Defense Sector,https://maritime-executive.com/article/rheinmetall-enters-shipbuilding-by-consolidating-the-german-defense-sector,,15/09/2025 17:55:16,,"Rheinmetall, a German defense technology company best known for military equipment and as the largest European ammunition manufacturer, has agreed to acquire the naval shipbuilding operations of Lurssen Group. The deal had been rumored in recent weeks and is seen as the first step in the consolidation of the naval shipbuilding sector and German defense industries. Naval Vessels Lurssen (NVL) was separated from the yacht division in 2021 into an independent company. Formerly known as Lurssen Defence, it has a 150-year heritage with the company reporting it has built around 1,000 ships and delivered them to over 50 navies and coast guards. NVL today operates four shipyards (Peene-Werft / Wolgast, Blohm+Voss and Norderwerft / Hamburg, Neue Jadewerft / Wilhelmshaven) and specializes both in newbuilds and maintenance. Sales for the shipbuilder in 2024 were reported at around €1 billion. The companies say the terms of the acquisition were not being revealed, but Reuters is reporting NVL is being valued at approximately $1.59 billion. The companies said they expect to finalize terms in the coming weeks and, after antitrust approval, complete the transaction in early 2026. “With the newly agreed acquisition, we are taking a decisive step forward in consolidating the defense industry in Germany and Europe. Combined with Rheinmetall’s expertise, we are creating a vital German powerhouse for state-of-the-art vessels,” said Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall. “This acquisition will not only make us a manufacturer of floating platforms, but as an integrated naval powerhouse, we want to offer complete system solutions.” Rheinmetall, which is currently a supplier of system components for naval applications, highlights the opportunity to become a cross-domain systems company, saying that in time it will cover ground, land, sea, and space applications. Rheinmetall says it intends to meet the massive increase in demand from naval forces and rising procurement budgets with high-performance system solutions. It highlights the opportunities to provide an integrated solution from a single source for naval missiles and launchers, main and secondary guns for the navy, missile defense, sensors, and other electronics. The company told investors it anticipates Germany alone will spend around €31 billion on naval vessels over the next decade. “Especially in light of the heightened threat situation, we consider consolidation within the defense industry necessary and sensible,” said Friedrich Lürßen, Managing Partner of Lürssen Maritime Beteiligungen. “This is the only way to ensure our country's rapid defense capability.” The company highlights the increasing complexity of command and weapon systems and that ships are increasingly networked with other units and supplemented by autonomous units in the air, on the water, and underwater. The company said that this requires a more extensive integration of such weapon systems. Lurssen Group reports it will focus its operations on the construction of mega-yachts. It looks to focus on driving technological developments for the civilian sector. The sale agreement comes as another major German naval shipbuilder, TKMS, is set to emerge as an independent public company. The builder of submarines and frigates is being spun off from Thyssenkrupp. The step comes after US-based private investment firm Carlyle Group ended discussions to purchase a controlling stake in German naval shipbuilder. Previously, reports had stated that Fincantieri had been interested in a partnership with TKMS.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 04:27:35

Emissions remain 121 percent above the 2008 baseline, compliance costs are compounding, and the signals shaping investment - regulation, fuel pricing, penalties, availability, scalability - are moving at different speeds. The IMO needs to take a timeout. We need to get this right.” Launched at the ABS Sustainability Summit during London International Shipping Week, the seventh edition of the annual industry leading report shows that, despite progress on carbon intensity, shipping’s absolute emissions continue to climb. “Maritime decarbonization is a three-part calculus: 70 percent fuel selection, 15 percent energy efficiency, and 15 percent performance optimization. That 30 percent beyond fuel is where software plays a pivotal role and, given the current scarcity of green and blue fuel variants globally, is where the most immediate and scalable gains can be achieved,” Wiernicki said. “Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways, to extend the runway, which is energy efficiency technologies and onboard carbon capture, to cut well to wake emissions and prepare the endgame: nuclear and zero carbon fuels when they are safe, insurable and investible at scale.” The report also highlights the sharply increasing cost of compliance, modelling how a typical vessel trading within the EU could see daily operating costs increase from approximately $15,000 in 2028 to around $45,000 by 2035. Meanwhile, LNG is over-penalized in the early 2030s although it underpins blue fuels, keeps hard-to-abate segments compliant, and buys time for zero-carbon fuels, provided methane slip is addressed and pathways to bio-/e-LNG are opened. The Outlook, a compilation of ABS research and advanced analysis of progress with respect to sustainability challenges at sea and the readiness of the various solutions, highlights both the important bridging role of energy efficiency technologies and an impending retrofit capacity crunch at shipyards. Finally, the Outlook acknowledges the game-changing potential of nuclear propulsion technology beyond 2035.

Renault Group Joins Sail For Change To Boost UECC Environmental Initiative,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/renault-group-joins-sail-for-change-to-boost-uecc-environmental-initiative,,16/09/2025 01:54:37,,"[By: United European Car Carriers’] Renault Group has signed up to participate in United European Car Carriers’ (UECC) Sail for Change fuel-switching programme, making it the fifth automotive manufacturer to join the pioneering initiative that has seen major reductions in emissions through bunkering of liquefied biomethane on UECC vessels. Pilot shipments of Renault vehicles started on 1 July from Zeebrugge, Belgium to Esbjerg, Denmark under Sail for Change (S4C), which UECC estimates will result in an annual saving of 1 million kilograms (1000 tonnes) of Scope 3 CO2 emissions for the leading French car maker. “It is great to see that another valued customer has decided to come onboard Sail for Change as the programme has expanded since being launched a year ago, boosting bunkering of liquefied biomethane (LBM) to generate significant emissions reductions to meet the market demand for more sustainable maritime logistics,” said UECC CEO Glenn Edvardsen. “The programme has gained momentum with the support of our customers, which enables us to step up our sustainability efforts through increased investment in alternative fuel technologies for a greener future.” Flagship for decarbonisation The use of high-impact LBM, or bioLNG, as fuel on UECC’s fleet of dual and multi-fuel LNG Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTCs) enabled the company to cut its CO2 emissions by more than 107,000 tonnes in 2024 and it expects this reduction to increase by 50% to nearly 155,000 tonnes this year. Renault Group is looking to reduce emissions from its supply chain and logistics by at least 27% by 2030 as part of its ambition to achieve net zero in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050 under its so-called ‘Renaulution’ strategic plan. UECC’s Energy & Sustainability Manager Daniel Gent said: “Sail for Change is our flagship product for customers seeking to decarbonise, allowing them to make a direct, meaningful and certified impact on their supply chain emissions by offering marine transport powered by sustainable fuels, complemented by energy efficiency measures in UECC ship operations and onshore electrification.” Expanding fuel scope UECC has been able to realise major environmental efficiency gains for its fleet under S4C through the use of both biofuels and LBM, which allows carbon-neutral cargo shipments, as it seeks to expand the scope of the programme to embrace more sustainable fuels such as eLNG. BioLNG, which is being provided for S4C under a supply agreement with Titan Clean Fuels, is now seen by UECC as the key fuel to achieve its target of a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 towards its goal of net zero by 2040. “As a front-runner in decarbonisation of shipping, UECC is in alignment with the needs of the market through low-carbon ship operations and is delivering on our long-term promise to insulate our customers from regulatory penalties under the new green regime,” Gent added. ‘Hitting a sweet spot’ UECC has been able to avoid surcharges for its customers as its eco-friendly fleet is generating a compliance surplus under FuelEU Maritime that can be monetised through the pooling mechanism of the regulation. And this surplus is set to continue long into the future with increasing adoption of alternative fuels that are expected to account for 58% of the company’s fuel use by 2030. While its fleet retains a C rating or above to remain compliant with the IMO’s CII (Carbon Intensity Indicator), progressive reductions in emissions also enable UECC to minimise financial exposure under the EU Emissions Trading System for the benefit of its customers. Edvardsen concluded: “The success of the Sail for Change programme shows that it is hitting a sweet spot in the market amid regulatory pressure that represents a commercial driver for sustainability, proving that this is a key competitive differentiator both for UECC and its customers.”",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 09:30:53
Med Marine’s Med-A2800SD Tug For OMMP Successfully Completes Sea Trials,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/med-marine-s-med-a2800sd-tug-for-ommp-successfully-completes-sea-trials,,16/09/2025 01:50:22,,"[By: Med Marine] Med Marine proudly announced that the first of six next-generation RAmparts 2800 series tugboats, purpose-built for the Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports (OMMP), successfully completed her sea trials in the Black Sea on August 27th. Conducted under the close supervision of MED MARINE’s engineering team and classification society surveyors, the trials confirmed the vessel’s full alignment with design performance, from powerful bollard pull to agile manoeuvrability and operational resilience. This milestone comes just three months after the 28-meter harbor tug’s ceremonial launch on May 27th at MED MARINE’s Ere?li Shipyard, an event that marked the visible beginning of a six-vessel fleet project arising from the contract signed between OMMP and MED MARINE in November 2023. Having successfully completed her sea trials, MED MARINE is excited to continue advancing its collaboration with OMMP through this high-performance harbor tug. Measuring 28 meters in length, this MED-A2800SD tug is engineered to deliver a minimum bollard pull of 60 tonnes ahead. Designed by Robert Allan Ltd., she meets Class FIFI-E requirements and is powered by two medium-speed diesel engines. Her open aft deck, capable of accommodating two 10-foot containers, ensures operational flexibility, while her robust configuration prepares her for a wide range of missions including ship handling, towing, mooring, escorting, pushing, and firefighting. As the first in a series of six sister vessels, this tug embodies the fusion of MED MARINE’s advanced shipbuilding expertise and OMMP’s progressive vision for safer, more efficient port operations. More than just a technical achievement, the successful completion of her sea trials highlights the coordinated efforts, meticulous planning, and mutual dedication that define this partnership. Technical specifications of the tugboat: Length: 28,20 m Beam: 11,50 m Depth: 5,49 m Draft: 5,40 m Gross Tonnage: 428 Bollard Pull: 60 tons Speed: 12 knots @ 80% MCR Crew: 8",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 09:30:53
World Shipping Council Launches Cargo Safety Program to Prevent Fires,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/world-shipping-council-launches-cargo-safety-program-to-prevent-fires,,16/09/2025 00:53:52,,"[By: World Shipping Council] The World Shipping Council (WSC) today announced the launch of its Cargo Safety Program, an industry-led initiative to detect misdeclared and undeclared dangerous goods in order to prevent ship fires, protect crews, vessels, customers’ cargo, and the marine environment. The program combines AI-powered cargo screening and common inspection standards to identify misdeclared and undeclared high-risk shipments before they are loaded. Ship fires are at their highest level in over a decade, according to Allianz's Safety and Shipping Review 2025. Misdeclared dangerous goods are a leading cause of ship fires, reported as responsible for more than a quarter of all cargo-related incidents. “We have seen too many tragic incidents where misdeclared cargo has led to catastrophic fires, including the loss of life,” said Joe Kramek, President and CEO of the World Shipping Council. “The WSC Cargo Safety Program strengthens the industry’s safety net by combining shared screening technology, common inspection standards, and real-world feedback to reduce risk.” At the heart of the program is a digital cargo screening tool powered by the National Cargo Bureau’s (NCB) technology. It scans millions of bookings in real time using keyword searches, trade pattern recognition and AI-driven algorithms to identify potential risks. Alerts are reviewed by carriers and, when needed, verified through targeted physical inspections. The program also establishes common inspection standards for verifying shipments and an incident feedback loop to ensure lessons from real-world cases strengthen prevention. At launch, carriers representing more than 70 percent of global TEU capacity have joined the program. “By working together and using the best available tools, we can identify risks early, act quickly, and prevent accidents before they happen,” Kramek said. “The Cargo Safety Program is a powerful new layer of protection, but it does not replace the fundamental obligation shippers have to declare dangerous goods accurately. That is the starting point for safety, and it is required under international law.” The launch builds on WSC’s longstanding work to improve maritime safety, from developing cargo handling rules to supporting environmental protection measures. The program will continue to evolve, with regular updates to its technology and standards to address new and emerging risks. “Ocean carriers transport the goods vital to the flow of global trade, and we have a responsibility to move them safely,” Kramek added. “By raising the bar on cargo screening, we are protecting lives, safeguarding the environment and improving the integrity of the global supply chain.”",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 09:30:53

OMSA Wants U.S. Coast Guard to End All Type Approvals for Shipboard Gear,https://maritime-executive.com/article/omsa-wants-u-s-coast-guard-to-end-all-type-approvals-for-shipboard-gear,,16/09/2025 06:49:36,,"The Trump administration has announced ambitious goals to deregulate every industry, and maritime is no exception. That's welcome news for many in the business, including the members of the Offshore Marine Services Association (OMSA), who have proposed a significant rollback in U.S. Coast Guard type approval regulations for safety gear - the familiar standards for flares, ladders, rescue boats, fire doors, ballast water treatment systems, and other shipboard safety gear. Instead, OMSA says, the shipowner should be allowed to buy equipment that is independently tested and certified, without the burden of the Coast Guard type approval process. ""OMSA respectfully urges the USCG to revoke all regulations which require the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) to approve a type of equipment before this equipment can be installed or used on a U.S.-flagged vessel. Adopting this recommendation will eliminate 95 regulations without any adverse impacts to safety, the environment, or property,"" asserted OMSA President and CEO Aaron C. Smith. OMSA held up inflatable liferafts as an example. The USCG’s type approval rule runs to 11,000 words, and it repeats the ISO requirements that the rafts already have to meet on the factory floor, according to OMSA. Meeting the additional review of type approval adds cost and time for equipment manufacturers, and OMSA thinks that safety would be just as good without a Coast Guard type approval review. ""With all these rules, USCG inspectors are being diverted from critical safety work to duplicate tasks already handled by global standards bodies,” said Smith. “This is about making smart, efficient decisions that support American jobs and industry. Streamlining the system will save time, reduce costs, and keep our fleet competitive.” According to OMSA, the type approval process also makes it harder for its members to get the equipment they need from vendors. For example, USCG type approved fast rescue boat engines are no longer distributed in Louisiana, so operators have to look far and wide for replacements, causing delays. If the type approval requirement were lifted, the association argues, operators could use locally-available engines without any difficulty.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 15:41:52
Five Missing in Catastrophic Trawler Collision off Mauritania,https://maritime-executive.com/article/five-missing-in-catastrophic-trawler-collision-off-mauritania,,16/09/2025 02:06:06,,"A collision between two fishing boats left five people missing off the coast of Mauritania last week, prompting a large-scale search. The Gambian-flagged Right Whale and the Mauritania-flagged Tafra 3 collided off the coast on Friday, in fine weather and calm surface conditions. A video obtained by Faro de Vigo and Voz de Galicia appears to show that Right Whale's bow hit Tafra 3 amidships on the starboard side; Tafra had trawl cables visibly trailing astern, indicating that she was engaged in fishing operations or working on gear over the side in the moments before impact. After the collision, the two ships remained connected and Right Whale continued to push Tafra ahead for about two minutes. When Tafra finally drifted away, it became apparent that the smaller vessel had a wide-open tear in her hull all the way from the main deck level down. She listed further and further to starboard, then sank by the stern in about 50 meters of water. Spanish outlet Informacion reports that the vessel sank so fast that the crew could not deploy their rafts. Instead, they all donned lifejackets, and the rafts popped up later by hydrostatic release. 21 survivors were rescued, including three Spanish nationals and at least one Russian citizen. One of the Spaniards sustained a head injury and required stitches. Five Mauritanian nationals remained missing, and SAR operations reportedly continued through the weekend. The master and first officer of the Right Whale have reportedly been arrested, and a local investigation into the cause of the casualty is under way.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 15:41:52

China - Philippines Vessels Collide as Water Cannons Used on Supply Mission,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-philippines-vessels-collide-as-water-cannons-used-on-supply-mission,,16/09/2025 20:50:00,,"The Philippines’ monthly supply mission to the disputed area in the South China Sea near the Scarborough Shoal resulted in another incident between the two countries, with accusations of illegal activity from both sides. While the versions of the incident differ, both sides highlighted the use of water cannons against one Filipino vessel, while China released video of the ship hitting one of its Coast Guard vessels. The Philippines Coast Guard and the Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources highlighted it as a regular resupply mission to more than 35 Filipino fishing boats operating in the area around the shoal. At least three Coast Guard vessels, two bureau vessels with the supplies, and a government-owned fish processing vessel, Mamalakaya, were on the mission. They were bringing essential fuel and ice to the fishermen, according to the Philippine authorities. The Chinese broadcast announcements early this morning, September 16, of a live fire exercise in the region, and shortly after 0900 local time, the vessels began to interact. They were at various positions ranging between 17, 14, and 10 nautical miles from the shoal. CCG Employs Water Cannons Against BRP Datu Gumbay Piang This morning, the BRP Datu Gumbay Piang (MMOV 3014), operated by the Department of Agriculture - Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR), was targeted by two China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels while engaged in... pic.twitter.com/bzVieZEoha The Philippines says a China Coast Guard vessel began blasting one of the bureau’s boats with its water cannon in an incident that lasted for 29 minutes. Another vessel had begun using its water cannon when the Filipino vessel was 17 miles from the shoal. A third vessel later attempted to block the ship when it was 10 miles from the shoal and to use its water cannon, but the Philippines says its vessel was able to execute safety maneuvers. The spokesperson for the Philippine Coast Guard, Jay Tarriela, released a statement saying the bureau’s boat sustained significant damage, including shattered windows on the bridge, damage to the captain’s cabin, and electrical short circuits. The glass from the windows injured one sailor aboard the vessel. The Chinese released the video showing the collision while calling the actions by the Philippines “illegal activities” and a “deliberate provocation.” They asserted the Philippines “intentionally rammed” the China Coast Guard vessel and was acting in “an unprofessional and dangerous manner.” They said regulatory measures were enforced, reporting the broadcasting of warnings via loudspeakers and using water cannons. The vessels ultimately disengaged, and the Filipino boat rejoined the others and completed the resupply mission. China is contending that the Philippines sent more than 10 vessels into the area, coming from various directions. There have been frequent confrontations between the Chinese and the Filipinos during these resupply missions. Tensions were further raised last week when China announced it was designating a nature reserve in parts of the area. The Philippines filed a formal protest, continuing to assert that the area is recognized as part of its EEZ.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 21:29:27
National Pump Company Expands NSF-Certified Material Options,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/national-pump-company-expands-nsf-certified-material-options,,16/09/2025 11:53:51,,"[By: National Pump Company] National Pump Company, a recognized market leader in vertical turbine pumps, is expanding its NSF 61-certified product catalog with a substantial range of new material options, giving customers more flexibility than ever before in meeting specific project requirements. This latest update marks the most significant advancement to date. With the addition of 19 materials, the total number of NSF-certified choices has increased from 36 to 55 across 13 certified components. This expansion raises the number of potential component and material combinations to more than 199 million, giving engineers and end users an unmatched level of flexibility when specifying pumps. These extensive NSF material additions include new mechanical seal options, expanded wear ring choices such as 17-4PH for bowls and impellers, and carbon steel alternatives for bowl components supporting both fabrication and machining from round stock. National Pump Company has also substantially broadened its supplier base for many of these options. More suppliers have been qualified for key components like coated column pipe, mechanical seals, tube assemblies, and marine bearings, ensuring greater availability, procurement flexibility, and responsiveness to customer preferences. Enhanced supplier variety also applies to packing materials, valves, fittings, tubing (including PVC), and fastening methods such as rivet nuts and pop rivets for securing submersible screens. These changes allow customers expanded selection based on material performance, cost and availability considerations, while preserving full NSF 61 certification integrity. “Expanding our NSF-certified material catalog allows us to provide customers with more choices and more ways to achieve their performance objectives,” said Andrew Dewar, Vice President at National Pump Company. “Every expansion reflects our commitment to engineering excellence, continuous improvement, and meeting the evolving needs of the markets we serve.” For more information on NSF-certified products and expanded material options, visit https://www.nationalpumpcompany.com/products/nsf-certified-products.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 21:29:27
ABB To Power Singapore’s First Floating LNG Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/abb-to-power-singapore-s-first-floating-lng-terminal,,16/09/2025 11:47:25,,"Hanwha Ocean, one of the leading shipbuilders in South Korea, has awarded ABB the contract to supply a complete electric power and propulsion system for Singapore’s first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. The contract is the latest milestone in the long-standing collaboration between ABB and Hanwha Ocean. ABB ’s integrated electrical system on board the Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) will comprise a medium voltage generator, 6.6kV switchboards for cargo and regasification, and the motor, transformer and drive for propulsion. The floating terminal will also feature ABB’s remote control and remote diagnostics system, its proven condition monitoring solution and an enhanced power protection system (EPPS). The FSRU will be delivered to owner Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) in 2027 and contracted for long-term charter by Singapore LNG Corporation Pte Ltd (Singapore LNG). With capacity for 200,000 cubic meters of LNG, the FSRU will be moored at Jurong Port and connected to the gas network in 2030, under the management of MOL. The new FSRU is a strategic investment in Singapore’s energy infrastructure and a key part of the city state’s energy transition toward net-zero emissions. Singapore LNG has signed contracts to process five million tons of LNG per annum at a floating facility, adding flexibility and increasing Singapore’s LNG importing capacity by 50 percent compared to the current single landside terminal in Jurong. “We are proud to continue our long-lasting collaboration with Hanwha Ocean by supplying an integrated electrical system for Singapore’s first FSRU,” said Rune Braastad, Global Business Line Manager, Marine Systems, ABB’s Marine & Ports division. “This collaboration underscores our shared commitment to innovation, reliability, and sustainability, and is ABB’s latest contribution to the critical infrastructure supporting Singapore’s position as an important LNG hub in Asia.” Wood Mackenzie notes that Asia Pacific accounted for two-thirds of global LNG demand in 2024, and anticipates the high level of activity to continue as stakeholders balance energy security with economic realities. The strong outlook highlights the significance of the enduring and growing relationship between Hanwha Ocean and ABB – as well as ABB’s continued contribution to infrastructure development in Singapore, where it began operating in 1971. Hanwha Ocean has delivered 23.4 percent of the global gas fleet and recently became the first shipbuilder to complete its 200th LNG carrier. It is also one of the leading builders of FSRUs in the world.",Maritime Executive,16/09/2025 21:29:27

ITF London Staff Start First-Ever Strike Against the Union Federation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/itf-london-staff-start-first-ever-strike-against-the-union-federation,,16/09/2025 23:42:00,,"The unionized office staff of the International Transport Workers’ Federation, represented by the union Unite, has taken the unusual step of going on strike against their union employer. More than 100 workers at the London headquarters walked off the job on Monday, September 15, and are saying they will remain on strike at least through September 18 after negotiations broke down with the leadership of the ITF. The employees had taken their first-ever strike vote in July 2025, with 89 percent supporting a full strike and 90 percent an action short of a full strike. This came after the workers strongly rejected (72 percent voted against) a new proposal from management of the ITF. Unite the Union at the time responded on July 17 with a new series of work rules for the ITF workers, including a ban on overtime. They had planned one-day work stoppages on July 22 and 29, but agreed to postpone the walkout after gaining a new negotiation pledge from management. An actual picket line went up in front of the London headquarters of the ITF, which is a federation of international transport workers' unions. The workers who are normally working to protect the rights of seafarers worldwide find themselves on the picket line this time. A virtual picket line was also set up elsewhere, including the ITF’s current Maritime Roundtable in Cyprus. Unite is also saying that unless there is progress, the industrial action will continue. The union reports that management has informed them it was canceling a planned September 17 negotiation meeting. At issue is a planned reorganization of the ITF and its operations. The organization, which traces its origins to its founding in London in 1896, has announced it would be reorganizing its London-based staff, although Unite says the changes could also involve regional employees. Unite reports that the ITF planned cuts for a quarter of the workforce this year. According to their report, half the ITF employees ultimately applied for a voluntary separation scheme, but Unite says others are still at risk. “Our members have been clear that the restructuring process has been a poorly managed disaster from start to finish,” Unite wrote announcing the strike. Unite is demanding consultations and protections for the remaining employees. They also cite the stress and anxiety the process has created in the employees. Also at issue is a plan to restructure pay at the ITF. The federation says it is working on a fair, transparent, and competitive compensation program. Unite contends that the ITF management also proposed a pay freeze for most staff members. They assert the federation, however, was planning to increase the minimum and maximum pay rates of senior management, something the ITF denies. The ITF workers represented by Unite voted down a new proposal last week from ITF management. They said the strike is necessary to make progress on the negotiations.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30
Germany and the Netherlands to Overhaul Subsidies for Renewable Energy,https://maritime-executive.com/article/germany-and-the-netherlands-to-overhaul-subsidies-for-renewable-energy,,16/09/2025 22:54:58,,"The governments of both Germany and the Netherlands are examining how they structure renewable energy subsidies, looking to spur the industry while managing costs for the end users. Both countries faced disappointments earlier this year when planned auctions for offshore wind failed to generate interest, and they have been working on new plans for their industries. “In various parts of the world and in Europe, the sector is struggling with rising costs, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about sufficient demand,” said the Netherlands’ Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Climate Policy and Green Growth, Sophie Hermans. “Without intervention, the rollout of wind farms is at risk of grinding to a halt. The Offshore Wind Energy Action Plan offers additional support for the sector in the coming period and details several additional measures. This will enable the next cabinet to make swift decisions on these matters.”? Hermans highlighted the danger that, going forward, the pace of offshore wind farm rollout is slower than in recent years. In May, the Netherlands delayed an offshore wind license auction when it became clear that the developers required subsidies to go forward. The Netherlands has 4.7 GW of installed capacity. Its goal for 21 GW was delayed from 2030 to 2032. The Netherlands continues to see offshore wind energy as a driving force in the Dutch energy transition. It will also help the Dutch to locally source more of their power. To prevent a slowdown from jeopardizing the country’s long-term plans, Hermans said the new action plan calls for allocating €1 billion to support the construction of 2 GW of new offshore wind farms next year. The plan also anticipates longer-term support efforts for the sector. In the short term, in addition to the subsidy for the construction projects, the Netherlands government is also extending its Indirect Compensation Cost program by one year with an additional €150 million. This will also improve the future business case for offshore wind farms, according to Hermans. They also plan to work on the demand side of the power market. In the longer term, the Dutch cabinet is preparing a bill to enable the Contracts for Difference approach for wind farms, which is already in use in the United Kingdom. Operators receive a subsidy if their revenues fall below a certain level and pay the state when electricity prices are high. The cabinet is also exploring a guarantee fund to support long-term energy contracts. Another step will consider the timeline for the required construction for wind farms for the developers. The cabinet is also exploring reorganizing the plans for the Ten Noorden van de Waddeneilanden site to possibly incorporate it with the Doordewind energy zone, which would Herman said lead to higher revenue per turbine. Germany faced similar challenges after it failed to receive bids in its most recent round. The new government’s Economy Minister, Katherina Reiche, on Monday, September 15, said they needed to address bringing down the cost of energy to make the shift to renewable energy successful. Germany can still achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2045, but the energy supply must be made more efficient so as not to overburden industry and consumers with the costs of the transition, the minister said. Expansion must be better managed, and a new subsidy plan will be announced. Germany’s goal is to systematically lower its subsidies. For example, the minister called for abolishing a fixed rate for solar power from new installations. For wind power, Germany is also considering CfDs as well as a system of revenue recovery. Reiche notes that German industry is slowly moving away from oil, gas, and coal. However, they highlight that 54 percent of Germany’s electricity was generated from renewables in the first half of 2025. As part of the new plan, the ministry said it believes the prior government overestimated demand. Working on a revised plan, they asserted that Germany remains on track to source 80 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30
U.S. Coast Guard Invests $50M to Revamp Mariner Licensing System,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-invests-50m-to-revamp-mariner-licensing-system,,16/09/2025 22:14:34,,"American mariners are used to dealing with an extended and time-consuming administrative process whenever they go for a license upgrade or renewal. The U.S. Coast Guard's credentialing system works, but only slowly, and with considerable friction - a known impediment to creating new mariners and keeping current ones working in the industry. The service is aware of the difficulties and frustrations of the existing process, and with the giant cash infusion it received under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it is making a landmark investment in its IT infrastructure. To revamp the process, the service awarded Salesforce consultancy Stealth Solutions Inc. a contract worth up to $50 million over five years. The scope covers everything related to updating and streamlining the credentialing process and mariner credentialing requirements. Stealth is in Sterling, Virginia, just an hour's drive from the Coast Guard's credentialing headquarters in the small country town of Martinsburg, West Virginia. The project also includes work on the web platform Navita, the Latin word for ""mariner,"" a planned public-facing portal for applicants and employee-facing database for mariner documents and approvals. It is intended to replace manual processes that slow down credential review and issuance. Navita was initiated last year with funds in the 2024 Department of Homeland Security Appropriation Act. The Coast Guard has now ordered the development of the platform's first release, worth $3.8 million. ""The Navita system represents a transformative leap forward in supporting America’s maritime industry, providing our merchant mariners—who are vital to our nation’s economy and security—with a streamlined process to receive their credentials with speed and focus,"" said Rear Adm.

Amateur Pilot Pleads Guilty to Landing at Naval Base and Stealing a Truck,https://maritime-executive.com/article/amateur-pilot-pleads-guilty-to-landing-at-naval-base-and-stealing-a-truck,,16/09/2025 21:02:58,,"A man who decided to fly a small private airplane onto a far-flung naval base off California - twice - has been charged with criminal offenses and faces a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. Along the way, he demonstrated that it is possible to enter a small base by aircraft, then move around inside the security perimeter for hours before capture. Andrew Kyle White, 37 and a resident of California, was an amateur pilot. In 2023, he flew a lightweight Glasair Glastar airplane out to San Clemente Island, southwest of Long Beach. San Clemente is owned by the U.S. Navy and lightly inhabited, with just 150 residents; administratively it is part of Naval Base Coronado, but most of it is wildland. There are two small airfields towards the northwestern end and a very short, rough and disused airstrip at the southeastern tip. White decided to land his light aircraft on one of these strips - and was quickly handed a letter informing him that landing on San Clemente was a federal offense, and one not to be repeated. In April 2025, White flew back to the island anyways, and once again landed at an airfield. This time, he stole a pickup truck and made a circuit of the island - even attempting to ram gates, prosecutors said. Remarkably, he managed to move about the island for hours, forcing the Navy to dispatch security teams and expend about $500,000 to resolve the security breach. This time, White was arrested and charged with stealing government property and illegally entering a naval base. He has pleaded guilty to both charges and faces up to 10 years in prison at sentencing.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30
DNV Says Shipping is Moving from “Ambition to Action” on Decarbonization,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dnv-says-shipping-is-moving-from-ambition-to-action-on-decarbonization,,16/09/2025 20:07:47,,"Momentum is building in the shipping industry with a growing number of initiatives to address decarbonization, concludes DNV. The group launched the ninth edition of its Maritime Forecast to 2050 with the Energy Transition Outlook 2025 during the London International Shipping Week. “The industry is moving from ambition to action,” said DNV, pointing to the growing number of orders for dual-fuel vessels and the emergence of new technologies. They, however, note that supply and infrastructure are falling far behind, but reiterated the industry’s long-held belief that there will be no one singular solution to the challenges that lie ahead. Introducing the study and providing his annual view on the state of the industry, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime of DNV, highlighted three important shifts that he sees as currently shaping the industry. He pointed to the geopolitical challenges, such as the Red Sea and Ukraine, which have driven tonnage miles “through the roof,” decarbonization, and technology in all its forms, from wind propulsion to the growing discussion about Artificial Intelligence (AI). The anticipated adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework will shape the future, and DNV has focused the new report on exploring the implications of the regulation and the status of the fuel transition. It also used the opportunity to present new concepts, which DNV believes could play a key role in helping its overall goals. One of the key challenges that has been repeatedly highlighted is the lack of supply of zero-carbon fuels. DNV reports the supply will have to grow twentyfold based on its estimates. Based on the lack of production capacity, Ørbeck-Nilssen called for keeping all pathways open, including LNG. He points out that despite the challenges of a carbon-based fuel and concerns about well-to-tank emissions, that the growth of biomethane has the opportunity to transition LNG, which itself is viewed as a transitional fuel. He also points out that one of the methods required is reducing overall fuel consumption. DNV is proposing “Carbon Capture Corridors,” similar to the concept for Green Shipping Corridors. As part of their research, they looked at the opportunity for the largest bulkers, tankers, and containerships to employ onboard carbon capture. They call for the development of the offloading/storage capabilities in 20 ports key to the trade of these large vessels, highlighting that this could reduce emissions by 20 percent. Among the concerns that the industry will have to confront is DNV’s conclusion that the IMO framework will double costs, but they point out that it is manageable through a range of strategies. Exploring a case study of an 18,000 dwt chemical tanker, they looked at biofuels versus the option of paying the penalties in the IMO regime. They concluded that biofuels, which are easy to use, will also be more cost-efficient. During the industry leaders’ discussion, it was also pointed out that adapting larger vessels to the new standards will be easier than adapting smaller ships. The expectation is that operators will start with their biggest ships, while it was also pointed out that shipbuilders do not have the capacity for what some have proposed with large-scale scrapping and replacement tonnage. Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of IMO, spoke confidentially of the coming adoption of the framework at the upcoming meeting in October. He said there are negotiations, but it will proceed with DNV concluding that adoption would provide greater certainty to the industry and hopefully spur more investments in the infrastructure and technology needed to achieve the goals. Also contributing is DNV’s estimate that the Net-Zero Fund created by the IMO will receive $10 to $15 billion annually. They note that work has yet to be done on the guidelines and how the funding will be used, but believe it could be a major factor in helping the industry toward the IMO’s goals for decarbonization.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30
Israel Strikes Port of Hodeidah in Yemen in Response to Houthi Attacks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/israel-strikes-port-of-hodeidah-in-yemen-in-response-to-houthi-attacks,,16/09/2025 19:07:58,,"Israeli fighters hit the Port of Hodeidah, Yemen, in a targeted attack in response to the ongoing missile and drone launches from the Houthis targeting Israel. The attack came just two hours after a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Force posted a message warning civilians and ships anchored in the port to evacuate the area immediately. Reports on the Houthi-controlled Al Masirah TV said that 12 Israeli strikes targeted the docks in the port. Three docks were reportedly damaged, with Israeli media saying it was designed to keep the facilities out of service for several more weeks. Israel has repeatedly struck the port facilities as well as other targets in Yemen. Reuters is quoting residents as saying the attack lasted for about 10 minutes. The Israelis said the attack was in response to the repeated attacks by the Houthis using drones and missiles. They said the port was targeted because it used to transfer combat materials, including imports from Iran. While Israel has been successful at intercepting many of the Houthis’ drones and missiles, reports said the Israeli authorities were angered by a drone that breached security and damaged an airport in southern Israel. One person was reportedly injured when the windows were blown out at the Eilat airport. The Houthis’ spokesperson, Yahya Saree, posted a message on social media claiming that their air defense had been activated and disrupted the Israeli attack. He claimed they had been able to “cause great confusion” and that some of the Israeli formations were forced to leave Yemeni airspace before carrying out their attacks. Several hours after the Israelis struck, the Houthis said they had launched a hypersonic ballistic missile directed toward Tel-Aviv. Israeli media said it was intercepted.

Maritime Technologies Forum Releases Guidance on EV Fire Risks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maritime-technologies-forum-releases-guidance-on-ev-fire-risks,,16/09/2025 18:50:04,,"The Maritime Technologies Forum is launching a new report on September 30, which outlines a top-level framework for ship operators on how the risk of electronic Vehicle (EV) fires onboard pure car and truck carriers and ferries should best be mitigated. Onboard EV fires have been occurring for many years, though it has not always been clear to what extent EV self-ignitions have been to blame. One of the first incidents was a contained fire in a single EV-powered car on board the MS Pearl of Scandinavia (IMO: 8701674) in November 2010, in transit between Oslo and Copenhagen. But a fire which broke out on December 31, 2018 on board the VC Sincerity Ace (IMO: 9519092) en route from Yokohama to Honolulu with 3500 Nissan cars onboard took ten days to burn out, and five crew were lost. Her sister ship VC Felicity Ace (IMO: 9293911), with 4000 Volkswagen cars on board, burned for a week before sinking off the Azores in February 2022. More recently, the VC Morning Midas (IMO: 9289910) caught fire and sank in the North Pacific in June, with 746 EVs out of a cargo of over 3000 vehicles on board. When such incidents occur, there is frequently debate over whether EVs have initiated such fires, or whether EVs have contributed to the subsequent spread of fires and the difficulties of bringing them under control. The consensus appears to be that while EV over-heating and spontaneous combustion is rare, the characteristics of lithium batteries complicate and prolong the fire-fighting response. Amongst a plethora of advice offered to mariners, the Maritime Technologies Forum’s new report summarizes a number of best practice ideas, among which are the following: Early Detection: EVs need to be fitted with alarms to give early warning of battery over-heating, and wireless-connected to ship fire safety networks. Prevention of Explosion: EV fires release heavier than air flammable gases, so on-board electrical equipment lively to be in fire-affected areas should be of a specification suppressing initiation of explosions. Fire Protection and Prevention of Fire Spread: EV fires produce greater heat than conventional fires, requiring a re-evaluation of structural fire protection heat resistance standards in FTP 2010 that are currently based on conventional vehicle characteristics. Manual Firefighting; portable manned firefighting equipment should be used in the early stages of a fire where this is possible, so as to avoid risks to ship stability caused by excess water accumulation. Fixed Firefighting: the report considers the relative merits of carbon dioxide, high expansion foam and water-based fire-extinguishing systems, and makes observations. Crew Safety During Firefighting: the report gives advice on crew safety during firefighting, particularly regarding loading schemes to facilitate access and the need for longer-duration breathing apparatus. Safety Management Systems: the report recommends enhancements to crew fire response training, to cover particular dangers relating to EVs and fire drills to tackle EV fires. The Maritime Technologies Forum report is to be launched during the London International Shipping Week, and is to be submitted for consideration by the IMO, with the aim of prompting improvements to mandatory regulations.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30
Sanctioned Tankers Begin to React to Adani’s Ban from Indian Ports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/sanctioned-tankers-begin-to-react-to-adani-s-ban-from-indian-ports,,16/09/2025 18:06:05,,"Days after India’s large private port operator, Adani Group, was reported to have issued a ban on handling sanctioned tankers, it appears to have impacted one vessel. Others, however, are still proceeding to India and Adani’s Mundra port in northwest India. Mundra is a major economic gateway that Adani reports caters to northern India with multimodal connectivity. The deep draft, all-weather port is the largest commercial port in India, and it includes the MPT-1 terminal, which is equipped with four dedicated berths specifically designed for the handling of liquid cargoes. It plays a key role in India’s oil imports and contributed to India becoming the largest buyer of seaborne Russian oil. Mundra, according to media reports, handles around 180,000 barrels of oil per day. Media reports revealed that Adani Group had sent a memorandum last week informing all customers and port agents that it had decided to ban all sanctioned tankers from its terminals. The group said it would be observing the sanctions imposed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. Analysts have been watching closely to see if the ban would be enforced, and over the weekend, Reuters reported that one tanker proceeded to the terminal, but another shadow fleet tanker appeared to be diverting from Adani’s Mundra terminal. Asked by the Indian media, a spokesperson for Adani said the ban was in effect for future sailings and that they would still accept tankers that were en route when the ban was announced. The crude oil tanker Spartan (158,070 dwt) reached Mundra and offloaded a reported 1 million barrels. The ship, which was built in 2010, departed Mundra on September 16 bound for the Suez Canal. The ship is now registered in Oman and managed from Dubai. It previously sailed for Sovcomflot SCF. The tanker was sanctioned in December 2024 by the United Kingdom, European Union, and Switzerland for its involvement in the Russian oil trade. Another tanker operating since July as the Noble Walker, however, has changed destinations away from Mundra. The vessel departed Primorsk, Russia, on August 21. Built in 2004, it is owned by a Chinese company but reports sailing under the flag of Aruba. Equisis lists it as a false flag. The ship was sanctioned by the UK at the end of 2024 and by the EU and Canada in 2025. Its AIS signal switched and now shows the tanker bound for Vadinar, India, which is a state-run port. India continues to be under pressure from the West to curtail its imports of Russian oil. Last month, Donald Trump doubled the US’s tariff on India to 50 percent as punishment for its purchases of Russian oil. The U.S. is holding out the prospects of a new tariff deal with India, with reports that representatives of the two countries were meeting today, September 16, to lay the groundwork for the next round of negotiations.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 04:27:30

Real-Time Visibility Transforms Barge Operations,https://maritime-executive.com/features/real-time-visibility-transforms-barge-operations,,17/09/2025 02:37:00,,"The inland barge industry stands at a critical juncture. While we've long known that barges move cargo more efficiently than trucks or rail—past studies have shown 647 ton-miles per gallon compared to rail's 477 and trucking's 145—our operational visibility has lagged behind other transportation modes. This disconnect between our mode's advantages and technological capabilities has cost operators millions while the larger conversation around supply chain digitization has only intensified. Ocean carriers and trucking companies alike have embraced real-time tracking as table stakes. Shippers increasingly expect the same level of visibility from their barge operators. Those who can't provide it risk losing customers to modes that can, regardless of cost or environmental impact. The Hidden Cost of Operational Blind Spots Operational efficiency challenges in inland maritime are intensified by increasingly volatile conditions. Weather conditions, variables locking time, and river levels can all introduce significant delays and financial consequences to voyages, while rate volatility adds another layer of complexity. For example, look at the impact of recent weather-related disruptions on the Mississippi River. In 2022, a backup of more than 2000 barges was reported due to low water levels. In 2023, record-low levels returned for the second year in a row and weather fluctuations again significantly impacted barge rates for major commodities. Looking at these dramatic fluctuations, it is easy to see how many operators struggle to predict revenue and optimize their operations without access to real-time data. Consider a typical scenario: a barge carrying agricultural commodities approaches a grain terminal without advance notice of its precise arrival time. The terminal, unable to predict the exact timing, schedules conservatively, resulting in a scramble for a berth or adequate labor. The result? Even small delays can lead to demurrage charges or have downstream impacts on scheduled services such as cleaning and maintenance for the operator. With real-time visibility, terminals can optimize berth assignments and labor scheduling while carriers avoid costly delays and better coordinate their fleet operations—a win-win that reduces costs and improves service reliability for all parties. BargeOS: Transforming Operations Through Intelligence BargeOS addresses these challenges by providing real-time intelligence across tracking, 3rd party data integration, and AI-driven predictive analytics to transform how barge operators manage their fleets. Visibility goes beyond traditional AIS with satellite-connected GPS tracking devices for maximum coverage, while BargeOS Autopilot introduces a breakthrough way to enable precise tracking without installing hardware. By ingesting email nominations and traffic updates, BargeOS Autopilot converts unstructured communications into structured voyage data inputted directly into the dashboard giving operators full visibility into fleet movements. This means stakeholders can instantly monitor barge positions and status,eliminating hours of manual entry and providing a reliable single source of truth. BargeOS also simplifies voyage planning and quoting processes. By analyzing historical voyage data, real-time lock conditions, water levels, weather, and other external factors, the tool leverages powerful AI to predict potential disruptions and suggest optimal routing. Operators can proactively adjust schedules and resources to reduce idle time, optimize throughput, and better serve customers leading to efficiency gains across the supply chain. Revenue Optimization Through Asset Intelligence The financial impact of improved visibility extends well beyond customer satisfaction. Faster turnaround times directly increase asset utilization. For a typical barge operator, even small improvements in efficiency could translate to additional voyages, with each additional voyage representing increased revenue. The platform also enables operators to optimize voyage planning through historical performance data. By analyzing patterns in transit times, weather impacts, and terminal efficiency, operators can continue to make more informed decisions about routing, scheduling, and capacity allocation. Building Customer Trust Through Transparency In today's competitive transportation market, trust has become a differentiating factor. Customers increasingly value transparency and reliability over purely cost-based considerations. BargeOS enables operators to more effectively support those long-term customer partnerships. For example, the platform allows carriers to give customers access to monitor their shipments in real-time, and receive automated status updates. This transparency reduces the amount of direct communication required between shipper and carrier while simultaneously improving customer confidence in service reliability. When customers can see exactly where their cargo is and when it will arrive, they're more likely to choose barge transportation for future shipments. This customer loyalty translates directly into revenue stability and growth opportunities. Competitive Advantage in Digital Supply Chains Customer system integration plays a critical role in digital supply chains. BargeOS provides APIs that allow customers to incorporate barge tracking data directly into their own logistics management systems. The platform offers a single source of truth for all documents, allowing for faster auditing and payment of invoices. With enhanced back office processing and new integration capabilities, operators are positioned as sophisticated supply chain partners rather than simply transportation providers. Data analytics capabilities also help operators identify new business opportunities for growth. By analyzing cargo flows and customer patterns, operators can identify opportunities for improved lane efficiency, discover new potential market segments or optimize their service offerings to meet emerging demand. With financial performance analysis, operators can easily monitor costs, see revenue per voyage, track demurrage and better understand asset and portfolio utilization. Implementation and ROI Deploying BargeOS requires minimal disruption. The platform's hardware can be installed quickly on existing vessels, and the cloud-based software requires no on-site IT infrastructure. Most operators achieve full functionality within weeks and ROI typically manifests within the first year through improved asset utilization and reduced operational costs. Enhanced customer satisfaction and retention provide additional long-term value for the business. The Future of Barge Operations As we look toward the future, operational intelligence will become increasingly critical to success. The operators who embrace these technologies today will be best positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for efficient, sustainable freight transportation. BargeOS transforms how operators manage their assets, serve their customers, and compete in the modern logistics landscape. For operators ready to maximize their potential, a comprehensive solution is available today. Jason Aristides is CEO of OpenTug, the technology company behind BargeOS.

Dangers of the UK's Surrender of the Chagos Islands Begin to Crystallize,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dangers-of-the-uk-s-surrender-of-the-chagos-islands-begin-to-crystallize,,17/09/2025 00:43:52,,"The UK government’s plan to surrender sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius took a major step forward this week when the bill passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons, its primary legislative hurdle. The Bill now goes to the House of Lords, where there could be delays. But the most likely obstacle to the deal going through would be a change of heart in the United States – which will be the ultimate loser when the arrangements in the deal unwind and its true character emerges. The deal envisages continued US use of the Diego Garcia Naval Support Facility, but under a lease-back arrangement, once the UK has surrendered sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory. The deal was originally promoted in the UK by a group of progressive human rights lawyers (with Starmer a core member), who believed the UK’s national interest would best be served by giving primacy to international law. The mood in Britain has changed significantly since then, and Sir Kier Starmer’s involvement in forcing the deal has not helped his prospects. The Reform party, which leads in the UK polls, has promised to reverse the deal if it gets into office. A more realistic assessment is that the deal will be completed, and sovereignty will be transferred to Mauritius. However, even before completion, the dangers of the deal are becoming evident. The most likely adverse occurrence would be the Mauritian government exploiting its rights under the deal to obstruct American use of the base, thereby reducing its value as a strategic asset. The requirement to notify the Mauritius government of any impending attack on a third party, and the right of Mauritius to maintain a presence on Diego Garcia - able in effect to spy on American activity - are the most obvious levers which could be exploited. The Mauritian government and its opposition are far more aligned with Chinese and Indian interests than those of the United States and the United Kingdom. Once the deal is signed, these antagonisms will emerge. The deal has not bought the friendship or loyalty of Mauritius. Mauritius PM Navin Ramgoolam meets Chinese Ambassador Dr Huang Shifang, May 14 (Instagram) India, seen as a friend by the United States several months ago but last seen standing alongside Russia, China, Iran and North Korea at the recent military parade in Beijing, has already made an unsolicited offer to ‘help’ Mauritius patrol the Chagos Islands Maritime Protection Area. While greeting the deal as a victory for anti-colonialism, the Indian government has already in effect annexed the Mauritian islands of Agaléga to construct a military base, despite strong opposition from the island’s inhabitants. The Mauritian economy is tied closely to that of India, which has strong leverage over the island. If India does not use its muscle in favor of anti-American interests, the Chinese are waiting in the wings to do so. At a meeting on May 14, the Chinese Ambassador Dr Huang Shifang pledged to strengthen Mauritius-Chinese relation, particularly in light of the ‘strategic advantages’ which Mauritius enjoys, and that there would be ‘broad prospects for future collaboration’. The Mauritian Prime Minister has had close personal links with China since his father established China-Mauritian diplomatic ties in April 1972. Both China and Russia have welcomed the deal. The deal could also potentially collapse if a future United Kingdom not supportive of the surrender decided to renege on its payment schedule. The UK government is committed to paying Mauritius an annual rent of $220 million for each of the first three years, $160 million for the next ten years, and then $160 million rising with inflation thereafter. The deal was originally lifetime-costed in the House of Commons at $5 billion, a figure subsequently raised using government accounting protocols to $47 billion. Given the UK’s budget deficit, any future government might be tempted to stop paying the annual cost for the privilege of having surrendered the sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory in 2025. It is difficult to predict accurately what consequence will occur and when, but most of them threaten the United States’ continued use of the Diego Garcia Naval Support Facility - at best guess, within the next ten years. Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has recently described the UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell who negotiated the deal as “strategically an absolute fool”, adding his opinion that “Mauritius is a close ally of the Chinese Communist Party and not only will we lose Diego Garcia, but you will have Chinese power projection from Diego Garcia.”",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 09:30:48
Report: Ukraine's Port Strikes May Force Russia to Curtail Oil Output,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-ukraine-s-port-strikes-may-force-russia-to-curtail-oil-output,,16/09/2025 23:23:20,,"After a series of damaging attacks by Ukrainian drones, Russia's oil refining and export infrastructure may not have the capacity to handle - or even store - the full output of Russian oil wells, according to new reports. Transneft, the dominant Russian pipeline operator, has put limits on the quantity of storage that producers can use in its pipeline network, Reuters reports. The midstream operator has warned oil companies that if the damage continues and demand drops at the receiving end of the pipeline network, it may have to accept less crude, several industry insiders told the news agency. (Transneft vehemently denied the report and protested that this ""fake news"" could damage its image.) If true, hitting the limits of pipeline transit and storage capacity would mean that Russia would be forced to curtail production - meaning shutting-in wells, a process that can reduce a formation's ability to produce oil when restarted. A forced cut in pumping is among Ukraine's top strategic objectives, because Russia funds its ongoing war in large part with oil export revenue. The reported restrictions are a result of a concerted campaign of long-distance mass drone attacks. Ukraine has targeted Russia's largest refineries, and some have been hit repeatedly since the start of 2025. Drone operators hit at least 10 Russian refineries since the start of August alone. In recent weeks, Ukrainian intelligence services have broadened the scope of their target list to include Russia's two Baltic loading ports, Primorsk and Ust-Luga, causing limited damage at both facilities. The impact of any one strike is transitory, as Russian energy companies are capable of making repairs. But the cumulative effect has taken as much as 20 percent of Russia's refining infrastructure offline at a time, and the attacks continue at a rapid pace. Strikes on loading terminals have a multiplier effect: the terminals are a critical backup destination for barrels that have no domestic takers - and there are many such barrels because of the refinery attacks. The strike at Primorsk damaged two sanctioned tankers, the Cai Yun and the Kusto, as well as pumping equipment at the facility. Ukrainian analysts have estimated that the damage at Primorsk could reduce its loading capacity by half; it is not fully offline, however, and has already restarted at least some of its waterside operations at a slower pace. Russia produces nine percent of the world's crude oil, and the prospect of a slowdown could impact oil prices. So far the market is unperturbed: crude prices are up 3.5 percent over the past month, averaging about $68 rather than $66.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 09:30:48

Italian Court Approves Extradition of Suspect in Nord Stream Attack Case,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-court-approves-extradition-of-suspect-in-nord-stream-attack-case,,17/09/2025 02:25:22,,"A Ukrainian national who was arrested last month on charges of plotting the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline attack is one step closer to extradition. A court in Bologna, Italy has approved his extradition to Germany to stand trial, moving the process on to the appeals phase. In late August, Italian police have detained Ukrainian military veteran Serhii Kuznietsov in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. Kuznietsov had an outstanding warrant issued by German authorities, who suspect that he played a role in the complex attack on Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2. The 2022 subsea sabotage operation destroyed three out of four lines in the network, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history (and a serious impediment to any future restart of the Russian-controlled pipeline system). If extradited to stand trial, Kuznietsov faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion. Italy's extradition process takes time, but it is moving forward: on Tuesday, the Bologna district-level court ruled that he could be handed over to German authorities. He will appeal to a higher court, his lawyer told AFP. Kuznietsov denies any role in the attack, and has a three-part defense. First, he asserts that he was in Ukraine at the time of the blasts in September 2022. Second, his counsel points out that he was a member of the Ukrainian military during the period in question, which would grant him immunity. And third, he claims due process violations during the initial trial, including incomplete access to German prosecutors' files. German investigators have identified six suspects in the attack, and have issued a warrant for at least one of Kuznietsov's alleged co-conspirators. Denmark and Sweden, which also have jurisdiction over the sabotage attack, have both dropped their inquiries.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 15:42:01

Resources are being assembled to refloat the 21,359 dwt vessel, which is carrying a cargo of carbon block. The first salvage equipment, a salvage master, and a naval architect have reached the vessel, and a plan for refloating was submitted to the Canadian Coast Guard and Transport Canada, who said they are reviewing it. The cost of refloating the vessel and any remediation efforts undertaken by the Canadian Coast Guard will be the responsibility of the vessel’s owner. Additional salvage equipment and staff are expected to reach the ship later in the week. Royal Wagenborg, however, notes that the efforts are subject to the weather, which delayed some operations last weekend. The Canadian Coast Guard had dispatched its vessels CCGS Jean Goodwill and CCGS Sir Wilfrid Laurier to the site and used them to assist in transporting materials. Both vessels have been released, while CCGS Des Groseilliers is now on-scene to monitor and provide response support. Thamesborg, which is 565 feet (172 meters) in length, was transiting from Asia to Baie Comeau, Canada, when it grounded in the Franklin Strait off Prince of Wales Island, Canada, on September 6. Surveys have confirmed the damage is limited to several of the vessel’s ballast tanks, with no water ingress into the cargo holds or fuel tanks. Royal Wagenborg highlights that the vessel, which was built in 2012, was designed to meet Finnish/Swedish ice class 1A (IACS Polar Class 7), meaning it is suitable for summer and autumn operations in first-year ice. For the Arctic voyages, Royal Wagenborg said it hires external knowledge in the form of ice pilots, who are often former captains of icebreakers who are familiar with the local waters. They said the Canadian authorities “greatly appreciate that we strengthen our professional crew with extra local knowledge.” The company became the first European shipping company in 2016 to traverse the entire North West Passage without the assistance of icebreakers. The company highlighted that it has made several transits of the waters, including Thamesborg previously sailed from Canada to China on the North West Passage. Using this route, Royal Wagenborg reports is some 3,750 nautical miles shorter than sailing through the Panama Canal. It results in about 14 days less sailing time. They, however, acknowledged the challenges, noting the level of planning required and that ships encounter shallow water, islets, narrow waterways, strong currents in some passages, and routes close to the coast.

Croatia Invites Bid for Bankrupt 3 Maj Shipbuilder to Revive Industry,https://maritime-executive.com/article/croatia-invites-bid-for-bankrupt-3-maj-shipbuilder-to-revive-industry,,17/09/2025 15:41:20,,"The Croatian government is looking to revive its once-strong shipbuilding industry through a series of privatization efforts. After having stepped in to take control of the shipbuilders 3 Maj and Uljanik Brodogradiliste, the government’s Center for Restructuring and Sale (CERP) has opened bids for the 3 Maj yard located in Rijeka. Croatia’s once thriving shipbuilding industry succumbed to rising costs, competition from Asia, and the financial strain of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. The yards had been struggling before 3 Maj was forced into bankruptcy in April 2025. One of the creditors petitioned the courts, and the company filed for bankruptcy in mid-April with a receiver appointed in May. September 9 was set for a hearing and the deadline for submitting claims. The shipyard known as 3 Maj traces its origins to 1905. Its recent projects have included two luxury polar cruise ships for Australia’s Scenic Group. The company had been forced to set up its own subcontractor to manage the construction projects and to get the cruise ships completed due to the yard’s financial troubles. Among 3 Maj’s last commercial shipping projects were the construction of two 650-foot self-unloading dry bulk lake freighters for Canada’s Algoma Central Corporation. Scenic Group was reported to be exploring opportunities earlier this year to pursue additional cruise ships with the yard. The Croatian government stepped in January 2025 to take control of the yard through a debt-to-equity swap for $10.6 million. SeeNews reported at the time that the total claims against the shipyard amounted to more than $48 million and that the plan was to initiate a sale. CERP, in a filing dated September 17, is inviting public bids for 3 Maj. The minimum price to acquire 100 percent of the government’s shares is set at approximately $7.9 million. Bidders must pay a $2,400 document fee to enter the bidding and include a $79,000 bid guarantee with their entry. Bids must be submitted by November 17. Croatia looks to restart the shipbuilding industry and, as such, has placed a restriction on bidding, saying that the buyer has an obligation to maintain the company’s shipbuilding activities. The government also took control of another major shipbuilder, Uljanik Brodogradiliste, in March 2024, holding a 97 percent stake. That shipyard had also slipped into bankruptcy after its creditors unsuccessfully tried to sell their 55 percent stake in the company in 2023 and again in 2024. The government took over the yard to facilitate making payment of the past due wages to workers. SeeNews reported that the Croatian government also plans to privatize this yard before the end of 2025.",Maritime Executive,17/09/2025 21:28:42

Instead, the first ship will be constructed in Cadiz at Navantia's Spanish yard, a company representative told the Financial Times. ""We shuffled a little bit things for ship one into Spain, and we moved from Spain things for ships two and three,"" Navantia UK CEO Donato Martinez told the FT. ""The facilities were not ready in Belfast."" He emphasized that the overall program is still on track to deliver all three ships by 2032, as scheduled. The estimated current price is about $2.7 billion for the full program. Harland & Wolff is known best as the builder of the Titanic, and has delivered many prominent vessels over the course of its 164-year history. But in recent years it has had its challenges, like many European yards: it delivered its last vessel in 2009, and it has been insolvent twice since 2019. Navantia acquired the shipbuilder out of administration earlier this year for about $125 million, with support from the British government, which wants to see the FSS contract succeed. H&W and Navantia won the contract award jointly, before they became one company. As the yard's new owner, Navantia says that it is investing in its capabilities to improve productivity and modernize operations, including a new automated panel line and a robotic plasma cutter. The infrastructure project should be completed by June 2026, reports Navy Lookout. Even before the rescheduling, Navantia was planning to build the most complicated portions of the ship at Cadiz. But the effects of the rescheduling could be significant for H&W's outlying yards, which were planning to feed blocks to the Belfast facility for assembly. Steel cutting for the bow of the first ship was already scheduled for December 2025 at the H&W subsidiary yard in Appledore, the outlet reported. Work is already under way on a purpose-built barge to transport these blocks, and H&W and its outlying yards have already started hiring up apprentices.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16
New Zealand to Clarify Conflict Between Offshore Wind and Seabed Mining,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-to-clarify-conflict-between-offshore-wind-and-seabed-mining,,17/09/2025 22:21:04,,"The government of New Zealand reports that it will be taking steps to encourage the development of its offshore energy and natural resources. It plans to revise legislation to resolve potential conflicts between offshore wind energy development and seabed mining as a key step to permit both sectors to proceed. “New Zealand has some of the world’s greatest offshore wind potential, offering a significant opportunity to generate economic growth while powering our homes and businesses,"" said Energy Minister Simon Watts. “Offshore wind requires a significant upfront investment. That’s why we are establishing a clear regulatory regime through the Offshore Renewable Energy Bill that was introduced last year, to give developers the certainty they need to invest and kickstart the sector.” The industry has been calling for action by the government while the development of key projects has been stalled. BlueFloat Energy, which was seeking opportunities in New Zealand, reportedly wrote the ministers last year saying the country needed to choose between offshore wind and seabed mining. BlueFloat later pulled out of New Zealand. A partnership between Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and the government-owned NZ Super Fund, however, has an ambitious project saying it would commit approximately US$3 billion for a wind farm consisting of up to 70 wind turbines to be located 15 to 25 miles off the coast of South Taranaki, at the southwestern side of the North Island, and on the Tasman Sea. The company has set an initial goal of 1 GW while noting the project could be scaled to 2 GW. New Zealand’s cabinet has agreed to amend draft legislation. According to the minister, the changes will create greater investment certainty for both offshore wind and seabed mining. The reports said it would only impact seabed mining and not the oil and gas sector or existing mineral projects. “The amendments will enable the government to use secondary legislation to designate specific marine space where permits could be invited for offshore renewable projects while there is a pause on granting new permits for seabed mining under the Crown Minerals Act,” explained Watts. “This is a pragmatic step to address a key concern raised by the industry.” While the amendments and legislative steps will remove a key hurdle, New Zealand has not yet designated its first areas. Watts, however, said that it is likely to be somewhere in South Taranaki. The CIP-led partnership, known as Taranaki Offshore Partnership, reports it has already invested heavily in the project. It has undertaken wind measurements and surveys. It anticipates that the wind farm could be in the construction and commissioning phase by 2030. It anticipates it will take three to four years to complete.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16

The spot is both a roadside attraction and a hazard to the unwary, and not all who have gone in have survived. At about 1540 hours, the service got a call reporting a man who had fallen into the well and needed rescue. A helicopter aircrew out of North Bend was dispatched to the scene and assist - but when they arrived after 20 minutes of flight, the victim was no longer visible to responders on shore; he had already drowned and was face-down in the water. The helicopter's rescue diver, Tyler Gantt, was tasked with the mission of recovery, a difficult job that would be much more hazardous to attempt from the shore. But the job of lowering away into a sinkhole that has a constantly-fluctuating water level and crashing surf, with rock walls on each side, is hardly safe. Gantt told the Lincoln Chronicle that it was one of the most hazardous missions he'd taken in 10 years on the job. A post shared by Dillon Thompson (@dillon.thompson.5150) Thor's Well up close To give Gantt the best chance, the co-pilot watched the waves and called out a countdown to impact. Instead of dangling on the wire, Gantt stayed hooked up but climbed down the rock face, keeping him out of the rising and falling water (and away from the submerged caverns below). After many tries, he grabbed the body and was hoisted back to safety, he told the Chronicle. Gantt said that he couldn't recommend the well as an attraction to inspect at close range. ""Speaking as someone who’s been inside Thor’s Well, not very many people have been in it and lived. But speaking as someone who’s been in it – there’s nothing to see in there. It’s a hole in a rock,"" he told the outlet. ""The only cool thing about it to see is the waves coming out of the spout from a safe distance. That’s all I have to say about that.""",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16
Construction Update as Wind-Powered Cargo Trimaran Gets Biopharma Customer,https://maritime-executive.com/article/construction-update-as-wind-powered-cargo-trimaran-gets-biopharma-customer,,17/09/2025 21:50:00,,"Construction on what is being billed as the first of a fleet of wind-powered cargo trimaran vessels is proceeding as the French company Vela Transport reports it has booked a major biopharmaceutical client for the service. Last fall, the company reported it had raised the capital for the construction of its first vessel and expects to launch its transatlantic cargo service in late 2026. Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical has signed an agreement to become the first biopharmaceutical company to transport products on the new service. The company, which is focused on treatments including gastrointestinal and inflammation, rare diseases, plasma-derived therapies, oncology, neuroscience, and vaccines, highlights that it will use the wind-powered trimaran as part of its goals to incorporate net-zero into its value chain by 2040. Vela highlights that the vessel, which they are calling L'avion des Mers (The Airplane of the Seas), is purpose-built to handle pharmaceutical products. It will have a capacity for 500 US pallets (600 EUR pallets) aboard the 220-foot (65-meter) vessel. The cargo areas will feature a compliant refrigeration system that is temperature-controlled and powered by renewable energy generated onboard. The seven refrigerated holds meet pharmaceutical standards. The vessel is currently being built at Austal Philippines’ Balamban in Cebu, Philippines. The company recently highlighted that the two carbon-fiber masts are in the final stage of construction. Each will stand 171 feet (52 meters) and give the vessel a total sail area of 6,700 square feet. At sea, they anticipate a speed of 14 knots entirely from wind power. It will also have 2,583 square feet of solar panels. Vela plans to leverage offshore racing technologies, direct routes, and more efficient port operations through secondary ports to provide a fast cargo service. Voyages are project to take two weeks sailing between Normandy and Bordeaux in France and New Jersey, in the United States. Hull construction is also well underway. On June 30, Austal completed the turnover of the hull in its building hall. Approximately 30 percent of the key components for the vessel, including rigging, sails, and hydro-generators, are being supplied by French companies. The vessel is being built entirely of aluminum. They also report that to support sustainability, the vessel and its components are designed to be dismantled either for reuse or recycling. Vela highlights other unique features of the design. Using a trimaran, the ship will have inherent stability. They report that it is expected to be the only cargo sailing vessel that does not use water ballast. At sea, it will be 100 percent wind powered, and to meet maritime requirements, it will have an engine that will be primarily powered by electricity from batteries, solar, and hydrogeneration onboard for maneuvering in port. As a backup, it will also have marine diesel fuel, but they anticipated minimal use of the engine. The plan calls for a fleet of sailing cargo vessels. By 2028, the company plans to have five vessels to provide weekly sailing and transport up to 48,000 tons of goods per year.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16

Historical Association Finds Long-Sought Wreck of 19th-Century Schooner,https://maritime-executive.com/article/historical-association-finds-long-sought-wreck-of-19th-century-schooner,,17/09/2025 20:35:49,,"The prolific wreckfinders at the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association have unveiled another historic Great Lakes shipwreck. Over the weekend, the association announced that it has discovered the long-sought wreck of the F.J. King, which foundered in Lake Michigan in 1886. The F.J. King was a wooden cargo schooner built in 1867 for bulk trades on the Great Lakes. Her dimensions allowed her to transit the Welland Canal, expanding her opportunities for trading. On September 14, 1886, F.J. King was under way with a load of iron ore, headed for Chicago. Off the Door Peninsula, she was hit by a gale and seas of up to 10 feet. In the pounding, her wooden hull began to admit water. The crew pumped by hand in an attempt to keep her afloat, but within a few hours it became apparent that the ship would sink. The master ordered abandon ship, and all the crew got off safely. At about 0200 hours on the 15th, the schooner sank below bow-first; the survivors were rescued by another schooner and delivered safely to Baileys Harbor. There were no fatalities. The location of the wreck remained a mystery, and a point of local curiousity. The master's last reported position didn't line up with visual observations of the vessel's masts from the local lighthouse keeper. Clues and hints to the site's whereabouts showed up periodically - like bits of wreckage that came up in fishing nets - but decades of searching yielded nothing, even after a local club posted a healthy bounty. WUAA had a small search grid to run based on the lighthouse keeper's account, but didn't expect to find anything that day. They departed their pier on a trial run to familiarize themselves with a sidescan and a small ROV, and stumbled upon the wreck after two hours of operating. They measured its length on sonar and found it to be 140 feet - about the same as F.J. King. At this point they were pretty sure that they had it, and a quick ROV dive confirmed its identity and its remarkably intact condition. Composite photo of the wreck site (WUAA) “We reasoned that the captain may not have known where he was in the 2AM darkness, but the lighthouse keeper’s course and distance to the masts were probably accurate,"" said principal investigator Brendon Baillod. The wreck position was about half a mile from the lighthouse keeper's estimate. Great Lakes wreckfinding is an active area of archaeological pursuit, and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association has discovered four other wrecks in the last three years. A similar group in Michigan, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society, has found countless more. There are an estimated 1,500 shipwrecks in Lake Michigan alone.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16
Yang Ming Orders Containerships with New LNG Technology from Hanwha Ocean,https://maritime-executive.com/article/yang-ming-orders-containerships-with-new-lng-technology-from-hanwha-ocean,,17/09/2025 20:05:46,,"Taiwan’s Yang Ming Marine Transport is continuing to pursue its strategic fleet optimization plan, reporting the order of seven additional new vessels from Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, which will be the largest in its fleet and employ a new LNG technology. The carrier is also taking steps to position itself for the coming fuel transition, adding an ammonia-ready element to the design of the vessels. The container segment has continued overall to be the most aggressive, both with new orders and continuing the adoption of alternative fuels. DNV, presenting its annual industry forecast yesterday, noted that other segments, such as tankers, have been waiting for more clarity on the future regulations, but containerships lead both in LNG- and methanol-fueled vessels. Containership owners have over 200 LNG-fueled vessels in operation with another 355 currently on order, as well as 36 operating methanol-fueled vessels and a further 206 on order, DNV calculates. Overall, containership orders are at record levels. Yang Ming’s new order is valued at $1.4 billion for seven vessels, each with a capacity of 15,880 TEU. They are scheduled for delivery by the first half of 2029 and will be equipped with dual-fuel LNG engines and will also have an ammonia-ready notation by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for the design. The vessel will be the first equipped with a Type-B LNG fuel tank with a 1.0 bar design pressure. The tank design was developed by Hanwha Ocean and ABS, and according to the report, it enhances the safety and efficiency of LNG operations compared to the current 0.7 bar design. Hanwha highlights that the ships will be able to store vaporized LNG for a longer period, which will reduce unnecessary gas incineration. The ships will also comply with future shore-power regulations. For Yang Ming, it is the company’s second major order of LNG-fueled vessels, and ships above 15,000 TEU capacity. In 2023, the company ordered five 15,500 TEU containerships to be built by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries for delivery in 2026. The carrier is following a diversified future strategy as earlier this year it also ordered six 8,000 TEU methanol dual-fuel containerships to be built by Nihon Shipyard and Imabari Shipbuilding in Japan for delivery between 2028 and 2030. Founded in 1972, Yang Ming currently has a fleet of 101 containerships representing a total of 8.2 million dwt and a capacity of 727,000 TEU. Last year, it revealed a plan for fleet optimization that calls for ordering up to 13 vessels ranging between 8,000 and 15,000 TEU. It plans to replace 20-year-old and older vessels with a capacity of 5,500 to 6,500 TEU, while also preparing for the adoption of alternative fuels. This represents the first order from Yang Ming going to Hanwha Ocean, while the shipbuilder also emphasizes that it is part of a growing position in the Taiwanese market. Taiwan’s other large carrier, Evergreen, ordered seven containerships from Hanwha in March 2025. According to reports in the Korean media, Hanwha Ocean has booked a total of 30 vessel orders this year valued at $5.94 billion. It includes 13 containerships and 11 ultra-large crude oil tankers, as well as LNG carriers and Korea’s new icebreaker research vessel.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16

The second portion focuses on expanding capacity through new transport systems and the expansion of infrastructure. The Rio Indio Reservoir plan was developed in response to the drought, which limited operations in 2023 and 2024, as well as the long-term growth of the operation. The canal was forced to limit transits and reduce the maximum draft for vessels to preserve water during the drought. In addition to expanding water recycling, the next phase of the plan calls for the building of a new dam. The authority views it as a critical step, but the plan has received criticism in Panama due to the impact on the local communities. The projected cost of the new dam and lake is $1.6 billion, with work on the dam scheduled to start in 2027. The new reservoir would be completed by 2032, but it will displace over 2,500 residents. The authority highlights that the budget includes $400 million in compensation. The Interoceanic Energy Corridor is a cornerstone of the future business plan. It would be a 76-kilometer (47-mile) pipeline, making it possible to move 2.5 million barrels of energy products a day across Panama. Vessels would be able to transfer their cargoes from the Atlantic to the Pacific without having to make the transit. The plan calls for the construction of marine terminals on each side of the canal. They are continuing to discuss the products, but anticipate that liquefied petroleum gas, ethane, butane, and propane would be transferred through the pipeline. The goal is to rebuild LNG volumes, which fell dramatically in 2024. The Board of Directors has approved the pipeline plan. The process includes prequalification of companies, technical dialogues, and preparation of the final terms for the bidding. They expect to proceed with the tender in the second quarter of 2026. The authority is also moving forward with a pre-feasibility study for the proposed Corozal Port, which would be on the Atlantic side of the canal near Panama City. The authority has discussed plans for additional terminals as part of its expansion and to deflect some of the criticisms over the current terminals operated by the Chinese company Hutchison. They expect to proceed with the studies in 2026 and expect that construction for Corozal would begin in 2028. Longer-term plans also anticipate a new Pacific terminal and facilities for both containers and RoRo cargo. A new road is also planned to cross the isthmus. The planning comes as the canal has seen a rebound in volumes since the lifting of drought restrictions. The authority is projecting that the canal will have handled more than 500 million metric tons of cargo when the fiscal year ends on September 30. It will be up from the 423 million tons of cargo in FY 2024. Vessel traffic in the last two months has averaged just over 32 ships per day, up from a low of 24 during the restrictions, but below the current target of up to 36 transits per day. The canal is projected to have a gross income of approximately $5 billion in this fiscal year. Last month, Panama’s cabinet approved the new fiscal year budget projecting more than $5.2 billion in gross income, with the canal project to contribute nearly $3.2 billion to the national treasury, an increase of more than $400 million. The President of Panama, José Raúl Mulino, has repeatedly asserted the country’s sovereignty over the canal in response to the allegations from Donald Trump and the United States. They have rejected the claims that “China runs the canal” made by Donald Trump and have taken steps to further remove China’s influence, including challenging in court the concession granted to Hutchison. Talks regarding the sale of the terminals and Hutchison’s non-China port operations are reported to be continuing as they work to rebuild the deal to receive Chinese government approval.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16
Marine Archaeologists Salvage Artifacts From Titanic's Sister Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/marine-archaeologists-salvage-artifacts-from-titanic-s-sister-ship,,17/09/2025 18:50:55,,"Marine archaeologists in Greece have recovered artifacts from the wreck of the HMHS Britannic, a sister ship of the Titanic and the largest vessel lost during the First World War. Britannic was built at Harland & Wolff at the height of WWI and delivered in late 1915. While she had been ordered as a passenger ship, but she was immediately pressed into service as a hospital ship in Royal Navy service, requisitioned for transporting casualties of the costly and ultimately unsuccessful Gallipoli campaign. She made three voyages, including the evacuation of the Dardanelles in January 1916. After that, she was paid off and dispatched to Belfast for a refit as a passenger liner - but was immediately recalled to duty in the middle of the conversion and dispatched to the Mediterranean again for an additional two voyages as a hospital ship. Her design was modified to benefit from the safety lessons of the Titanic's sinking, including a double hull in way of the engineering compartments and raising up her watertight bulkheads another six decks. The revised design was intended to keep the vessel afloat with six compartments flooded. In the event of an abandon-ship scenario, she carried extra lifeboats and could in theory reposition them from one side to the other to enable full launch with a heavy list. But these changes were not enough to save her from meeting the same fate as Titanic. The Brittanic's career only lasted about 11 months in total: on the morning of November 21, 1916, she hit a German mine in the Kea Channel in the Cyclades. There were no patients on board, just the normal crew complement of 674 seafarers and 392 medical staff. Though only four compartments initially flooded, the ship listed and began downflooding through open portholes in lower-deck wards, which had been left ajar for ventilation. A failed watertight door between two boiler rooms added to the problem. The master navigated the vessel towards shore, hoping to effect an intentional grounding. During this evolution, two lifeboats were launched without authorization on the port side and were demolished by the exposed port propeller, killing 30 people. Ultimately the screws were stopped and the abandon-ship order given; 35 lifeboats made it away, and 1036 personnel survived. Brittanic lay on the bottom in shallow water, her position unknown until 1975, when she was rediscovered by Jacques Cousteau. This year, in May, a British team of archaeological divers revisited the site to conduct a recovery operation, with support from Greek authorities. Despite challenging site conditions, they resurfaced historical artifacts from the wreck, including ceramic tiles, cabin fittings, a navigation lamp, a bell, and a passenger's personal binoculars. All of the recovered items were taken to specialized underwater antiquities labs in Athens for proper treatment. The ultimate plan is to put them on display in Piraeus' new National Museum of Underwater Antiquities.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 04:27:16

Sperry Marine Paper Sets Out S-100 Step Change For Marine Navigation,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/sperry-marine-paper-sets-out-s-100-step-change-for-marine-navigation,,18/09/2025 01:38:14,,"[By: Sperry Marine] Sperry Marine, a global leader in navigation solutions for seagoing vessels, has issued a whitepaper to explain how new S-100 standards lay the foundation for enhancing the quantity, quality and appearance of the information navigators need to ensure vessel safety, efficiency and sustainability. ‘VisionMaster S-100 ECDIS - A step change for marine navigation’ explains how the new S-100 framework will help free electronic chart information systems (ECDIS) software from constraints embedded in existing standards that were conceived in the 1990s. The paper offers guidance to customers on S-100’s consequences for equipment procurement, crew training and in-service systems, while also introducing Sperry Marine’s VisionMaster S-100 ECDIS to market. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) has worked with industry to develop S-100 to replace existing S-52, S-57 and S-63 standards - respectively covering the way ECDIS show electronic navigation charts (ENCs), formats used for transferring hydrographic data, and cyber security verification. First phase developments focused on finalising S-100 standards for ENCs, bathymetric surface, water level information, surface currents, navigational warnings, and under keel clearance management. “The advent of S-100 represents the single biggest change to ECDIS since IMO adopted the revised ECDIS Performance Standards in 2006,” said Simon Cooke, Technical Manager, Sperry Marine. “This whitepaper offers practical guidance on how ships’ navigational and voyage management systems can realise the potential of accelerating digitalisation.” The contemporary geospatial standards (ISO 19100) used in S-100 allow multiple navigational data layers to be presented simultaneously on a single display, while S-100 standards are also extensible so that new data products can be added as required, said Cooke. The International Maritime Organization has revised its ECDIS performance standards to accommodate S-100. Users are free to use software conforming to the standard on a voluntary basis in new ECDIS installations from January 1, 2026, with their use scheduled to be mandatory for new ECDIS installations from January 1, 2029. As Sperry Marine’s insightful paper explains, however, manufacturers need type approval that S-100 ECDIS satisfies test standard IEC 61174 Edition 5, which the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has yet to finalise. IMO has also not set a deadline for updating existing ECDIS installations, with hydrographic offices continuing to publish S-57 ENCs for the foreseeable future. “Experience demonstrates that close collaboration is critical between regulators and marine technology specialists on ECDIS to ensure ship safety, efficiency, environmental responsibility, and orderly transition,” said Cooke. For good reason, Sperry Marine’s VisionMaster S-100 ECDIS will have ‘dual fuel’ compatibility with S-100 and S-57 standards, he added. The first-time user of the VisionMaster S-100 ECDIS would experience new generation benefits going beyond S-100 requirements, he added, for example by allowing the navigator to see charted dangers further along planned or current routes, and to set preferences to minimise distractions from alerts while maintaining awareness of significant charted objects. “But, as this white paper also shows, the IMO’s 2026 milestone for voluntary S-100 ECDIS adoption is an opportunity to acknowledge the benefits these standards will bring for industry as a whole. Sperry Marine is ready to work with its customers on the timely transition to S-100 for the better of ship safety, ship performance and maritime decarbonisation.” Download the white paper here.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 09:30:21
Amogy and KBR Sign MoU to Advance Ammonia-to-Hydrogen Solutions,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/amogy-and-kbr-sign-mou-to-advance-ammonia-to-hydrogen-solutions,,18/09/2025 01:33:44,,"[By: Amogy] ?Amogy, a provider of mature, scalable, and efficient ammonia-to-power solutions, today announced it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with KBR, a leading global provider of science, technology, and engineering solutions. The collaboration will focus on expanding pathways for global decarbonization through ammonia cracking and involve evaluating and advancing ammonia cracking catalyst applications to accelerate ammonia’s role as a hydrogen carrier. Under the agreement, Amogy’s proprietary Ruthenium ammonia cracking catalysts will be evaluated within KBR’s hydrogen production platforms for potential commercial deployment, including offshore and industrial applications. The collaboration also establishes regular knowledge exchange, joint exploration of new market opportunities, and cooperative efforts to demonstrate Amogy’s catalysts integrated into KBR’s systems. Amogy’s catalyst portfolio, including both precious-metal-based and base-metal-based formulations, enables highly efficient ammonia conversion into hydrogen. Designed for high activity, these catalysts increase hydrogen production rates at lower operating temperatures. Available through licensing or direct sales, they offer scalable, reliable solutions to meet the diverse demands of the clean energy sector. KBR, a global leader in sustainable energy solutions, offers technologies for both green and blue hydrogen production. Its portfolio includes H2KPlusTM for cost-effective blue hydrogen via Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and H2ACT® for producing hydrogen from ammonia. This collaboration complements KBR’s portfolio and aligns with KBR’s interest in evaluating innovative catalyst technologies for potential integration into its hydrogen platforms. “KBR’s leadership in hydrogen technology makes them an ideal partner as we work to scale ammonia’s role as a global hydrogen carrier,” said Seonghoon Woo, CEO of Amogy. “Together, we are committed to advancing the hydrogen economy with innovative solutions. By combining Amogy’s catalyst expertise with KBR’s world-class technology platforms, we can unlock new opportunities for clean, scalable energy.” Ammonia is increasingly recognized as a key enabler of the hydrogen economy because it offers a practical, energy-dense, and easily transportable form of hydrogen. Unlike pure hydrogen, which is challenging to store and move at scale due to its low volumetric density, ammonia can be shipped using existing global infrastructure. When cracked back into hydrogen, it provides a carbon-free fuel source that can power heavy industry, transportation, and energy generation. As demand for clean hydrogen grows worldwide, ammonia is positioned to play a pivotal role in bridging supply and demand across regions.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 09:30:21

Pentagon Innovation Office Wants Nonlethal Weapon to Stop Smuggling Boats,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pentagon-innovation-office-wants-nonlethal-weapon-to-stop-smuggling-boats,,18/09/2025 01:30:37,,"Following two drone strikes on suspected smuggling vessels and the elimination of 14 suspected smugglers off Venezuela, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has put out a solicitation for off-the-shelf ""non-kinetic"" options for stopping small smuggling craft closer to home - specifically without undue risk of fatalities. The solicitation calls for proposals for a ""show-stopper"" device that can stop small boats, like those used to smuggle drugs and immigrants across U.S. maritime borders. Most U.S.-bound border crossings happens shoreside on the southern border, with smaller maritime components off San Diego, Brownsville and Puerto Rico; citing a ""growing security challenge"" on the water, DIU is looking for nonlethal ways to stop the small craft that make maritime cross-border smuggling possible. ""These agile vessels, often operating in densely populated areas and under cover of darkness, require interdiction strategies that do not expose the suspect vessel’s operators, civilian bystanders, and law enforcement personnel conducting the interdiction to an undue level of risk,"" DIU said in a statement. The DIU's solicitation laid out an example of a typical interaction off Southern California. A U.S. Coast Guard patrol boat gives chase to a suspect vessel operating at high speed in U.S. territorial waters. As the Coast Guard closes in, the small craft swerves repeatedly to deter a boarding. Then, to escape capture, the suspect vessel’s operator tosses his phone into the water and turns back towards the maritime boundary with Mexico. At this point, USCG rules of engagement allow the use of force - but the Coast Guard boat crew assesses that the use of disabling fire would put others at risk, including the vessel's occupants. Without kinetic engagement, the smuggling boat gets away across the Mexican boundary line, and the USCG boat has to give up the chase. Had the USCG patrol boat been fitted with a ""nonlethal"" method of stopping the suspect vessel, it could have completed the interdiction, DIU suggested - without hurting the passengers aboard the smuggling craft. To fill this perceived gap, DIU wants to buy a ready-to-use solution for disabling one small watercraft (or its operator) through non-kinetic means, without significant collateral damage to people or property. As examples, DIU cited microwave weapons and electronic attack. The selected option must be capable of disabling one or more high-speed watercraft at a time, deployable on Coast Guard patrol boats as small as 25 feet, and usable up to sea state 3. The most prominent, technically mature system in this category is Epirus' Leonidas microwave air defense system, which has been adapted for maritime deployment as the Leonidas H20. In testing it has proven proficient at disabling outboard motors by taking out their electronics, at ""record ranges."" ""Anything with little computers in it and stuff, is susceptible to these persistent fields of energy,"" said Epirus CEO Andy Lowery, speaking to Defense News earlier this year. ""It kind of uses the water as a mirror, and so [we] can use the water to our advantage, that is it hits certain spots in even further distances by using reflections off the water."" The company already has a mini ""pod"" variant that is light enough to mount on a drone, along with a vehicle-mounted version that has been trialed on the Stryker platform.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 15:41:03

Report: HD Hyundai in Talks to Buy U.S. Shipyard,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-hd-hyundai-in-talks-to-buy-u-s-shipyard,,18/09/2025 16:36:32,,"South Korea’s largest shipbuilder is reportedly in discussions with “multiple companies” exploring the acquisition of a U.S. shipyard. It would follow the 2024 acquisition of Philly Shipyard by competitor Hanwha and HD Hyundai’s growth strategy, expanding its international operations. News of the potential acquisition of a U.S. shipyard came during an exclusive interview with a company executive by Reuters. They declined to name the companies involved in the talks or to reveal how advanced the discussions might have progressed. HD Hyundai cited the strong opportunities emerging in the United States as it anticipates the Trump administration will accelerate naval shipbuilding to catch up with the Chinese. U.S. naval shipbuilding is currently dominated by a few major companies, including HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries), General Dynamics, Fincantieri Marine, Austal, and others. U.S. law requires warships to be built at U.S. yards, although there is talk in the U.S. Congress to ease some restrictions so that the Korean yards might build some vessels. HD Hyundai, in addition to its commercial operations, is expanding its construction of naval vessels. The company this week christened the second ship of South Korea’s 8,200-ton Aegis destroyer program at its Ulsan shipyard. Hyundai has been adapting the designs and building Aegis destroyers since 2008. It has a technical cooperation agreement (MOU) with Huntington Ingalls for the Aegis class and has also built warships for export to the Philippines, New Zealand, and a new program for Peru. The U.S. is viewed as the best market opportunity, and HD Hyundai has said it plans to lead South Korea’s ""Make America Shipbuilding Great Again"" (MASGA) initiative. South Korea pledged to invest $150 million into U.S. shipbuilding during its trade negotiations with the United States. Among the challenges mentioned during the Reuters interview is a shortage of skilled American workers and high attrition rates. Reuters reports the company said it could take three to five years to train U.S. workers. Also, it raised U.S. immigration and visa policy based on the recent raid of the Hyundai Motor’s battery plant in Georgia, which saw 475 Korean workers detained and many forced to return to Korea. HD Hyundai would also require government approval to acquire a U.S. shipyard. HD Hyundai has been moving aggressively to expand its international operations as part of a plan that targets $2.2 billion in revenues by 2035 from building U.S. warships, reports Reuters. So far this year, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering has received orders for a total of 90 ships worth $12.21 billion USD, achieving nearly 68 percent of its annual order target of $18.05 billion. The company announced a new partnership with U.S.-based Edison Chouest Offshore in June 2025 that they said would focus on building containerships. It also formed a new partnership in India and has been rumored to be a bidder for a shipyard development project in Morocco. At the beginning of September, the company launched shipbuilding operations in the Philippines for commercial ships.",Maritime Executive,18/09/2025 21:30:08

Cruise Ship Transits the Suez Canal Bound for Saudi Arabia,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cruise-ship-transits-the-suez-canal-bound-for-saudi-arabia,,18/09/2025 23:52:20,,"The cruise ship Aroya, which was launched by the Cruise Saudi initiative, made what has become a rare transit of the Suez Canal for ships with passengers. Like all the other segments of the shipping industry, most cruise ships began diverting away from the Red Sea in 2024 and have yet to return due to the continuing security threat from the Houthis. The Suez Canal Authority highlighted that the 151,000 gross ton cruise ship made the transit on Wednesday, September 17, traveling from Istanbul with approximately 2,300 passengers and 1,500 crew aboard. It will be making a stop in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, before completing the cruise in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The cruise ship is scheduled to spend the first part of the winter season operating from Jeddah. In February 2026, it is scheduled to transit the Red Sea, passing Yemen, bound for Dubai. It will make the return trip in the spring of 2026 as it repositions back to the Mediterranean for summer cruises. The ship is registered in the Marshall Islands, but its association with the Saudis is well known, who are considered to be enemies by the Houthis. The ship had previously made the Suez Canal transit in December 2024 on its pre-maiden voyage delivery run from Germany, where it was refitted for Aroya Cruises before its maiden voyage, and again in June 2025 when it repositioned into the Mediterranean for the summer season. Built by Germany’s Meyer Werft, the cruise ship operated from 2017 till the financial collapse of Genting Hong Kong for its Dream Cruises as the World Dream. It cruised in Asia until it was laid up in March 2022. It was acquired by Cruise Saudi, which relaunched at the end of 2024 as a ship specifically designed for the Saudis and the Arab world. It has a capacity to carry over 3,300 passengers when full. The Suez Canal Authority highlighted the transit as part of its marketing efforts to restore vessel traffic. The Chairman and Managing Director of the Suez Canal Authority, Admiral Ossama Rabiee, highlighted the authority’s marketing efforts and toll reductions and incentives available for cruise ships. He said they have flexible marketing policies for cruise ships. The Suez Canal had been a popular point for the cruise industry, with Rabiee highlighting that 69 cruise ships made the transit between 2021 and 2024. He said approximately 38,000 passengers had transited the Suez Canal on these ships, and it provided approximately $15.8 million in revenue for the authority. Cruise ships, however, have continued to reposition to avoid the Red Sea dangers. Italy-based Costa Cruises announced in July that it was canceling its planned cruises from the Middle East scheduled for the winter of 2025-2026. MSC Cruises announced last week that it was canceling a planned 25-day cruise between Dubai and the UK, and it has also again rerouted its world cruise to travel around South Africa. MSC Euribia will be sailing without passengers from Germany to reposition to Dubai, where it is due to start cruising in November. Dubai had been a popular winter homeport for cruise ships, and most world cruises transited the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal Authority, however, remains optimistic that it will be able to rebuild the cruise segment of its operations.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Divers Confirm Identity of Long-Lost Trawler on Georges Bank,https://maritime-executive.com/article/divers-confirm-identity-of-long-lost-trawler-on-georges-bank,,18/09/2025 23:29:56,,"The private diving and artifact-recovery company Atlantic Wreck Salvage has discovered the wreck of the long-lost trawler Seiner, a large fishing vessel that went down off Nantucket in 1929. Seiner was a steam trawler delivered in 1921 and homeported out of New London, Connecticut. The 140-foot vessel departed on her final voyage on January 9, 1929, but disappeared after her normal noon report on January 18. The ship was never found, and a large-scale search and rescue effort turned up no sign of her crew of 21 men. It was believed that she went down in a storm on Georges Bank, which was (at the time) a bountiful fishing ground known for its cod and haddock stocks. In 2022, Atlantic Wreck Salvage's vessel Tenacious visited Georges Bank to conduct a sidescan sonar search for historic wreck sites. They found Seiner, though they did not yet know it for certain, and they had to return to shore before they had time to dive on the site. Tenacious and her crew returned to Georges Bank in July 2025 to resume their work. They carried out a dive inspection of the Seiner wreck on July 27-28, and from visible characteristics, it was possible to verify the wreck's identity. “The team was able to identify Seiner from features such as the double drum trawl winch, remains of the raised forecastle deck, shape of the stern, and the presence of a steam engine and boiler,” said AWS' Captain Eric Takakjian in a release. Sadly, the company's founder and the skipper of Tenacious, Capt. Joe Mazraani, died on July 29 while identifying another wreck on Georges Bank. Mazraani's partner, criminal defense attorney and diver Jennifer Sellitti, continues to operate Tenacious as AWS' managing member.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Study Supports Growing Case for Long-Term Use of Biofuel Blends,https://maritime-executive.com/article/study-supports-growing-case-for-long-term-use-of-biofuel-blends,,18/09/2025 22:23:25,,"The maritime industry has undertaken a range of tests exploring the use of biofuels, blending fats with diesel to create a more environmentally friendly transition fuel, with the latest test confirming the long-term operational feasibility of biodiesel. The results conducted using an NYK car and truck carrier (PCTC) further confirm the viability of the fuel. DNV highlights the potential for biofuels in its new Maritime Outlook report. While it acknowledges the challenges over future availability, DNV notes that biofuel is easy to use. Its case study also showed that biofuel would be more economical for operators than paying the proposed penalties in the pending IMO regulations. The Singapore-based Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation released the report for its Project LOTUS (Long-term impact of continuous use of biofuels on vessel operations) study. Launched in May 2024, it was a six-month trial to assess the impact of continuous use of a B24 blend, comprising 24 percent fatty acid methyl ester (FAME or biodiesel) with very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO). The focus of the study was on engine performance and operations of the fuel oil delivery systems. According to GCMD, until now, the impacts of long-term use of biodiesel on main and generator engines, fuel storage and supply systems, and other shipboard components have not been comprehensively evaluated. Additionally, operational protocols for fuel conditioning, onboard storage, and comprehensive inspection checklists remain limited. Project LOTUS was designed to address those gaps by implementing a structured monitoring approach to track fuel and lubricant quality at key sampling points across these systems, and inspect engine and fuel system components throughout the trial. The report highlights that the continuous use of the fuel blend had no adverse impact on engine performance or the operation of the fuel oil delivery system. Further, the project developed a structured monitoring framework tailored for continuous biodiesel use. “Project LOTUS grounds the conversation around the extended use of biofuels in evidence,” said Professor Lynn Loo, CEO of GCMD. “Our findings show that they can be deployed safely and reliably, providing a concrete pathway for shipping’s decarbonization.” As part of the project, they tested 94 fuel and lubricating oil samples, along with conducting detailed engine inspections and measurements during the vessel’s dry dock overhaul. At the conclusion of the six-month study, the main engine on the NYK car carrier had operated for 2,888 hours and the auxiliary engine for 1,813 hours. GCMD reports the engines performed comparably to when they operated in VLSFO. Key observations confirmed no excessive sludge in fuel injection valves, no scratches in fuel injection pump plungers, and no liner or piston wear beyond original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications. Scavenge drain and engine oil analyses also showed no excessive wear elements. Another key concern, the impact of prolonged biodiesel storage, was tested with the report showing that the fuel quality remained within ISO 8217 specifications. They did find that the acid value of B24 blends increased 2.5-fold after six months of storage, but no microbial growth was observed in fuel samples. OEMs also confirmed engine and hardware compatibility with long-term B24 use, with no significant impact on operational costs, provided appropriate maintenance and handling practices are followed. Further, they conducted interviews with other vessel operators using biodiesel and found similar results. Further, the report notes that while OEMs and classification societies take an abundance-of-caution stance, the vessel operators surveyed have adopted a more pragmatic, risk-based strategy to adopting biodiesel blends by adapting existing standard operating procedures for VLSFO with recommended technical guidance where practicable. The report concludes that this suggests that when operators carry out appropriate operations in line with such guidance, biodiesel use does not present major issues.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Real-Time Engine Oil Quality Monitoring is Now in Reach,https://maritime-executive.com/article/real-time-engine-oil-quality-monitoring-is-now-in-reach,,18/09/2025 21:24:20,,"Lube oil contamination is one of the fastest ways to get into trouble in the engine room, and engineers monitor their oil closely for signs of problems. But it's hard to catch everything without a lab on board - at least, until recently. Castrol has come up with a new solution, SmartMonitor, that regularly checks the oil's properties and lets the crew (and shore staff) know about any developing issues. To find out more, TME caught up with Castrol Technical Service Manager, Are Sletten, who has been working with the product throughout early trials. Just for background, what's the standard process for analyzing engine oil? What happens normally on board the vessel is that an engineer takes a physical oil sample in a bottle and repeats the process once every three months. They will ship it to the laboratory. It takes two to three weeks before you get a reply, because it takes time for shipping and there is processing time at the lab. And then it will be checked and the results will be sent. How does Castrol's new equipment do it differently? The SmartMonitor unit will give you the same information as a lab report, but every hour. It will automatically take a sample from the main engine, run it through the unit, and then drain it back into the engine. SmartMonitor will give you the total base number, viscosity, oxidation, and water content, when used in an engine application. There is a display on the unit that the engineer can have a look at to see if everything is okay, but the unit also feeds data up to the cloud, and then the customers on shore can go into our website and view the results. They have access to the graphs, the trends, the alarm limits, and all of that. So, if you want to go back and see if something happened last week, you could go back and see the trend. What can this help prevent? How does it save the operator money? It's sort of like insurance: you might not need it, but in the event you do, then it will more than pay for itself. First, if you detect any water early, that's very valuable because of the damage that water ingress can do to an engine. The second most important factor is viscosity, especially when customers are considering new fuels. Fuel oil is always affecting the lube oil in the engine. In this time when people are testing biofuels, ammonia and methanol, having this on board is a valuable way to make sure that the fuel is not causing problems. For example, if there is a little bit of methanol fuel getting into the engine oil, the viscosity will go down, and then you lose your lubrication. If you lose the lubrication film, you might end up with bearing damage. This unit will tell you instantly if viscosity is going down and of course it has a low-level alarm to alert the engineers. At the same time, company managers on shore can get the alert via email or on the phone as a text message. Even if you're not paying attention, it's watching the engine every hour. It's a huge help for inexperienced engineers, and it takes a bit of stress off for senior engineers as well. Do you have any early success stories? We have done trials for several years and we have prevented engine damage. With one customer, the unit gave an alert that there was water in the engine oil. The engineers thought it was a faulty sensor and believed the unit was wrong, but we asked them to check anyways. They found that there was water in the oil, and because our SmartMonitor caught it early, they were able to fix the problem at lower cost. The customer then bought several more of our SmartMonitor units for their other vessels.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Former U.S. Navy Admiral Gets Six Years for Influence-for-Hire Scheme,https://maritime-executive.com/article/former-u-s-navy-admiral-gets-six-years-for-influence-for-hire-scheme,,18/09/2025 20:35:42,,"Adm. Robert Burke (USN, ret'd.) has been sentenced to six years in federal prison for making a deal to trade his influence in the Pentagon for a lucrative post-retirement job. As a four-star admiral, Burke is among the highest-ranking officers ever convicted of a federal crime. “Today’s sentence sends a clear message: if you sell your honor and trade your influence, you’ll pay the price,"" said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro in a statement. ""Instead of leading by example, [Burke] cashed in that trust — turning four stars into dollar signs and trading duty for a corporate payday."" While it is commonplace for admirals to take positions with defense contractors after leaving the military, prosecutors alleged that Burke arranged a six-figure military contract for his future employer before he departed the service. The story began in 2018, when training firm Next Jump received a subcontract from the Navy for a pilot program. The Navy terminated it the following year, leaving Next Jump without any military contracts. Next Jump's co-chief executives, defendants Yongchul ""Charlie"" Kim and Meghan Messenger, emailed Adm. Burke - the vice chief of naval operations - in hopes of reestablishing the business relationship. That outreach did not yield results for Next Jump right away, but in 2021 Burke agreed to take Kim's call. At the time, Burke was Commander Naval Forces Europe and Africa. Kim allegedly laid out a job proposal for Burke. If the admiral secured a workforce training contract for Next Jump from Naval Forces Europe, and stayed in the Navy six months afterwards to promote the training service-wide, he would get a $500,000 per year post-retirement job at Next Jump, prosecutors said. That sequence of events unfolded as allegedly discussed: Next Jump delivered trainings in Naples and Rota, and Burke went to work for the firm in late 2022 at a comparable pay rate. Burke's defense lawyer, Tim Parlatore - a Navy Reserve JAG officer with a top-level Pentagon role - argued that the military and government investigation into Burke's case had been done incompetently. However, a jury convicted Burke in May; Kim and Messenger's case went to trial in August, but ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. According to Parlatore, Burke may have had a better chance at his trial if his jury had seen the same evidence allowed in Kim and Messenger's case. Federal prosecutors asked for a 10-year sentence for Burke after his conviction. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden sentenced him to six years in prison, plus three years of supervised release.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
"MAIB Cites Mechanical Failures, Modifications, and Crew Response to Fire",https://maritime-executive.com/article/maib-cites-mechanical-failures-modifications-and-crew-response-to-fire,,18/09/2025 20:07:31,,"The UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch issued a report on a 2021 fire aboard a RoRo cargo ship as it was departing the Port of Hull, England. It found a broad series of mechanical failures, improper parts used in non-standard modifications, and a failure by the crew to “follow accepted procedures,” which contributed to the significant damage to the vessel’s auxiliary engine room. However, there was no loss of life, and the vessel was recovered and moved back to the dock despite these issues. The cargo RoRo Finnmaster (8,800 dwt) was built in 1998 and operated on a regular route between Hull and Helsinki, Finland, for Finnlines, carrying RoRo and containerized cargo. The ship had a crew of 16 aboard and was making its normal departure from Hull when, eight minutes after leaving the dock on September 19, 2021, smoke alarms sounded and a fire was discovered in the auxiliary engine room. The ship was still within the confines of the harbor and, within four minutes, lost all main electrical power and propulsion, leaving it drifting while the crew struggled to put out the fire. Eleven minutes after the Finnmaster had left the dock, the first of two tugs was alongside, followed by a second one in an additional 11 minutes. They had the ship back alongside a dock approximately 50 minutes after it had cast off. The crew had finally been able to extinguish the fire through a combination of the CO2 system and entering the space with dry powder extinguishers. (MAIB report) MAIB found in its investigation that the fire started when one of the auxiliary engines malfunctioned, causing hot exhaust gas to impinge on a flexible hose, which then failed and leaked fuel under pressure onto a hot component. They concluded that the hose had been installed in the fuel system during a modification that “did not meet the required standard” and that it was fitted “in an inappropriate position.” The class society, RINA, had not had oversight or approval for the modification. Once the fire started, other mechanical failures resulted as they sought to respond to the growing emergency. The emergency generator’s circuit breaker malfunctioned, so it could not be connected to the power supply. The CO2 fire-extinguishing system failed to fully operate due to a defective flexible hose assembly and leaks in the pilot system. The ultrahigh-frequency handheld radio system being used by the engineers failed, cutting off communication to the master on the bridge. The 167-page report also highlights actions by the crew who attempted to enter the auxiliary engine room with dry powder extinguishers but were forced out by the heat. Some crew remained at their operational stations, and some went to emergency muster stations. The electrician attempted to restore power, but the crew was working with flashlights. Some of them attempted to re-enter the auxiliary engine room when they discovered not all the CO2 bottles had activated. They reported remnants of a small fire and, wearing compressed air breathing apparatus, re-entered and extinguished the fire with a dry powder extinguisher. The report says the crew’s response, affected by the loss of critical safety systems, was “ineffective.” MAIB made a total of 12 recommendations, split between the Finnish administration as the ship’s flag state, the owners Finnlines, and RINA, the responsible class society. They called for IMO amendments and guidance on the testing of emergency power and radio systems, as well as fire-extinguishing systems. To the shipping company, they recommended revised and updated training, response, and defect reporting procedures. They recommended that RINA make a recommendation to the International Association of Classification Societies for an urgent review into the procedural requirements for service supplies conducting maintenance of fire protection systems, and the guidance on support provided to chief engineers. The vessel sustained significant damage to equipment in the auxiliary engine room. The heat from the fire melted plastic components and damaged wiring. Smoke damage, however, was limited largely to the compartment. The ship was repaired but from to Grimaldi the following year. It continues in service managed since 2024 by Balearia.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Iranian Oil Exports to China are Back on the Rise,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/iranian-oil-exports-to-china-are-back-on-the-rise,,18/09/2025 19:01:17,,"After a period from March to May in which Iranian exports of crude oil to China fell substantially, in the three months from June to August sales have resumed their upward trend. According to Kpler, Chinese ports unloaded 1.68 million barrels per day in August, an increase of more than 20% over offloading in July. The August figure was well above the average of 1.45 million bpd for the first eight months of 2025. While monthly figures can be erratic, Iranian sales to China appear to be on an upward trend. However, this may not be translating into increased revenues for Iran, as market prices for crude have fallen with supply still expanding faster than demand, despite Russia’s export difficulties. Iran is having to offer discounts of about $5 per barrel in order to tempt the Chinese purchasers to ignore the potential risks of US sanctions. Iranian crude exports to China from Kpler and Vortexa estimates (CJRC) The increase in crude shipments comes notwithstanding a substantial increase in sanctions listings, both of ships, shipping agents and offload crude terminals in China, from the US authorities but also from the EU and UK. The brutal fact however is that sanctions on the Iran to China shipping operation are largely ineffective when all elements of the supply chain are either Iranian-owned, or owned by Chinese companies who can happily carry on business because they operate within China’s internal market, or enjoy the blessing of the Chinese government. Sanctions discourage the involvement of legitimate companies in the trade, but there are sufficient numbers of unscrupulous operators attracted by the heightened profit margins to keep the operation in train. Fictitious companies and registrations may be detected and such entities sanctioned, but by that point the beneficial owners will have long since shuttered whatever has been sanctioned, and got out the paint pot to put a new name on a successor company. Indeed, it could fairly be said that many of the government sanctions programs are political window-dressing, with no realistic prospect of being effective - save in deterring legitimate operators from taking part in the trade, to the benefit of cowboy operators instead. Winning the prize for ineffectiveness is the UK program, which despite listing hundreds of entities has failed to impose any penalty this year (or since records began) for breach of Iranian sanctions, though it has levied fines of $1 million for breaches of Russian-related sanctions. The news is not entirely bleak, however. Attacking the supply chain directly is likely to remain ineffective, at least until consideration is given to resuming seizures of ships and cargos at sea, as last occurred in 2023. But linking breaches of sanctions to imposition of tariffs could encourage governments to go along with the sanctions - except that leaders of most of the countries concerned stood alongside each other in solidarity at the recent military parade in Beijing to celebrate the end of the Second World War in Asia.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Connecticut and Rhode Island Seek Injunction to Restart Revolution Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/connecticut-and-rhode-island-seek-injunction-to-restart-revolution-wind,,18/09/2025 18:47:23,,"The attorneys general from Connecticut and Rhode Island asked a court on Wednesday for a preliminary injunction against the stop work order imposed on Ørsted’s Revolution Wind offshore wind project. They called the actions by the Trump administration “abrupt and arbitrary,” saying that the states would face “immediate and irreparable harm” if the work did not resume immediately. Nearly two weeks ago, the states also filed suit in Rhode Island against the stop work order, which was issued on August 22. Their actions are in addition to a suit filed in Washington, D.C. by the project developers. The states are arguing for a preliminary injunction while the legal cases are resolved. They highlight that work has now been stopped for nearly a month on a project that is 80 percent complete. The target date for completion of the project was November 2026. A project engineer for Ørsted, however, has said that if the delays continue, completion would be delayed at least till January 2027. The states highlight that Revolution Wind has contracts and obligations to the utility companies in Rhode Island and Connecticut. They said the first deadline is December 31, 2026. “We have no time to waste in getting Revolution Wind back online, which is why we’re asking the Court to put a stop to this in short order,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha. He highlights union workers who have been sidelined, as well as saying that companies are now reluctant to pursue economic ventures due to the uncertainty created by the stop work order. He also cites rising and increasingly unstable energy costs. Connecticut Attorney General Tong also said the “nonsensical stop work order” is causing both immediate and irreparable economic and environmental harm to Connecticut. “Every day that Revolution Wind sits mothballed in the ocean is another day of unemployment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when clean, affordable, American-made energy is within our sights,” said Tong. Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee reports that he wrote to the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum on September 3 to outline the status of the project and issues for the states. He requested a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump to negotiate a resolution. The governor said he does not think the administration “fully understands the consequences of what they are doing here.” He has not received a response to the meeting request. The U.S. Department of Justice, on September 16, made its first court filing responding to the legal challenges to the stop work order. It contends that the project “failed to reach an agreement with the Defense Department on measures to mitigate impacts from electromagnetic emissions and fiber-optic sensors.” A report in the Rhode Island Current newspaper highlights that the project received its final federal approvals in November 2023 after years of federal review. However, it was given an extension and a further delay till July 2025 to submit a plan for minimizing interference with federal marine fisheries surveys. It was also working with the Department of Defense on a 2024 agreement to deconflict the project with national defense interests. However, they were not required to submit additional documents to DoD, and it is pointed out that DoD in 2020 had no objections to the project. After imposing the stop work order, the administration has said it would also seek to challenge other permits issued during the Biden administration. It has filed court challenges to Maryland’s first offshore wind farm and a planned future project for Massachusetts. It permitted New York’s Empire Wind to restart after stopping work for a month in April, leaving Revolution Wind as the only largely installed (or operational) offshore wind farm that the administration is challenging.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Saudi Arabia and UK Lead Effort to Revitalize Yemen's Coast Guard,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saudi-arabia-and-uk-lead-effort-to-revitalize-yemen-s-coast-guard,,18/09/2025 18:36:33,,"Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have launched an international partnership to revitalize the Yemeni Coastguard, with the aim of improving security in the Red Sea and Bab el Mandeb. At a conference held in Riyadh attended by 35 countries, the Yemen Maritime Security Partnership was established to provide funding training equipment and support for Yemen’s Coastguard. The initiative is to be supported by a permanent secretariat, the Technical Assistance Fund For Yemen (TAFFY). Saudi Arabia is putting forward $4 million immediately as seed funding, and the UK with assistance from the Welsh government is to provide technical assistance and support for TAFFY during the implementation phase. TAFFY also has ambitions to take on wider government capability-building tasks. The UK had announced a package of support for the Yemeni Coastguard in November last year, comprised of fast patrol boats, training, and assistance. The UK has had a long-term interest in nurturing the Yemeni Coastguard since it was founded in 2003, having provided assistance in building its information and communications structure before the organization crumpled as the civil war in Yemen worsened. A cadre of 30 coastguard officers are currently undergoing a two-year English language training course sponsored by the British Embassy in Yemen. The 35 Countries who attended the conference included Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States, as well as GCC nations and the European Union. A significant conference attendee was Oman, who in the past has mediated the release of sailors held hostage by the Houthis. The breadth of participation suggests the forum could develop utility in solving broader issues of security in the Red Sea. In June last year, Major General Tariq Saleh held discussions with the chief of the Coast Guard Service, Major General Khaled Al-Qamali on how to improve cooperation. The General’s National Resistance Forces have made several high-value interceptions of inbound Houthi arms in the Red Sea. The effort to nurture the effectiveness of the Yemeni Coastguard and to develop a homegrown solution is in part an acknowledgement of the difficulties of providing protection for merchant shipping in the Red Sea and Bab el Mandeb using conventional naval forces. Although the separate EU and US led naval forces have had some success when deployed in areas under attack, it has proven impossible to provide sufficient coverage to protect all merchant shipping - and also extremely expensive. The success of the National Resistance Forces in making interceptions at sea is an encouragement to adopt non-military approaches to policing the problem, employing small craft, local knowledge and intelligence.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56
Historic Great Lakes Ferry Collides with Sister Ship in Docking Accident,https://maritime-executive.com/article/historic-great-lakes-ferry-collides-with-sister-ship-in-docking-accident,,18/09/2025 17:40:14,,"An accident that occurred during the routine docking procedure on Wednesday evening, September 17, for the Great Lakes ferry S.S. Badger. It was the second incident in two years for the historic ship, and despite some damage to the vessel, it was able to resume its sailings during the final weeks of the popular tourist season. At approximately 6:50 p.m. local time on Wednesday, the Great Lakes passenger-car ferry was backing into its dock in Ludington, Michigan. The vessel appeared to overshoot and collided with its long-retired, permanently moored sister ship, S.S. Spartan. None of the passengers aboard the four-hour cruise was injured. The Lake Michigan Carferry company wrote in a social media posting, “The incident, which occurred during a docking procedure... The extent of the damage to the S.S. Badger's sea gate is currently being assessed by marine engineers to determine the necessary repairs and to ensure the vessel's continued safe operation.” Despite the accident, the company reported that Badger would resume service between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on Thursday at 9 a.m. The summer sailing season had begun in May, and the ship is scheduled to conclude its yearly program on October 12. The vessel has a lift gate on its stern for the ramp to the car deck. It is unclear how much damage occurred to the gate, which appears to have been in the raised position as they were maneuvering into the dock. The Badger has a capacity to accommodate 600 passengers and 180 vehicles. The sea gate is visible in the raised position on this photo (Lake Michigan Carferry Co.) A local fan of the vessel, Travis May, commented on Facebook, “Spartan is roughly 40 yards behind the Badger’s dog they inch into with an anchor drag. Unless a guy in the firehouse went rogue, it’s impossible to hit that ship unless the anchor snapped late during the swing with heavy reverse power all of a sudden without anchor drag. Even then, it would be hard to hit the parked vessel as a turn in engines could reverse course in 40+ yards. On a clear night. This is really odd to me.” Two years ago, in July 2023, Badger backed into the ramping system, which is used to load and unload vehicles in Ludington. It was blamed on a mechanical failure, and the company tried to repair the loading ramp. In August, however, they announced that the season was suspended despite special celebrations to mark the vessel’s 70 years of service. Operated by Lake Michigan Carferry, the Badger and Spartan were launched in 1952 and 1953. At 410 feet (125 meters) in length, they were the largest and became the last coal-fired, steam engine car ferries built in the U.S. They were originally designed to provide a shortcut across Lake Michigan, a service maintained by the C&O Railroad till 1979. Spartan has not sailed since 1980 and today is used for spare parts for her sister ship. Badger became a popular tourist attraction, and in 2016, she was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The company and the vessels were acquired in 2021 by the Interlake Holding Company, which pledged to maintain the historic service. Originally designed primarily to transport railroad cars, today the Badger transports RVs, motorcycles, motor coaches, and commercial trucks on the 60-mile crossing of the lake.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 04:37:56

Dutch Expand Emission-Free Inland Shipping with Swappable Battery Packs,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dutch-expand-emission-free-inland-shipping-with-swappable-battery-packs,,19/09/2025 00:32:35,,"Zero Emission Services (ZES), working in collaboration with Nefcargo and Inland Terminals Group, highlighted the launch of its ZES 2.0 service for electric-powered inland cargo shipping. The next phase of the program provides more powerful containerized batteries for the inland ships, which will provide a more economical model for the industry. The 2.0 Zespacks are swappable battery containers. The company rolled out swapping stations on September 17 at Alphen aan den Rijn, Alblasserdam, and Den Bosch in the Netherlands. It reports that more terminals will soon follow in Rotterdam, Moerdijk, and Nijmegen, with the goal of establishing a robust network that makes battery-electric inland shipping more accessible. The vessels swap the batteries instead of having to wait longer periods to recharge their power systems. It expedites shipping. They also only pay for the power used, which ZES says makes battery-electric sailing financially more attractive. A subsidy scheme is also available for shipowners converting to battery power. The first vessel to adopt the exchangeable battery containers is the Den Bosch Max Groen. It was built by Concordia Damen and delivered in January 2021 as the second of two electric-powered inland cargo ships. Both vessels are 90 meters long and 11.5 meters wide (approximately 295 x 38 feet), with the shipbuilder highlighting that the dimensions are the maximum required to pass through the locks of the Dieze Canal at Engelen. Using an innovative design, they were able to give each vessel a capacity of 132 TEU, which is 24 more TEUs than the previous inland vessels. The first phase of the battery-powered shipping was launched as a partnership to transport cargo for the beer company Heineken. Nedcargo transports approximately 2.5 billion bottles of Heineken beer annually to the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. The battery-powered operation cuts CO2 emissions by 800 tonnes per year. The vessel will be operating between Den Bosch and the Port of Rotterdam. The trip is approximately 60 miles in each direction. ITG highlights that the new battery operation is part of its broader scheme to transition. Eduard Backer, CEO of ITG, explains, “Alongside this battery-electric vessel, our group also operates a hydrogen-powered ship. Hydrogen is suited to longer distances, while battery containers are ideal for shorter shuttle services. Waterborne transport is the path to a lower footprint. And with the upcoming CO2 levy (ETS-2), this will also bring financial benefits for shippers.”",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 09:30:21

On Thursday, a group of large shipowners announced that they would like to see changes in the deal and have ""grave concerns"" about the current text. Signatories include Bahri, Frontline, Capital Group, TMS, Dynagas, Gaslog, Hanwha Shipping, Angelicoussis Group and Stolt Tankers, among others. ""As it stands, we do not believe the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonizing the maritime industry,"" the owners told Reuters in a joint statement, adding that ""realistic"" adjustment was needed before adoption should be considered. Separately, DNV has suggested a rethink of the deal's terms for LNG, currently the shipping industry's most popular alternative fuel choice. The availability of true zero-carbon fuel is low, and DNV forecasts that the production projects to make it are likely to face headwinds for some time. Citing ""pragmatism,"" DNV CEO Knut Orbeck-Nilssen has advocated for a more accepting view of LNG within IMO's net-zero framework. On the other side of the Atlantic, ABS has advocated for a full ""timeout"" to think through the details of the net-zero framework. Chairman and CEO Christopher J. Wiernicki recently advised that ""achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard."" While the deal has its skeptics, the Getting to Zero Coalition - Maersk, NYK, Fincantieri, Gard, CMB.Tech, BV and LR, among many others - has urged IMO to pass it as written. ""Every year that action is delayed will compound into further delays down the road, as existing projects are scrapped and the planning cycle must begin anew. The absence of global regulatory guidance will raise the costs of change in the long run—costs that the industry, countries, and consumers will bear,"" the Coalition wrote. But the overall policy environment has also changed since IMO took the first step down road to carbon regulation nine years ago. Carbon reduction measures have fallen into disfavor in Washington, and face headwinds in Europe as well. France - once a stalwart proponent of climate action, and a key backer of the Paris Agreement - is now quietly pushing to slow down formalization of Europe's 2040 climate goals, Politico reports. A key vote on 2040 targets was scheduled for September 18, but was canceled last week after demands for a delay from France and Germany - the opposite of what might have been expected in years past.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 15:41:45
Former U.S. Navy Admiral Gets Six Years for Influence-for-Hire Scheme,https://maritime-executive.com/article/former-u-s-navy-admiral-gets-six-years-for-influence-for-hire-scheme-2,,18/09/2025 16:02:58,,"Adm. Robert Burke (USN, ret'd.) has been sentenced to six years in federal prison for making a deal to trade his influence in the Pentagon for a lucrative post-retirement job. As a four-star admiral, Burke is among the highest-ranking officers ever convicted of a federal crime. “Today’s sentence sends a clear message: if you sell your honor and trade your influence, you’ll pay the price,"" said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro in a statement. ""Instead of leading by example, [Burke] cashed in that trust — turning four stars into dollar signs and trading duty for a corporate payday."" While it is commonplace for admirals to take positions with defense contractors after leaving the military, prosecutors alleged that Burke arranged a six-figure military contract for his future employer before he departed the service. The story began in 2018, when training firm Next Jump received a subcontract from the Navy for a pilot program. The Navy terminated it the following year, leaving Next Jump without any military contracts. Next Jump's co-chief executives, defendants Yongchul ""Charlie"" Kim and Meghan Messenger, emailed Adm. Burke - the vice chief of naval operations - in hopes of reestablishing the business relationship. That outreach did not yield results for Next Jump right away, but in 2021 Burke agreed to take Kim's call. At the time, Burke was Commander Naval Forces Europe and Africa. Kim allegedly laid out a job proposal for Burke. If the admiral secured a workforce training contract for Next Jump from Naval Forces Europe, and stayed in the Navy six months afterwards to promote the training service-wide, he would get a $500,000 per year post-retirement job at Next Jump, prosecutors said. That sequence of events unfolded as allegedly discussed: Next Jump delivered trainings in Naples and Rota, and Burke went to work for the firm in late 2022 at a comparable pay rate. Burke's defense lawyer, Tim Parlatore - a Navy Reserve JAG officer with a top-level Pentagon role - argued that the military and government investigation into Burke's case had been done incompetently. However, a jury convicted Burke in May; Kim and Messenger's case went to trial in August, but ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. According to Parlatore, Burke may have had a better chance at his trial if his jury had seen the same evidence allowed in Kim and Messenger's case. Federal prosecutors asked for a 10-year sentence for Burke after his conviction. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden sentenced him to six years in prison, plus three years of supervised release.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 15:41:45

Long Beach Salvage Operation Passes 50 Boxes Recovered,https://maritime-executive.com/article/long-beach-salvage-operation-passes-50-boxes-recovered,,19/09/2025 16:37:57,,"The Unified Command overseeing the operations in the Port of Long Beach reports that progress is continuing to be made in the efforts to recover from the container collapse aboard the vessel Mississippi alongside Pier G on September 9. One of the focuses, in addition to removing boxes from the harbor, is to stabilize the collapsed containers and to safely reach the damaged emission barge that is alongside the vessel. In the update, they reported that a total of 54 containers have now been recovered from the harbor and from the pier. In addition to boxes falling into the harbor, a small number fell off the port side of the vessel onto Pier G. The first two boxes were recovered the day after the accident, and as of last weekend, September 14, a total of 32 containers had been recovered. Two container bays, one midship and the other on the stern, collapsed during the incident on September 9. Numerous boxes remain askew on the vessel, with one of the efforts focusing on stabilizing those boxes. The Unified Command reports that unaffected boxes are being unloaded so that crews can safely access STAX 2. The company that operates the emissions barge, Stax Engineering, told The Maritime Executive earlier this month that its team was working to assess the damage and get the vessel back into service. Several of the boxes landed on the barge, causing one minor injury as the crew ran from the scene. The Unified Command reports the operation is ongoing with a “Container Recovery Group,” and salvage crews working alongside International Longshore and Warehouse Union members. It previously estimated that 75 containers had fallen from the Mississippi. The 500-yard safety zone remains in place around the Mississippi. The Captain of the Port has been working with vessels, and as of Wednesday, September 17, a total of 55 commercial vessels have been guided through the safety zone to maintain operations in the port. A containment boom remains around the site, although they previously said the oil leaking from the emissions barge had been stopped.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 21:28:17
First U.S.-Built WTIV Charybdis Arrives in Virginia to Begin Installations,https://maritime-executive.com/article/first-u-s-built-wtiv-charybdis-arrives-in-virginia-to-begin-installations,,19/09/2025 15:44:23,,"Charybdis, the massive wind turbine installation vessel built for Dominion Energy, has reached its home in Virginia after nearly five years of construction. The vessel, which is the first for the U.S. registry and one of the biggest vessels of its kind, remains on track to begin installations for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project later this month, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy told The Maritime Executive. Dominion confirmed that the vessel docked on Wednesday, September 17, at Portsmouth Marine Terminal in the Hampton Bays area of Virginia. It had departed Texas on August 22, according to its AIS signal. Built by Seatrium’s AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas, Charybdis is 472 feet by 184 feet (144 x 56 meters) with accommodations for up to 119 people. The 426-foot crane is capable of lifting up to 2,200 tons, including next-generation turbines up to 12 megawatts or larger. Work on the ship began in December 2020, and it was launched in April 2024. Jack-up and sea trials began early this year, and Dominion reports delivery occurred earlier this month. Built and registered in the U.S., the vessel is Jones Act compliant, giving it greater flexibility in its operations versus the international vessels that have been employed for the installation of the other U.S. wind farms. Charybdis is one of the largest vessels of its kind (Dominion Energy) With the arrival of the ship in Virginia, CVOW moves into its next phase and is anticipated to begin delivering its first electrons to the grid in just a few months, early 2026. The company reports the project is at approximately the 60 percent mark in its installation. Work has been completed for the installation of 168 of the monopile foundations, as well as 59 of the transition pieces, for a total of 176 turbines. The first of three offshore substations has also been installed, while the deepwater offshore export cables have also been installed. Work is currently underway on the near shore offshore export cables and the inter-array cables. Onshore, work is 93 percent complete for the electric transmission installation. Construction of the offshore wind farm remains on schedule for completion in late 2026. It will be the largest U.S. offshore wind farm with a total of 176 Siemens Gamesa 14 MW turbines and a total capacity of 2.6 GW.",Maritime Executive,19/09/2025 21:28:17

U.S. Oceanography Cornerstone Research Vessel Retires After 50 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-oceanography-cornerstone-research-vessel-retires-after-50-years,,20/09/2025 00:06:03,,"A research vessel that has been the cornerstone of ocean science in the U.S. for five decades is set to retire, marking an end to an illustrious career. The R/V Endeavor, which has been synonymous with ocean research in the modern era, will retire on September 20 upon the completion of its final mission. Two weeks ago, Endeavor embarked on its final mission, which was focused on the long-term impacts of oil and gas extraction on ecosystems along the Atlantic coast, including historical, active, and future production areas. On September 20, the vessel will return to its home port at the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) Bay Campus in Narragansett, ending a long career in ocean science. First launched in 1975, the ship is owned by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and operated by URI’s Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO) under a charter party agreement. Endeavor was one of three intermediate-class research vessels commissioned by NSF and built by Peterson Builders, in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. At 185 feet (56 meters) and officially christened at the GSO pier on December 11, 1976, the vessel was designed from the keel up for oceanographic work, a floating laboratory built to advance exploration and discovery. Nuala Pell, the wife of Senator Claiborne Pell, broke the traditional bottle of champagne across the bow. Based out of Narragansett, Endeavor has lived up to its billing as the cornerstone of oceanography in the U.S., spending approximately 200 days a year at sea for five decades. Her illustrious career is unrivalled. She brought on board over 8,000 scientists, engineers, technicians, students, and teachers who spent 9,600 days at sea carrying out a total of 736 scientific expeditions. Over her long career, Endeavor sailed over one million miles and made port calls in 22 countries. The longest expedition for the ship with a capacity of 16 scientists, 12 crewmembers, and two marine technicians was 38 days, while the deepest instrument deployment was at a depth of 8,700 meters. Endeavor’s career started through baptism by fire. Only four days after her christening, she found herself responding to one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history after tanker Argo Merchant ran aground off Nantucket Island during a storm on December 15, 1976. The tanker was carrying more than 7.7 million gallons of heavy fuel oil that spilled into the ocean after the tanker broke apart. The disaster thrust Endeavor on her first mission studying the movement of currents, analyzing the spread of oil hydrocarbons, and assessing the impact on marine ecosystems. The series of trips to the spill site lasted three months and is considered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be the birth of oil spill response. Apart from the spill response, the ship has also been instrumental in the advancement of the oil and gas industry. Owing to her proximity to the Gulf Stream, the vessel has led a number of missions, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s, focusing on circulation and biogeochemistry studies. Narragansett Dawn, now under construction, will start sailing in 2027 as the new research vessel (URI) A key milestone for Endeavor’s history was in 1993 when she underwent a major mid-life refit that saw her length increased from 177 feet to her current overall length of 185 feet (56 meters). After that, she would go on to carry out other critical missions like responding to the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, delivering humanitarian aid, and undertaking post-earthquake seafloor surveys. The same year, she was involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response in the Gulf of Mexico. Following the retirement of Endeavor, URI is preparing to welcome a new research vessel at its Narragansett Bay Campus pier. The $125 million vessel, which is also owned by NSF and has been named Narragansett Dawn, will arrive in 2027. The 199-foot (61-meter) ship is being constructed at the Bollinger Houma Shipyards in Houma, Louisiana.",Maritime Executive,20/09/2025 04:26:04
USCG Releases Dramatic Video of Interdiction of Narco Fast-Go Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-releases-dramatic-video-of-interdiction-of-narco-fast-go-boat,,19/09/2025 23:30:23,,"The U.S. Coast Guard began an enhanced drug interdiction program in the Pacific during August, known as Operation Pacific Viper. To date, it reports that more than 75,000 pounds of cocaine have been seized in the Eastern Pacific. Highlighting the law enforcement portion of the operation, the USCG released dramatic video of a recent chase and capture of a fast go boat. The low-profile vessel has three large outboard motors and is typical of the boats the drug cartels built to avoid capture. They did not report what was seized from this vessel, but the video shows three men being taken into custody. The USCG reports a total of 59 individuals suspected of narco-trafficking have been seized in more than 20 interdictions since the operation was launched. “The Coast Guard’s maritime fighting force is relentless in our ongoing operations to counter narco-terrorism,” said Rear Adm. Jeffrey Novak, deputy commander Pacific Area. “Our latest milestone through Operation Pacific Viper – over 75,000 pounds of cocaine seized – underscores our commitment to dismantling Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Transnational Criminal Organizations engaged in narco-trafficking.” CARTEL CRACKDOWN.

BOEM Tells Court it Wants to Resume Review of Permits for SouthCoast Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/boem-tells-court-it-wants-to-resume-review-of-permits-for-southcoast-wind,,19/09/2025 23:12:06,,"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management formally filed with a federal court on Thursday, September 18, calling for the court to set aside the actions of the Biden administration so that it can restart the environmental review on a Massachusetts offshore wind farm project as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing review of the industry. The Department of Justice made the filing to the federal court as part of a legal action brought in March 2025 by Nantucket, which was challenging the approval of the Construction and Operation Plan for the proposed 2.4 GW SoutCoast Wind. The Department of the Interior and its BOEM are parties to the suit. They have asked that the case be postponed and the permits, which were granted on January 17, just days before the end of the Biden presidency, undergo further review. The project, which was approved for up to 141 wind turbines and up to five offshore substation platforms, would be located 20 miles south of Nantucket and approximately 30 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. It is being developed by Ocean Winds, which is a joint venture between EDP Renewables and Engie. They won the lease for the project originally known as Mayflower Wind at the end of 2018, and the company points out that it spent four years in the review and approval process before the Department of the Interior issued its Record of Decision on December 20. The company has vowed to “vigorously defend” its permits. The project, however, still requires additional permits before construction can begin. In addition, it has not completed a power purchase agreement with Massachusetts. BOEM asserts in its filing that the project’s review process was rushed and may not have fully complied with federal law that requires balancing the use of the coastal waters and protecting the environment and national security. Its action is in part based on the Trump administration’s withdrawal of a 2021 regulation governing the definitions under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and Donald Trump’s executive order signed just hours into his presidency, ordering a full review of the offshore wind energy industry and the leasing processes. The Trump administration is contending that the Biden administration's policies constrained regulatory review. They have made similar allegations against other offshore wind projects, although in this case BOEM has stopped short of asking the court to vacate the permits. Instead, it says they require additional review. While the review is ongoing, it says the other legal challenges should be stayed. The filing in the SouthCoast Wind case comes after the administration moved to vacate the permits for Maryland’s offshore wind project. It has also declared that it will be making a filing against the New England Wind project, while the administration is already fighting in court after imposing a stop work order for Revolution Wind being built off Massachusetts. Ørsted, which is developing Revolution Wind, has challenged the action in a Washington, D.C. court, while the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island are also challenging the actions in a Rhode Island court. This week, the states filed for a preliminary injunction to permit work to resume. The Department of Justice has filed to combine the cases, saying they all involve the same set of issues. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has recently made statements saying he believes the offshore wind industry is over in the United States. He said the administration was reviewing five projects, and with the withdrawal of tax credits and other investments and incentives, the industry is no longer economical. A coalition of U.S. states, however, filed another case earlier this year challenging the administration's review of the industry and continues to call for the construction of renewable energy resources.",Maritime Executive,20/09/2025 04:26:04
Chief Engineer Pleads Guilty in 2024 MSC Runaway Incident in Charleston,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chief-engineer-pleads-guilty-in-2024-msc-runaway-incident-in-charleston,,19/09/2025 21:50:57,,"The chief engineer working on the MSC Michigan VII in June 2024, when the vessel had a runaway incident as it was departing Charleston, South Carolina, entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney’s office. In filing the agreement in the U.S. District Court in South Carolina, the U.S. Attorney’s office revealed a litany of problems aboard the vessel, which the crew was dealing with before the governor controlling the main engine failed on June 5, causing the vessel to reach speeds of up to 16 to 17 knots, more than twice the legal limit, in Charleston harbor. Fernando San Diego San Juan, age 61 and a Filipino national, had joined the vessel as chief engineer in April 2024. Under the terms of the agreement, he agrees to plead guilty to one count that he failed to report a hazardous condition to the U.S. Coast Guard when the ship arrived in South Carolina, and a second charge that he obstructed the investigation after the incident by giving false information to the USCG and National Transportation Safety Board investigators as well as instructing another engineer not to tell the investigators about the actions taken aboard the vessel that caused the incident. Further, they report the pilot had not been advised of any mechanical issues with the vessel. MSC Michigan VII was built in 2000 and was registered at the time of the incident in Liberia. Databases show it started operating for MSC in 2022. The vessel is 998 feet (304 meters) in length with a capacity of 6,648 TEU. According to a detailed Stipulation of Facts in Support of Guilty Plea filed with the court, San Juan was only given a five-hour handover briefing when he joined the vessel, which they call “insufficient” for him to have obtained a complete picture of the status of the engine room and all the vessel’s critical machinery. They state that he discovered that there were “numerous problems with equipment” in the engine room. They cite oil and air leaking from the crankcase safety valve of the Main Air Compressor for the main engine, and the day before the incident, he also observed the second main air compressor was not functioning properly. It could only achieve approximately 60 percent of its rated capacity. San Juan wrote up the issues, and they were reported to the master of the vessel, who notified the shoreside office of the management company. Other problems included a reduced capacity on the generators, meaning that many times the bow thruster could not be used while maneuvering. The vessel’s freshwater cooling system is also reported to have had a leak, and the cooling water for the lube oil system had developed a leak. As early as April 24, San Juan was aware that the RPMs ordered by the bridge telegraph were not always being achieved by the main engine. The only way to achieve them was to manually adjust the length of the linkage rod between the governor and the fuel rack. They report this was in part due to the poor condition of the main engine fuel injector systems and leakages in the barrels and plungers when using lower viscosity, low-sulfur fuel. The main engine required more fuel to achieve the ordered RPMs when using the lower viscosity fuel. They assert the defendant knew the manual adjustments were hazardous because they could cause the linkage rod to fail. MSC Michigan VII was departing Charleston at midday on June 5, 2024. After completing a turn and starting its departure, the third engineer realized the main engine was not achieving the ordered RPM. He leaves the control room to adjust the governor, and soon thereafter, the linkage rod disconnected from the governor. According to the court papers, the defendant tried several times unsuccessfully to reconnect the linkage rod. While a fitter was working to repair the rod, the ship became a runaway, unable to slow the main engine. Authorities ordered a main roadway bridge crossing the harbor, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, to be closed and evacuated local beaches. As the ship sped out of the harbor, it was charged that it caused more than $500,000 in damages along the shoreline. The crew was able to stop the engine by the time the ship exited the harbor. It anchored and was brought back into the port, where it was detained for 44 days by the USCG. The following day, they write in the statement of fact that the defendant told investigators that the crew never adjusted the linkage rod and that only a qualified technician would adjust the linkage rod. Further, the court papers state that the defendant approached the vessel’s fourth engineer, telling him to repeat the statements that they had not adjusted the rod. The plea agreement highlights that the first charge of failing to report the hazardous condition on the vessel has a maximum sentence of six years imprisonment and/or a fine of $250,000, as well as a term of up to three years supervised release. The charge of obstructing the proceeding also has a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and/or a fine of $250,000, as well as up to three years supervised release. No date was announced for the sentencing.",Maritime Executive,20/09/2025 04:26:04

Weather conditions prevented the Coast Guard from reaching the vessel and required calling in a helicopter to lift the crew from the deck of the grounded cargo ship. There were seven crewmembers trapped aboard the Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship Rapid (2,587 dwt). The ship had requested assistance around 0600 on September 18 as it was driven aground in the Kocaeli region, not far from Izmit. A Coast Guard vessel was able to reach the area, but according to the reports, strong winds and heavy waves prevented a rescue. The Coast Guard helicopter was sent to the area. It was able to airlift the crew to safety. The crew was reported to be uninjured after their ordeal. Turkey’s Demirören Agency published dramatic videos of the rescue. A post shared by Kenan Buluto?lu (@turkishstraits The vessel, built in 1991, was traveling from Bartin, Turkey, bound for Chornomorsk, Ukraine, with a cargo of gypsum. Based on reports from the vessel’s inspections, it appears to have a spotty safety record before this incident. In August, it was detained for 13 days by the Turkish authorities after 30 deficiencies were identified. Among the issues listed in the report was that the bridge navigational watch alarm was inoperative, as well as a range of safety and life-saving issues. The SOPEP (oil emergency plan) was also missing, along with other documentation problems. A prior inspection in June found four deficiencies and did not result in a detention. However, in February 2025, Turkish authorities reported 25 deficiencies, and in September 2024 recorded 33 deficiencies. No reason other than the bad weather was cited in the reports of the current grounding.

"EU, UK, and Australia Launch New Sanctions for Russian Energy and Tankers",https://maritime-executive.com/article/eu-uk-and-australia-launch-new-sanctions-for-russian-energy-and-tankers,,19/09/2025 18:04:17,,"The European Union announced earlier than planned its 19th sanction package, as Australia also moved to expand its efforts, and the UK added Russian supporters from Georgia. The steps come as Donald Trump has reportedly been pushing the Europeans to cut energy imports, but has yet to introduce further U.S. sanctions on Russia and the shadow tanker fleet. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, detailed the sweeping package as the next step in Europe’s efforts. She said that “Russia has shown the full extent of its contempt for diplomacy and international law,” citing the increased drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. She noted that even the EU’s office in Kyiv was struck. In addition, the EU assets that the threats to the union are rising. It pointed to the Russian drones that had violated the airspace of both Poland and Romania. “These are not the actions of someone who wants peace,” said von der Leyen, reporting that Europe was responding by increasing the pressure. “So we are banning imports of Russian LNG into European markets,” she said in the statement detailing the proposed next phase of the sanctions. “It is time to turn off the tap. We are prepared for this.” The EU will sanction an additional 118 vessels from the shadow fleet. This will bring its total to 560 vessels, once again surpassing the UK, which recently claimed to have the most tankers under sanction. This comes after the EU lowered the price cap on Russian oil to $47.60. The EU also proposes a range of other steps, including full transaction bans against Rosneft and Gazpromneft. It is also expanding with sanctions for international refineries, oil traders, and petrochemical companies in third countries, including China, that are dealing with Russia. Additional financial sanctions will include banks supporting the trade and aiding in sanction evasion, as well as, for the first time, the EU proposes restrictive measures on crypto platforms and prohibiting transactions in cryptocurrencies. Von der Leyen asserted that the efforts have already brought down Russia’s oil revenues by 90 percent. The sanctions, she said, are severely affecting the Russian economy. She cited 17 percent interest rates, high inflation, and declining access to financing and revenues. The efforts still require full approval, while they also noted that the package is aligning with G7 partners. Australia also responded, announcing it would add another 955 shadow fleet vessels to its sanctions. With these additional listings, the Albanese government will have sanctioned more than 150 shadow fleet vessels since it first sanctions rolled out in June 2025. Australia said it is taking its actions alongside international partners, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Japan, and that it is adopting the $47.60 price cap. Australia also maintains its total ban on imports from Russia of oil and refined petroleum. The UK expanded its sanctions list just a week ago, adding 70 tankers to the restrictions. In total, it has sanctions on 495 tankers versus 440 currently by the EU, which gave the UK the claim that it has now targeted more oil tankers than any other country. Today’s action by the UK targets two Georgians, a politician and a businessman, who it says are supporting Russia. As part of these efforts, the UK added two small, Russian-owned product tankers to the sanctions. It reports that the Bavly (6,613 dwt) and the Karakuz (6,640 dwt), both flagged in Russia, are transporting Russian oil to the Georgian port of Batumi.",Maritime Executive,20/09/2025 04:26:04

Customs Officers Arrested and Containers of Illegal Goods Seized at Piraeus,https://maritime-executive.com/article/customs-officers-arrested-and-containers-of-illegal-goods-seized-at-piraeus,,20/09/2025 00:25:47,,"The European Union (EU) is intensifying the fight against illegal goods imported from China, which are denying the bloc millions in revenues. This week, the Port of Piraeus in Greece became the entry epicenter of the illicit trade, as officials reported the seizure of a massive amount of goods and an ongoing monitoring operation. The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) said it has brought charges against six individuals, including two customs officers, for allegedly being involved in criminal networks flooding the EU market with goods fraudulently imported from China. The six are being charged in relation to a raid that happened at the port at the end of June and which resulted in the seizure of 2,435 shipping containers that were filled with illegally imported goods, primarily e-bikes, textiles, and footwear. The illegal goods seizure, they reported, is the largest to date, and could have caused €250 ($294 million) in damages through evading customs duties and value-added tax (VAT). The investigation carried out by EPPO code-named “Calypso” saw coordinated raids across Greece, Spain, France, and Bulgaria targeting criminal networks managing the entire circuit of importing illegal goods from China into the EU. The networks, which are mainly controlled by Chinese nationals, are also involved in money laundering. During the raid, 10 suspects were arrested, including two customs officers and four customs brokers. The two customs officers have now been charged with repeated false certification, causing unlawful gains and damage to the EU budget, and abetting customs fraud. The four customs brokers are facing charges of repeated customs fraud, as well as inciting false certification. The Port of Piraeus, which in 2024 handled 4.2 million containers and is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, has become the entry port of choice for the illicit trade, according to EPPO. A network of professional enablers at the port facilitates the entry of the goods into EU markets through undervaluation or misclassification, thus enabling the importers to evade custom duties. Through a chain of buffer and shell companies, the goods are then sold to companies in specific countries and find their way to the market. EPPO is highlighting that the first 500 containers were seized during the raid in June, with an additional 1,935 containers that were in transit to the EU also being seized upon arrival at Piraeus. The seized containers are currently undergoing inspection, with all revealing similar fraudulent practices of misdeclaration and undervaluation. “Highly organized criminal networks have been specializing in this kind of fraud for years. They have grown accustomed to causing massive damage to our finances and economies with close to no risk,” said Laura Codru?a Kövesi, European Chief Prosecutor. EPPO contends that the fraudulent, illegal importation of goods into the EU has been ongoing for at least eight years, causing an estimated loss of at least €350 million ($412 million) in customs duties and €450 million ($530 million) in VAT. The EU has been trying to protect its market by imposing punitive anti-dumping duties on imports from China, something that has often instigated trade wars with Beijing, often retaliating.",Maritime Executive,20/09/2025 09:27:59

What the WTO's Deal to Curb Fishery Subsidies Could Mean,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/what-the-wto-s-deal-to-curb-fishery-subsidies-could-mean,,21/09/2025 17:10:08,,"[By Daniel Skerritt and Rashid Sumaila] After nearly 25 years of negotiations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) finally has its first legally binding agreement to tackle government fisheries subsidies. After two-thirds of WTO members ratified the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, the deal has entered into force. It marks a long-overdue step toward addressing the role harmful fisheries subsidies play in overfishing. Fisheries subsidies can cause harm by distorting markets and creating unequal competition — so-called “trade injuries.” In addition, they can cause ecological harm by increasing the capacity of fishing vessels and fleets. The result is overcapacity: too many boats chasing too few fish, which often leads to overfishing. When WTO talks on fisheries subsidies began in 2001, fish populations were already in decline. Today, 38 per cent of fish stocks are overfished, and a further 50 per cent are fully exploited. That means most of the world’s fisheries are being fished at or beyond their biological limits. For decades, government subsidies have helped industrial fishing fleets expand, often with little regard for sustainability. These subsidies have distorted access to fish and seafood, fuelled overfishing and harmed coastal communities — especially in low-income countries where fish are critical to food security and livelihoods. This agreement is a major milestone, but it’s only the beginning. Here’s what the agreement covers, why it matters and what needs to happen next to protect ocean health and ensure an equitable ocean economy for coastal communities. What the agreement covers and why it matters WTO members first raised the issue of harmful fisheries subsidies at the Fourth Ministerial Conference in Doha in 2001. For years, talks made little headway — until the adoption of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. Target 14.6 of the SDGs explicitly called on the WTO to: “Prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies.” This helped re-energize negotiations, culminating in the adoption of the subsidies agreement at the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022. The agreement includes three key prohibitions targeting the worst kinds of subsidies. First, ratifying WTO members must stop subsidizing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (Article 3). Second, they must end subsidies for vessels targeting overfished stocks unless they can demonstrate that effective management measures are in place to rebuild those stocks (Article 4). Third, subsidies for fishing on the unregulated high seas are banned (Article 5). While these measures don’t address all subsidies that contribute to overcapacity, they target some of the most egregious forms of financial support. Another critical part of the agreement is Article 8, which strengthens transparency and accountability. Members must now provide detailed information annually, including information on fish stocks, conservation and management measures, fleet capacity and the names of subsidized vessels. Historically, fisheries subsidies data has been patchy and incomplete. Better data will help identify who benefits from public financial support and whether it aligns with sustainability goals. The agreement also introduces more equitable expectations for developing and least developed countries. These members are granted an extra two years before they must implement subsidy prohibitions and, crucially, can access the WTO Fish Fund — a funding mechanism that helps countries implement the agreement through technical assistance and partnerships. While the agreement does not fully level the playing field, it establishes that major subsidizers must carry the greatest burden. Challenges, Gaps and Next Steps Despite its strengths on paper, the agreement only covers a fraction of the estimated $22 billion in harmful fisheries subsidies provided by governments each year. The most prevalent of all the harmful subsidies, fuel subsidies, remain largely untouched. Another major limitation is that it only applies to countries that have ratified the agreement. As of now, some major subsidizers — including Indonesia and Thailand, two of the world’s top 10 subsidy providers — have yet to ratify. In a 2021 report we wrote for ocean conservation group Oceana, we found that just 10 countries are responsible for 64 percent of global harmful subsidies. Even with this agreement in force, without their participation, large gaps will remain. Another challenge is ensuring transparency and data disclosure. While the agreement includes stronger notification requirements, it lacks detailed reporting guidelines. Much of the implementation will depend on self-reporting and peer accountability between members. Without clear standards or enforcement mechanisms, many subsidy programs could remain opaque or under-reported. To have real impact, the WTO must develop robust and standardized reporting frameworks. Whether this agreement will save fish, or merely save face, will come down to how it’s implemented. Success will hinge on whether WTO members hold each other accountable and whether industry, civil society and researchers can push their governments toward genuine compliance. Importantly, the subsidies agreement was never meant to be the end of the conversation. Its entry into force triggers a four-year countdown to negotiate the next phase. They must address the most damaging subsidies of all, those that fund fishing by rich foreign fleets in the waters of other nations, and those that drive overcapacity, to achieve a comprehensive agreement. These policies have the greatest potential ecological and equity impact but are the hardest to reach consensus on. Fortunately, we’re now closer to that goal. The entry into force of this agreement provides the ideal platform from which SDG Target 14.6 can be fully achieved. Putting an end to billions in fishing subsidies would restore fish stocks, support coastal communities, and improve ocean health for all. The job is not yet done.

Iranian Shipping Will Be Affected by UN Snap-Back Sanctions,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/iranian-shipping-will-be-affected-by-un-snap-back-sanctions,,21/09/2025 16:58:50,,"The UN Security Council voted on September 19 to reject an attempt to delay the re-imposition of the 2015 sanctions regime, under an automatic mechanism which can be triggered if Iran fails to observe previous agreements made to monitor activities associated with nuclear weapons development. The move follows the failure of an Iranian team negotiating with France, Germany and the United Kingdom, known as the E3, to make credible proposals. The Iranian negotiating team, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, requested a postponement of the snapback in exchange for a promise to re-open discussions with the United States, but without offering any substantive indications of what Iran might offer in such negotiations. Moreover, from furious debates both within the Iranian parliament and within the government-controlled media, it was unclear even if Foreign Minister Araghchi had the authority to promise the resumption of talks, let alone what such negotiations might concede. Therefore, unless a breakthrough can be achieved by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian during the forthcoming General Assembly in New York, the 2015 sanctions regime will be re-imposed on Iran on September 27. But given the failure of negotiations between the E3 and Iran so far, the Iranians will have to make concrete proposals in writing, with the declared backing of the Iranian Supreme Leader, if snapback is to be averted. The sanctions regime on track to be imposed will be significantly more effective than current restrictions imposed on Iran. Iran is currently under US maximum pressure sanctions, and the sanctions regimes imposed separately by Western nations. But the re-imposed regime will have UN authorization, the lack of which in the separate national sanctions schemes currently in force provides an excuse for some countries, such as China, India, Malaysia and the UAE, to continue trading with Iran. Restrictions on oil and gas exports, shipping, banking and access to the international financial system, weapons production, insurance and technical imports will all be tightened. The prospect of this occurring is already provoking heated controversy in Iran, where the consequences are seen as potentially devastating. It is of some significance that Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping had their third telephone conversation this year on September 19, and are on track for a face-to-face meeting in South Korea. In these discussions, China’s domestic needs to ease the threat of US tariffs are likely to be prioritized over any desire to provide support to Iran. The increased pressures will have direct economic impacts. But it will also have political stability consequences, feeding through into the ferocious internal debate within the Iranian political elite between the hardliners and the IRGC, juxtaposed against pragmatists led by the Iranian President Pezeshkian. For the maritime community, a reinvigorated anti-Iranian sanctions regime is likely to impact the operations of the government-owned 115 vessel merchant fleet operated by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line Group (IRISL) and subsidiary companies, and the 38 aging VLCC tankers operated by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC).

UK Planning to Open an Additional Submarine Dockyard,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-planning-to-open-an-additional-submarine-dockyard,,21/09/2025 23:04:57,,"In response to a parliamentary written question, the British Ministry of Defence has confirmed that as part of a $460m upgrade to Rosyth Dockyard on the East coast of Scotland, a docking facility is to be created able to receive Dreadnought Class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The requirement has arisen because once launched from Barrow, scheduled not before 2028, first-in-class HMS Dreadnought will be too large to get back into Barrow after its fit-out and during sea trials. The lack of sufficient space is likely to get worse, as submarine production at Barrow is accelerated to deliver a submarine every 18 months as part of the AUKUS program. Nor will there be capacity for the boat in the Faslane Naval Base on the Clyde. Rosyth Dockyard, with HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) under maintenance in 2024 (Google Earth/Airbus/CJRC) Although it still retains a Royal Navy presence in the form of the shore station HMS Caledonia, the Rosyth Dockyard was privatized in 1993 and bought by Babcock International. The dockyard currently has a role is breaking up decommissioned nuclear submarines, the Royal Navy’s two aircraft carriers were completed at Rosyth, and Type 31 frigates are built in the yard. A submarine maintenance facility was built at the yard in the late 1980s, but was never brought into use before the work was transferred to Devonport. Hence it is likely that the new facility can take advantage of some existing infrastructure. With a period approaching when the UK’s nuclear attack submarine fleet is to nearly double in size, with the nuclear ballistic Vanguard Class coming out of service and the Dreadnoughts coming into service, the Ministry of Defence may have concluded that having only two active submarine dockyards, at Faslane and Devonport, presents too much concentration of risk and insufficient contingency capacity. The scope and role of the new facility, and who is going to pay for it, is likely to be the subject of ongoing discussions between Babcock and the UK government.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 04:44:21
White House Releases Video of Third Venezuelan Boat Strike,https://maritime-executive.com/article/white-house-releases-video-of-third-venezuelan-boat-strike,,21/09/2025 22:35:24,,"On Friday, the Trump administration announced a third strike on a suspected smuggling boat off the coast of Venezuela, resulting in the deaths of three individuals on board. The attack brings the fatality count for the new interdiction campaign to 17 in total. According to a statement on the president's social media platform, Truth Social, the strike occurred in international waters, and no U.S. forces were harmed. The previous two attacks were reportedly carried out by drone operators working for U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), without prior boarding or attempts at arrest - a departure from the previous Coast Guard-led law enforcement effort in the Caribbean. The US bombed a third boat off Venezuela coast. pic.twitter.com/1tGPBWg95f Lawyers within the Pentagon are reportedly concerned about what the strikes could bring for the military personnel involved, who could bear personal liability in the event that a court determined that these interdictions are unjustified. The current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), the congressional act that authorizes the White House to take lethal action abroad, dates back to 2001. It is limited to Al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups with ties to the 9/11 attacks. Some military lawyers and retired JAG officers believe that the authorization does not extend to cocaine traffickers, even if the White House has declared a Venezuelan gang to be a terrorist organization, and there is active debate over whether the president's Article II powers (as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces) extend to lethal force against noncombatants. The individuals on the boats were likely fishermen with a side business in cocaine logistics, local residents on the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela told AP. With Venezuela's economy in tatters and the region's fisheries depleted, locals have few ways to make a living, and occasional trips for cocaine smugglers and human traffickers offer those with workboats a way to live well. The smuggling boats are reportedly easy to distinguish because of their large, powerful and plural outboards, which deliver far more horsepower than the equipment used by ""legitimate"" fishermen. The strikes have caused concern among the peninsula's entire fishing community, not just those engaged in illicit trade. President Donald Trump has warned that Venezuelan fishermen might not want to go out right now, and many of them agree; anecdotally, fishing activity off the coast has fallen. Venezuela's National Aquatic Institute has announced a ban on fishing more than 30 miles off of the northern Paria Peninsula, and the Venezuelan military has pledged to protect fishing interests in the area. ""I'm afraid to go fishing because of the situation they're doing to us, because it's not anyone's fault what's happening. In reality, one goes out to work fearfully to earn their daily bread,"" fisherman José Machado told Telemundo.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 04:44:21
U.S. Revokes Sanctions Waiver on Iran’s Chabahar Port,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-revokes-sanctions-waiver-on-iran-s-chabahar-port,,21/09/2025 20:24:07,,"The U.S. government has revoked a sanctions exemption policy on Iran’s Chabahar port, a move seen as likely to affect the India-led development in the facility. In the past few months, the U.S. has declared a maximum pressure policy to isolate the Iranian regime, with tighter sanctions introduced against the country’s shipping sector. However, due to an exemption policy introduced by the U.S in 2018, Chabahar port has been insulated from the sanctions affecting the rest of Iran’s infrastructure. At the time, the exemption was to facilitate Afghanistan reconstruction. During the same year, the Indian Ports Global Limited (IPGL) took over the operations of Chabahar port. This deal was formalized last year through a 10-year contract between IPGL and the Port & Maritime Organization of Iran. Under the agreement, IPGL committed to invest $370 million in the development of the port. Located on Iran’s south-eastern coast along the Gulf of Oman, Chabahar port is a strategic investment for India as it targets to boost regional trade with central Asian countries, including Afghanistan. In addition, the Chabahar operations have seen India and Iran boost ties. Early this month, the two countries held diplomatic consultations in Tehran. The talks centered on advancing the Chabahar port project as well as the International North-South Transport Corridor, a multimodal route envisaged to connect the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea. The U.S. move to end its sanctions waiver on Chabahar port will affect India’s regional connectivity plans. “The Secretary of State has revoked the sanctions waiver issued in 2018 effective September 29, 2025. Once the revocation is effective, persons who operate the Chabahar port may expose themselves to sanctions under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA),” said the U.S Department of State. Under India’s control, Chabahar port container throughput has grown immensely - from 6,000 TEU to over 90,000 TEU in the last two years. The ongoing modernization of the facility is now uncertain, especially if India abandons the project. Further, the Chabahar project presents a diplomatic conundrum for India as it is trying to balance its relations between U.S. and Iran. India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal is expected to visit Washington this week to progress tariff negotiations. Last month, the Trump administration doubled tariffs on Indian imports to 50%, which India hopes to reduce in scheduled negotiations this week.

Iranian Navy Stokes a Political Problem in South Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-stokes-a-political-problem-in-south-africa,,21/09/2025 18:07:27,,"The Iranian Navy, and its potential participation in a South African naval exercise, is being used as a tool to prosecute political objectives, both in South Africa and in Iran. Iran has lost many friends and allies, along with regional influence, since the conflict in Gaza initiated a roll-back of its Axis of Resistance. Hezbollah in Lebanon and Assad in Syria have been lost, Iranian influence curtailed in Iraq, and Armenia’s peace negotiations with Azerbaijan have come about at the expense of Iran. Even the confidence of support from Russia and China has waned, as both place greater emphasis on achieving political objectives with the United States than supporting Iran with its regional ambitions. So with some enthusiasm, Iran has grabbed the hand of friendship offered by South Africa, which is seeking to attract participation in a joint naval exercise to be held under South African leadership. Of the BRICS nations invited to attend, representatives from South Africa, Russia, China, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran attended a preparatory meeting in Cape Town on the Mosi-3 naval exercise in June. The exercise was scheduled to be conducted off the Western Cape in November, and would have followed on from the Exercise Mosi-1 held in November 2019 and Exercise Mosi-2 held in March 2023. The exercise has since been postponed, when South Africa realized that it would clash with the G20 conference scheduled to be held in South Africa at the same time. That clash was sufficient to prompt President Trump to cancel his attendance. In the meantime, Iran had followed up the fleeting opportunity to participate in Exercise Mosi-3 by inviting the South African Chief of Staff General Rudzani Maphwanya to visit Tehran. Maphwanya was received by his Iranian opposite number Major-General Seyyed Abdolrahim Mousavi on August 12, his visit to Tehran not apparently approved beforehand by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. At the meeting, Maphwanya said South Africa shared ‘common goals’ with the ‘peace-loving nation of Iran’, condemned US aggression and said it supported ‘Tehran’s outreach to Africa’. This may have thrilled the Iranians, but not President Ramaphosa - who objected to this unprecedented freelancing by the South African military into the political space, especially at a time when South Africa is seeking to improved relations with the United States. But rather than firing General Maphwanya, the President’s subsequent criticism of him was considered by many in South Africa to be muted, insufficient to unwind the precedent set by General Maphwanya’s visit. The head of South Africa’s Navy, Admiral Monde Lobese, visited the Iranian naval base in Bandar Abbas in August last year. In June 2021, IRINS Makran (K441) and the frigate IRINS Sahand (F74) made a port call in Cape Town, en route to Russia, and IRINS Makran returned in May 2023 with the frigate IRINS Dena (F75) on the last leg of the 86th Flotilla’s round the world cruise. It remains to be seen when Exercise Mosi-3 will be rescheduled. But if it comes to pass, it will be a naval exercise with greater than normal political significance.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 04:44:21
Shanghai University's Uncrewed Vessels Support China's Maritime Expansion,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/shanghai-university-s-uncrewed-vessels-support-china-s-maritime-expansion,,21/09/2025 17:42:44,,"[By Astrid Young] ASPI’s newly expanded China Defence Universities Tracker reveals how leading Chinese research institutions, including Shanghai University (SHU), are developing advanced uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) to boost China’s military and territorial ambitions. SHU’s Jinghai series are reportedly the first Chinese uncrewed vessels to operate in the South and East China seas and the Antarctic. Equipped with advanced technologies such as radar sensors and control systems, SHU’s USVs conduct scientific missions that enhance China’s maritime domain awareness and its ability to project power in contested waters. USVs are becoming an important capability in the Indo-Pacific’s intensifying maritime contest. As marine vehicles that operate on the surface of the water, USVs are capable of long-endurance autonomy to support research, surveillance and military operations. Like drones, they also function without an onboard crew. For example, the United States Navy deployed USVs in 2022 for operational surveillance in the Persian Gulf, a contested maritime environment where US vessels are often challenged by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Navy. Historically, the US has had a technological edge, but China’s rapid advances in autonomy, swarm intelligence and cross-domain integration—linking USVs with uncrewed systems in the air, space and land domains—are closing the gap. Established in 2010, SHU’s Research Institute of Unmanned Surface Vehicle Engineering is China’s first dedicated USV research institute. The institute has a stated focus on uncrewed, intelligent and swarming transportation systems for military and civilian uses, with the explicit goal of contributing to China’s maritime and polar strategies as well as national defense. SHU holds a secret-level security clearance, an official certification given by key military and defense committees of the Chinese Communist Party that enable it to undertake classified defense projects. ASPI’s Defence Universities Tracker assesses SHU as a high-risk university for its involvement in defense research, strong ties to China’s defense industry, and supervision by the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. The institute has developed 15 intelligent USVs, named the ‘Jinghai’ series, that have been deployed on numerous research and geological survey vessels and procured by the China Maritime Safety Administration and the State Oceanic Administration for use on their patrol and surveillance vessels. Each of the Jinghai vessels is specialized for specific mission tasks. This includes: conducting hydrographic surveys; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; search and rescue operations; firepower strikes; naval battlefield information support; and mine clearing. Shanghai University’s series of 15 Jinghai uncrewed boats and where they were tested. Source: Shanghai University Artificial Intelligence Research Institute. In 2013, Jinghai-1 conducted an exploration in the South China Sea with Coast Guard Ship 166, surveying more than 20 islands and reefs in the Paracel and Spratly Islands. This exploration provided data assistance for China’s subsequent reef reclamation and artificial island construction in 2014. This included the Fiery Cross Reef—a contested part of the Spratly Islands claimed by many countries. Between 2015 and 2017, SHU’s Jinghai-3 conducted extensive geological surveying and nautical mapping of the islands and reefs in the South and East China Seas, deployed from the Xiangyanghong 19 survey vessel. This timing corresponds with China’s large-scale reef reclamation and island construction in 2013 and extensive infrastructure construction in the following years. The research team was commended by the East China Sea Navigation Support Center of the Ministry of Transport, which recognized that the exploration ‘significantly improved [China’s] marine mapping ... and ability to safeguard national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests’. That center also procured the Jinghai-2 USV for its own use in China’s surrounding waters and in Antarctica. In 2014, SHU’s Jinghai-2 was reportedly China’s first uncrewed vessel to survey Antarctica. The survey results identified an anchorage location for China’s Xuelong polar research vessel. In 2023, two Jinghai uncrewed boats were equipped onto the Chinese Antarctic scientific expedition vessels Xuelong and Xuelong 2 and conducted surveying around China’s research station Changcheng and Marie Byrd Land, an unclaimed Antarctic region. The expedition was crucial in supporting the construction of Qinling, China’s fifth Antarctic station and its first on Antarctica’s Pacific coast. SHU’s Jinghai vessels were also deployed for coastal security patrols during major events including the 2017 BRICS Summit, 2017 Bo’ao Forum and 2018 Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. In 2020, SHU built the BGP Boy, reportedly China’s first dedicated USV for seismic exploration. It conducted surveys of oil and gas under the sea floor with the state-owned Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting, a unit under China National Petroleum Corporation. In 2021, the USV research team tested swarm intelligence for cluster control by integrating USVs and uncrewed aerial vehicles in cross-domain swarming. The latest USV, the Jinghai-15, was developed with multi-functional reconnaissance and vigilance capabilities, both of which are crucial attributes of uncrewed combat systems. The institute has explicitly stated that cross-domain synergy—coordinated operations involving drones, vehicles and vessels guided by swarm intelligence algorithms—will be used to carry out complex surveillance missions. In the same year, SHU established a joint venture company, Jinghai Intelligent Unmanned Technology, to commercialize its USV patents. Researchers from the USV institute have since worked on national defense projects for the Central Military Commission of Science and Technology as well as the Chinese navy’s Equipment Department in areas such as autonomous defense systems. ASPI’s China Defence Universities Tracker exposes the sheer breadth of China’s research ecosystem, its integration of the Chinese Communist Party’s military-civilian fusion strategy and its depth of innovation when it comes to critical technologies. This visibility enables policymakers, defense planners and industry partners to grasp the full scope of China’s ambitions, strengthening due diligence processes, risk management and informing future policy decisions.

Landmark High Seas Treaty Set to Become International Law Next Year,https://maritime-executive.com/article/landmark-high-seas-treaty-set-to-become-international-law-next-year,,21/09/2025 17:33:21,,"Last week, the landmark Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) high seas treaty reached the milestone of 60 state ratifications, which is the threshold needed for its entry into force. The threshold was achieved after the final four countries submitted their ratification instruments during the ongoing United Nations General Assembly in New York. The countries include St Vincent and the Grenadines, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Morocco. The legislation, also referred to as the High Seas Treaty, will be legally activated from January 17, 2026. The treaty was adopted by the United Nations in June 2023 following nearly two decades of negotiations. The BBNJ agreement for the first time creates a global legal mechanism to set up large marine protected zones in the high seas areas, outside of any country’s jurisdiction. The high seas cover almost two-thirds of the oceans and have been largely ungoverned. Unfortunately, this has led to overexploitation of this global commons, with rising pollution and overfishing. As the first legally binding international agreement for the high seas, the BBNJ treaty provides tools to halt biodiversity loss and ocean degradation. Most importantly, the legislation creates a path for nations to achieve the goal of protecting at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. Currently, just one percent of international waters is protected. Worth noting is also the fact that BBNJ agreement becomes the first law to regulate use of marine genetic resources (MGRs) in international waters. This has been a major gap in global ocean governance under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS). In other words, before BBNJ, genetic materials sourced from either international seabed or international waters were arguably owned by no one, opening them up to exploitation. “While sharing the spoils of genetic resources was the most contentious issue for states to agree on in getting this landmark deal over the line, it is not where this new law will flex its muscles. Its greatest power, to my mind, lies in its ability to protect, as much as possible, the wonders of the high seas - those places far offshore, such as the White Shark Café, the Costa Rica Thermal Dome, the Gakkel Ridge and countless others,” said science journalist Dr. Olive Heffernan, who is also the author of The High Seas book.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 04:44:21

Royal Navy Returns to Sail Training for Young Officers,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/royal-navy-returns-to-sail-training-for-young-officers,,22/09/2025 02:35:22,,"The Royal Navy is looking to train officers under sail for the first time in decades by chartering a tall ship. Experts believe the unique experience of crewing a traditional sailing vessel around the British Isles will teach vital navigational skills and nurture a strong bond of teamwork and community spirit integral to life in the Royal Navy. Several trials have taken place this year on the British-flagged square rigged Sail Training Ship Pelican of London, with sailors experiencing sailing in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel and visiting Liverpool, Dublin, Belfast. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, said Lieutenant Commander David Carter, the Royal Navy’s liaison officer with the Merchant Navy, who is now hoping to charter a similar vessel for nine months in 2026, giving hundreds of trainee officers and sailors the unique experience. The initiative would mostly benefit would-be warfare officers waiting to begin their demanding courses. With space limited on Royal Navy warships, some of the key elements of practical, real-world instruction could be delivered on a sailing vessel. Lt Cdr Carter said Pelican of London was a “fabulous ship for instilling Royal Navy ethos and concentrating on training value”, hosting up to 32 trainees and four instructors at a time. “It’s also a morale lifter, a truly fabulous experience for many starting at sea.” While the tall ship may lack the technology and sensors of a modern warship, the fundamentals of seafaring are identical, and the experience of crewing such a ship has fostered a strong sense of teamwork and boosted morale. The latest batch of junior officers – both Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary – helped bring Pelican of London into Dartmouth this week after battering through a Force 8 gale in the Channel. The tall ship’s Master Captain Roy Love said life aboard his vessel – a former trawler built just after World War 2, converted into a sail training vessel for young people – was rudimentary, but the experience was hugely beneficial. “The modern Navy is very technical – we are not,” he explained. “There are few electronics. We are here to teach the basics of seamanship, what’s it like to live and work at sea, how to work together. It’s a steep learning curve for most, but the skills benefit anyone who sails with us.” Sub Lieutenant Isaac Robinson struggled with seasickness on the voyage from Dublin, but when on duty found it an exhilarating experience. “This is an experience of real life at sea – a great starting block, learning the basics of life at sea, getting into the rhythm. It’s harking back to what our ancestors did and the origins of the Navy,” said the junior officer from Ramsgate in Kent. Aboard on the same rough crossing was Royal Fleet Auxiliary Cadet Adam Dennis. Although he’s undergone six months of intensive training in college, he had not spent any time at sea until joining the Pelican. “It’s been an experience – certainly rougher than we expected, but once we’ve dried off I think we will look back and say we enjoyed it. I certainly jumped in at the deep end, picked things up on board quickly. I would absolutely recommend it,” he said. Sub Lieutenant Joel Crownshaw said crewing a vessel like the Pelican had provided an excellent introduction to important training – as well as broader experience of life at sea in the Navy. “The ship offers a good introduction - she makes approximately six knots, allowing a calm environment in which to consider situations and make measured decisions, building up confidence before you move on to larger and faster vessels,” Joel explained. “In addition, the mix of officers and ratings provided a career first introduction to personnel support and considerations – the two are generally kept quite separate up to this point. All of us found that experience incredibly beneficial in setting us up for future responsibilities.” There was also praise for the merchant crew who passed on their skills and experience to the young Royal Navy officers, like Sub Lieutenant Hilton Forsyth who sailed to Portsmouth, Dartmouth, Dublin and the wildlife haven of Lundy in the Bristol Channel and find his several weeks at sea and found them packed with “worthwhile experiences”. “The most notable benefit for warfare young officers was a navigation teaching/testing/discussion session with an experienced crew member,” Hilton added. “His teaching style is memorable and was of great benefit.” This article appears courtesy of Royal Navy News and may be found in its original form here.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 09:32:33
The Sanctions Game,https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/the-sanctions-game,,22/09/2025 00:58:46,,"Here's an extreme example of globalization's tenacity and resilience: Russia, while subject to over 30,000 separate sanctions from nations around the world, has nevertheless exported $913 billion of oil and gas these past few years. The lion's share – $213 billion – was sold to the E.U., which is, now as before, Russia's biggest rival and customer. How can this happen? And why? I've said before that cargo, like water, will find its path from seller to buyer. When that cargo is critical, as it is in the global energy markets, imagine the political and economic pressure. Even if 30,159 sanctions stand in the way of a deal, it's likely to just happen. In ""No Coffee for You"" in the May/June 2024 edition, I noted that origin paperwork for the E.U.'s Supply Chain Act might be ""cut to fit."" And while I personally consider coffee, not crude, to be the true ""black gold,"" caffeine is small change compared to fossil fuels. WORKAROUNDS Buyers and sellers are relentless in their drive to find workarounds for their businesses. They've loaded their cargoes onto Moscow's 600-vessel ""shadow fleet,"" avoided port calls using ship-to-ship transfers of oil and gas in international waters, hidden vessel ownership behind spiderwebbed shell companies and management arrangements and gotten around origin rules by blending Russian and non-sanctioned fuels together. Yet the most audacious workaround is not a tactic, but a country: Turkey. Turkey offers a systematic, structured way to indirectly but legally do business with Russia – a way that economically benefits itself, Russia and the companies that fear violating sanctions. The reason is found in Turkey's tricky diplomatic history. Turkey is nominally a Western ally with European aspirations, but its interactions with the U.S. and E.U. have suffered from strategic frictions. In 2003, Turkey's parliament refused to let U.S. troops use Incirlik Air Base for the Iraq War. In 2016, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an was targeted by a military coup, the U.S. rejected Turkey's demand for the extradition of Fetullah Gülen, a critic of Erdo?an. During the Syrian civil war, the U.S. armed Kurdish fighters whom Turkey deemed terrorists. Then, more recently, Turkey purchased Russian S-400 missiles, which broke its military compatibility with NATO, of which Turkey is a member, and led to its exclusion from the F-35 fighter program. And throughout, Cyprus has blocked Turkey's E.U. membership due to its illegal 1974 invasion of the island. That list of issues is long and potentially crippling. Perhaps, then, the surprise is not that Turkey is looking for other dance partners but that bouncers haven't escorted it out? RUSSIAN/TURKISH COOPERATION Apart from a few difficult moments, Russia has over time deepened and broadened its connection to Turkey. Evidently, Russia and Turkey see enough strategic value in each other, or need each other enough, to mend rifts as they appear. In November 2015, for example, Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 fighter jet during the Syrian civil war. Russian leader Vladimir Putin called it ""a stab in the back"" and imposed sanctions on Turkey. It looked like the end of the line. Yet within seven months, Erdo?an sent a letter of apology and, remarkably, the two countries emerged with stronger ties than before. A review of Turkish and Russian projects shows, overall, a broad spectrum of successful cooperation that helps sustain the relationship. Beginning with the Astana partnership between Turkey, Iran and Russia that paralleled U.N. efforts to broker a Syrian ceasefire, then continuing through the $23 billion TurkStream natural gas pipeline and the $20 billion Akkuyu nuclear plant, which Russia is building and maintaining, Turkey has leaned on Russia to reduce its dependence on the U.S. and E.U. In charting a diplomatic course between major powers, Turkey has recast Mediterranean trade by allowing Russia an outlet – geographically and economically – for its oil and natural gas. While doing so, Turkey has threaded the needle with its Western partners: The E.U. is Turkey's biggest trading partner, and NATO's Article 5 provides Turkey a security guarantee that Russia, especially now, cannot match. Turkey has implemented only sanctions that have been ratified by the U.N. Security Council, such as the ones targeting North Korea. So transactions with Russia that would be prohibited under U.S. or E.U. rules remain legal in Turkey. This has led to frustration for some and opportunity for others. Al-Arabiya quoted a senior U.S. Treasury official, who asked to remain anonymous: ""We've shared our concerns with the Turkish government and private sector and informed them of the significant risks of doing business with those we've sanctioned who are tied to Russia's war."" But Russia's ships passing through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus are protected under international treaty law by the 1936 Montreux Convention, at least during peacetime. And the otherwise permissive legal and diplomatic environment in Turkey encourages Turkish companies to acquire Russian business whenever possible. In 2023, for example, one company transported 49 million barrels of Russian oil, leading the U.K. to sanction it in February 2024. But its Russian oil operation didn't stop. It just moved down the hall. Three other Turkish companies with the same address and the same owners took over. A COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM The scale of Turkey's blending and re-exporting operations can be derived from statistics. Turkey's purchasing of Russian oil products went up 105 percent from 2023-2024, but its domestic oil consumption grew just eight percent – so it's not satisfying domestic demand. A refinery in Izmir, Turkey, reportedly processes 98 percent Russian crude, mostly from Lukoil. These refined oil products are labeled ""Turkish"" and become legal for export to the E.U. Similar loopholes are permitted by the E.U. when it comes to blending. In late 2023, one terminal in Ceyhan, Turkey received 26,923 tons of gasoil from Novorossiysk, then legally exported a similar quantity to a refinery in Greece ten days later, per the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Meanwhile, Turkish shipping lines have captured 55 percent of the Russian-Black Sea container market. International carriers abandoned this market, and Turkish firms expanded services specifically for Russian routes. One such line, launched in May 2022, offers its Novorossiysk Express Service to connect Russian ports with Turkish facilities and railways. And then there are the Turkish banks affiliated with the Credit Bank of Moscow. The most famous of these facilitated payments from buyers and transferred proceeds to Russian banking institutions after taking off its own commission. The comprehensive oil-for-credit scheme it was running legally bypassed traditional Western financial channels. In aggregate, Turkey has pursued an approach that has led to the establishment of other maritime clusters: a combination of clearinghouse services, financing, vessel management, port and terminal operations and shipyards for repair and refit. What is unique is the complete ecosystem that Turkey offers, which enables Russian trade to flow while Western competitors face compliance problems and legal obstacles. AN INDISPENSABLE SERVICE The key is that Turkey has cleverly maintained strategic leverage in both directions. Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), both significant Russian gateways, have not fared as well. Cyprus is constantly pressured by the E.U. while the UAE, according to the Atlantic Council, has been gray-listed by the G7's Financial Action Task Force. Right now, Turkey is providing Russia and the E.U. with an indispensable service. But, as Charles de Gaulle said, ""The graveyards are full of indispensable men.""",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 09:32:33

Charity Plans to Move Aging Frigate From Pakistan to UK as Museum Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/charity-plans-to-move-aging-frigate-from-pakistan-to-uk-as-museum-ship,,22/09/2025 02:42:47,,"A charity organization in the United Kingdom is undertaking an ambitious project that will see a decommissioned Royal Navy warship make a 6000-mile journey from Pakistan to the Clyde, where she will start a new life as a floating museum and education center. In a mission aimed at preserving the rich shipbuilding history of the River Clyde for future generations, Clyde Naval Heritage (CNH) said plans are ongoing to bring the former HMS Ambuscade back to the UK. Commissioned in 1975, the Amazon class Type 21 frigate served during the Falklands conflict as an electronic warfare picket ship, and took part in several bombardments of Argentine positions. In 1993, the warship was decommissioned and sold to the Pakistan Navy and recommissioned as PNS Tariq. She remained in active service for three decades. CNH is announcing that the Pakistan government has since donated Ambuscade to the charity to become part of the Clyde Naval & Shipbuilding Heritage site. Plans are underway to bring the vessel back to the Clyde with the ship expected to make the 6,000-mile journey from Karachi later this year. On arrival, the intention is to preserve her as a floating museum and ensure she helps preserve the rich shipbuilding history of the River Clyde. The Clyde’s shipbuilding history spans centuries, evolving from the construction of medieval fishing vessels to becoming one of the world’s most important industrial shipbuilding centers. Many commercial and naval warships have been built in the Clyde’s shipyards for both the Royal Navy and many countries around the world. They include world’s most iconic transatlantic liners such as the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth and QE2. Unfortunately, most of the shipyards are long gone and only a few pockets remain of the region's shipbuilding heritage. As part of the project to bring Ambuscade back to the Clyde, CNH has appointed consultancy firm Tricolor Collective as its lead development partner with the task of leading the next phase of project development, business planning, and strategic fundraising to bring the Clyde’s naval legacy back to life. “The Clyde’s shipbuilding heritage is a powerful symbol of Scottish innovation, craftsmanship, and industrial strength. We intend to harness that legacy to drive the regeneration of a region that has seen significant decline. Our immediate goal is to bring the former HMS Ambuscade (PNS Tariq) back from Pakistan to the Clyde, where she was built,” said O’Neill. Apart from bringing back Ambuscade, CNH also plans to create the Clyde Historic Dockyard, a new maritime heritage destination combining cultural programming, community co-creation spaces, naval innovation showcases, and heritage skills hubs. “Our vision is to create a dynamic, inclusive, and future-facing heritage destination anchored by the Ambuscade/Tariq and innovative multi-dimensional immersive access to the global maritime story,” said Sarah Dowd, Tricolor Founding Director.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 15:42:36
Morocco Celebrates Expansion Milestones in Casablanca Port Complex,https://maritime-executive.com/article/morocco-celebrates-expansion-milestones-in-casablanca-port-complex,,22/09/2025 02:27:50,,"As Morocco pushes ahead with expansion of its maritime infrastructure, last week the country launched several development initiatives in Casablanca port complex. The launch event was presided by King Mohammed VI, who is keen to position Morocco as a global maritime hub. The Casablanca port complex expansion project is valued at around $577 million. This involves renovation of a fish port, construction of a new shipyard and expansion of the cruise terminal. A new office complex is also underway, with Casablanca aiming to house port stakeholders under one roof. The fish port project is valued at $120 million, an investment targeted at expanding Morocco’s fish processing capacity and export volumes. The fish port is expected to accommodate 260 artisanal fishing boats and about 100 coastal fishing vessels. The port will also have ice generators, modern fish market and offices for shipowners. An important highlight of the launch event is King Mohammed VI’s tour of the new Casablanca port shipyard. In a speech in 2023, the King directed for development “of a strong, competitive, national commercial marine fleet.” As a follow-up measure, a Moroccan public think-tank - the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (CESE) - last year opened a public consultation for Morocco’s national shipbuilding roadmap. These efforts in domestic shipbuilding are reflected in the government’s investment of $250 million towards the Casablanca shipyard. The Moroccan National Port Agency is about to issue a private firm with rights to operate and further develop the yard. The new Casablanca port cruise terminal was also inaugurated, a project expected to boost the city’s status as a tourism destination in the Mediterranean region. The terminal has capacity to host up to 450,000 cruise passengers annually. The $72 million terminal features a 650-meter disembarkation quay, three gangways and a parking area for 44 coaches. The upgrades in Casablanca port complex are coming at a time Moroccan ports are recording growth in cargo throughput. In the first quarter of 2025, Moroccan ports reached a cargo volume of 60.80 million tons representing an increase of 10.2% year on year, according to data released recently by the Directorate of Studies and Financial Forecasts. The directorate attributed the surge in commercial activity to strengthening transshipment traffic, which accounted for 49.9% of total traffic. During the same period, cruise activity also recorded growth of 46.9%, with 55,668 cruise passengers handled in Moroccan ports.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 15:42:36
19 Smugglers Charged With Throwing Dozens of Passengers Overboard,https://maritime-executive.com/article/19-smugglers-charged-with-throwing-dozens-of-passengers-overboard,,22/09/2025 02:07:22,,"Police in the Canary Islands have charged 19 people with murder in connection with the deaths of dozens of migrants who went ""missing"" from a wooden boat on the crossing from Senegal, a route that is always perilous but may have had an additional hazard on this particular voyage. About 300 people set out from Senegal in August aboard a 20-meter wooden boat, bound for the Canary Islands and the opportunity for EU asylum. On August 24, the rescue boat Guardamar Urania made a long voyage south from Gran Canaria to reach the migrant vessel off Dajla, a town in southern Morocco (or Western Sahara). At the time of intercept and rescue, there were 248 people still alive on the vessel. Upon return to the dock, the surviving passengers identified 19 individuals as the organizers of the voyage. The survivors alleged that this group of human smugglers ""assaulted dozens of people"" and even ""threw migrant alive into the sea."" Anyone who went overboard accidentally was left behind. The motives behind these killings were twofold, according to police. The organizers allegedly wished to get rid of migrants who they believed to be practitioners of ""witchcraft,"" and thereby responsible for breakdowns, bad weather or other failures on board. Survivors told the police that the smugglers would throw ""witches"" into the sea whenever misfortune occurred. Others were selected for elimination because they disagreed with the smugglers or protested their circumstances on board. Based on the number of people who set out and the number who survived to be rescued, prosecutors estimate that the organizers killed at least 30 and likely more than 50 people. According to El Dia, the 19 smugglers face charges of bodily harm, homicide, torture, and assisting illegal immigration. Even with a well-intentioned crew, the crossing to the Canary Islands is long and dangerous. Those leaving Senegal or Mauritania have a northerly voyage of 1,000 nautical miles to cross in order to reach their destination, though (as in this particular case) SAR forces may reach them much sooner. The hazards in the open Atlantic ocean are severe, and an estimated 10,000 people died on the crossing in 2024, according to aid group Caminando Fronteras. Spain's naval chief of staff, Admiral General Antonio Pineiro, recently emphasized the government's priority on search and rescue, rather than the pushback campaigns seen in parts of the Mediterranean. ""We're not here to fight the cayucos, but to help them,"" he told El Dia in an interview Friday.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 15:42:36

UK Parliament: Undersea Cables Vulnerable to Russian Attacks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-parliament-undersea-cables-vulnerable-to-russian-attacks,,22/09/2025 16:44:34,,"The UK Parliament is raising the red flag over the country’s ability to protect its critical but vulnerable undersea infrastructures from potential attacks by Russia, warning that the government is “too timid” in defending the assets. As more European nations enhance defense capabilities to protect undersea cables from attacks not only by Russia but also China, the UK government is coming under criticism for inadequate preparations to safeguard the infrastructures. In a report dubbed ‘Subsea telecommunications cables: resilience and crisis preparedness’, the UK Parliament reckons that although the UK’s vast undersea internet cable network does not face imminent threat, the country cannot afford a business-as-usual attitude owing to shifting geopolitical landscape. Tragically, while the possibilities of the UK’s infrastructure being targeted in a crisis remain elevated, Parliament is not confident the country is well-prepared to prevent such attacks or recover within an acceptable time period. Being an island nation that is almost entirely reliant on subsea cables to transmit data connecting it to the outside world, the UK remains vulnerable to situations where adversaries can often use civilian vessels to ‘accidentally’ attack the cables, in effect crippling major facets of the economy. Russia and China have repeatedly been accused of using proxy actors to sabotage subsea cables, particularly in the Baltic and Indo-Pacific regions. Concerns over the assets' safety is exacerbated by the fact that Moscow knows the locations of the cables. The report shows that around 64 undersea cables land in the UK, including 45 international systems. Around 50 of them are active, with some running through the English Channel. The fact that many cables cluster in a few locations around the UK and Ireland adds to their vulnerability. For instance, a vessel journeying from Land’s End towards Aberystwyth would cross around 20 cables. Another ship travelling down the Suffolk coastline would cross eight major cables in just a few hours. An incident involving the Russian spy ship Yantar loitering over the UK’s subsea infrastructure in January has heightened alert over possible malicious sabotage. During the incident, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset was deployed to shadow Yantar, closely watching every movement. The report warns that Russia is currently the primary threat actor capable of causing severe national disruption to the UK owing to its geographical proximity, capability mix and willingness to use military force and proxies to achieve political objectives. China, which possesses an increasingly capable array of maritime assets, is another major threat. While Beijing’s primary security focus remains on the Indo-Pacific region, possibilities of targeting UK assets remain high. “While our national connectivity does not face immediate danger, we must prepare for the possibility that our cables can be threatened in the event of a security crisis,” said Matt Western, Chair of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. He added that Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown every sign of wanting to test the soft underbelly of the NATO alliance. Undersea cables are a vital part of global internet infrastructure. Around 570 cables, usually run by private companies, carry 95 percent to 99 percent of the world’s intercontinental telecommunications data. To protect the UK’s undersea infrastructure, the report wants the government to buy a cable repair ship by 2030 to assure genuinely sovereign repair capacity. It also calls on the Royal Navy to establish a cadre of reservists and serving personnel to learn cable repair skills, to ensure cables could be repaired in a conflict scenario - a challenging order since the UK's maritime services face personnel shortages of their own.",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 21:27:42
The Sanctions Game,https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/the-sanctions-game-2,,22/09/2025 13:04:19,,"Here's an extreme example of globalization's tenacity and resilience: Russia, while subject to over 30,000 separate sanctions from nations around the world, has nevertheless exported $913 billion of oil and gas these past few years. The lion's share – $213 billion – was sold to the E.U., which is, now as before, Russia's biggest rival and customer. How can this happen? And why? I've said before that cargo, like water, will find its path from seller to buyer. When that cargo is critical, as it is in the global energy markets, imagine the political and economic pressure. Even if 30,159 sanctions stand in the way of a deal, it's likely to just happen. In ""No Coffee for You"" in the May/June 2024 edition, I noted that origin paperwork for the E.U.'s Supply Chain Act might be ""cut to fit."" And while I personally consider coffee, not crude, to be the true ""black gold,"" caffeine is small change compared to fossil fuels. WORKAROUNDS Buyers and sellers are relentless in their drive to find workarounds for their businesses. They've loaded their cargoes onto Moscow's 600-vessel ""shadow fleet,"" avoided port calls using ship-to-ship transfers of oil and gas in international waters, hidden vessel ownership behind spiderwebbed shell companies and management arrangements and gotten around origin rules by blending Russian and non-sanctioned fuels together. Yet the most audacious workaround is not a tactic, but a country: Turkey. Turkey offers a systematic, structured way to indirectly but legally do business with Russia – a way that economically benefits itself, Russia and the companies that fear violating sanctions. The reason is found in Turkey's tricky diplomatic history. Turkey is nominally a Western ally with European aspirations, but its interactions with the U.S. and E.U. have suffered from strategic frictions. In 2003, Turkey's parliament refused to let U.S. troops use Incirlik Air Base for the Iraq War. In 2016, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an was targeted by a military coup, the U.S. rejected Turkey's demand for the extradition of Fetullah Gülen, a critic of Erdo?an. During the Syrian civil war, the U.S. armed Kurdish fighters whom Turkey deemed terrorists. Then, more recently, Turkey purchased Russian S-400 missiles, which broke its military compatibility with NATO, of which Turkey is a member, and led to its exclusion from the F-35 fighter program. And throughout, Cyprus has blocked Turkey's E.U. membership due to its illegal 1974 invasion of the island. That list of issues is long and potentially crippling. Perhaps, then, the surprise is not that Turkey is looking for other dance partners but that bouncers haven't escorted it out? RUSSIAN/TURKISH COOPERATION Apart from a few difficult moments, Russia has over time deepened and broadened its connection to Turkey. Evidently, Russia and Turkey see enough strategic value in each other, or need each other enough, to mend rifts as they appear. In November 2015, for example, Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24 fighter jet during the Syrian civil war. Russian leader Vladimir Putin called it ""a stab in the back"" and imposed sanctions on Turkey. It looked like the end of the line. Yet within seven months, Erdo?an sent a letter of apology and, remarkably, the two countries emerged with stronger ties than before. A review of Turkish and Russian projects shows, overall, a broad spectrum of successful cooperation that helps sustain the relationship. Beginning with the Astana partnership between Turkey, Iran and Russia that paralleled U.N. efforts to broker a Syrian ceasefire, then continuing through the $23 billion TurkStream natural gas pipeline and the $20 billion Akkuyu nuclear plant, which Russia is building and maintaining, Turkey has leaned on Russia to reduce its dependence on the U.S. and E.U. In charting a diplomatic course between major powers, Turkey has recast Mediterranean trade by allowing Russia an outlet – geographically and economically – for its oil and natural gas. While doing so, Turkey has threaded the needle with its Western partners: The E.U. is Turkey's biggest trading partner, and NATO's Article 5 provides Turkey a security guarantee that Russia, especially now, cannot match. Turkey has implemented only sanctions that have been ratified by the U.N. Security Council, such as the ones targeting North Korea. So transactions with Russia that would be prohibited under U.S. or E.U. rules remain legal in Turkey. This has led to frustration for some and opportunity for others. Al-Arabiya quoted a senior U.S. Treasury official, who asked to remain anonymous: ""We've shared our concerns with the Turkish government and private sector and informed them of the significant risks of doing business with those we've sanctioned who are tied to Russia's war."" But Russia's ships passing through the Dardanelles and the Bosporus are protected under international treaty law by the 1936 Montreux Convention, at least during peacetime. And the otherwise permissive legal and diplomatic environment in Turkey encourages Turkish companies to acquire Russian business whenever possible. In 2023, for example, one company transported 49 million barrels of Russian oil, leading the U.K. to sanction it in February 2024. But its Russian oil operation didn't stop. It just moved down the hall. Three other Turkish companies with the same address and the same owners took over. A COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM The scale of Turkey's blending and re-exporting operations can be derived from statistics. Turkey's purchasing of Russian oil products went up 105 percent from 2023-2024, but its domestic oil consumption grew just eight percent – so it's not satisfying domestic demand. A refinery in Izmir, Turkey, reportedly processes 98 percent Russian crude, mostly from Lukoil. These refined oil products are labeled ""Turkish"" and become legal for export to the E.U. Similar loopholes are permitted by the E.U. when it comes to blending. In late 2023, one terminal in Ceyhan, Turkey received 26,923 tons of gasoil from Novorossiysk, then legally exported a similar quantity to a refinery in Greece ten days later, per the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Meanwhile, Turkish shipping lines have captured 55 percent of the Russian-Black Sea container market. International carriers abandoned this market, and Turkish firms expanded services specifically for Russian routes. One such line, launched in May 2022, offers its Novorossiysk Express Service to connect Russian ports with Turkish facilities and railways. And then there are the Turkish banks affiliated with the Credit Bank of Moscow. The most famous of these facilitated payments from buyers and transferred proceeds to Russian banking institutions after taking off its own commission. The comprehensive oil-for-credit scheme it was running legally bypassed traditional Western financial channels. In aggregate, Turkey has pursued an approach that has led to the establishment of other maritime clusters: a combination of clearinghouse services, financing, vessel management, port and terminal operations and shipyards for repair and refit. What is unique is the complete ecosystem that Turkey offers, which enables Russian trade to flow while Western competitors face compliance problems and legal obstacles. AN INDISPENSABLE SERVICE The key is that Turkey has cleverly maintained strategic leverage in both directions. Cyprus and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), both significant Russian gateways, have not fared as well. Cyprus is constantly pressured by the E.U. while the UAE, according to the Atlantic Council, has been gray-listed by the G7's Financial Action Task Force. Right now, Turkey is providing Russia and the E.U. with an indispensable service. But, as Charles de Gaulle said, ""The graveyards are full of indispensable men.""",Maritime Executive,22/09/2025 21:27:42

Gallagher & Vanguard Tech to Support Clients with Maritime Risk & Security,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/gallagher-vanguard-tech-to-support-clients-with-maritime-risk-security,,22/09/2025 23:18:26,,"[By: Gallagher] Gallagher has agreed a partnership with Vanguard Tech, a maritime insurance tech specialist. Through the agreement, Vanguard Tech will act as an appointed representative for Gallagher in the marine insurance market and Gallagher clients will benefit from its AI platform, monitoring technology and risk & security insight. Gallagher can now provide clients with a tool which helps to estimate risk and an in-depth, automated assessment on vessel safety at the outset and throughout its passage, meaning the likelihood of an incident is vastly reduced and insurers receive an added level of confidence in the risk, meaning better pricing can be negotiated. The joint initiative is particularly timely for marine clients given the current geopolitical unrest affecting major shipping routes and the potential increase in insurance costs that can be mitigated by Vanguard insurance technology and insights. Vanguard Tech continuously analyses live AIS streams, weather patterns, affiliation, sanctions, maintenance records and thousands of other data sets, to calculate an accurate risk profile for every voyage and vessel and presents it over a dedicated platform that continuously assesses risk in many forms. Its in-house analysts use sophisticated search methods scanning hundreds of online sources in multiple languages and draw from an extensive wealth of live information from sources at sea to ensure complete coverage of relevant information. In addition to providing underwriters with a risk assessment at the outset, Gallagher clients can also benefit from Vanguard Tech's Digital Guard technology during a voyage. This monitors the vessel 24/7 whilst at sea and proactively scans its planned passage for potential hazards, such as unfriendly ships that might be nearby, and will dynamically reroute the vessel away from danger giving additional peace of mind for the owners and the insurers. Angus Blayney, Marine Divisional Director at Gallagher said: ""This partnership enables us to provide a unique service to clients through combining our expertise with the very best of risk maritime technology innovation. This is much needed insight at a time where our marine clients are navigating a fast changing geopolitical landscape in combination with underwriters that are looking for additional assurances when providing cover. Vanguard Tech provides a variety of high quality services which allow our clients to mitigate their own risks, keeping both their seafarers and operations safe, whilst offering additional assurance to the insurance market."" Richard Podmore, Vice President of Vanguard Tech, added: ""At Vanguard Tech we help firms identify, assess, and mitigate potential hazards and threats associated with ship operations to minimise incidents and ensure the safety of personnel, cargo, the environment, and the vessel. We are thrilled to partner with Gallagher and bring our AI platform and the associated insurance benefits to our clients and to be representing the global broker in the maritime industry.""",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20

Sperry Marine Delivers Integrated Bridge Systems For Hydrogen-Powered Ships,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/sperry-marine-delivers-integrated-bridge-systems-for-hydrogen-powered-ships,,22/09/2025 22:52:22,,"[By: Sperry Marine] Sperry Marine, a global leader in navigation solutions for seagoing vessels, has been selected to supply the complete Integrated Bridge Systems for two highly innovative container vessels under construction for Samskip. Built by Cochin Shipyard Limited, the groundbreaking vessels will be delivered achieving zero-emission propulsion and ready for future autonomous navigation. The 135-meter length vessels are scheduled for delivery in 2027 to operate between Oslo Fjord and Samskip’s home port of Rotterdam, as part of a pioneering green corridor initiative. The two ships combined are expected to reduce CO? emissions by approximately 25,000 tons annually when operating in zero-emission mode using green hydrogen. At owner’s request, each IBS will feature open architecture that makes it possible to integrate emerging autonomous navigation solutions. Today, no industry-wide standards exist covering autonomous ship navigation. However, Sperry Marine’s modular design and open interfaces will allow shipowners to innovate at their own pace. The IBS package on board will include Sperry Marine’s new ‘self-adaptive’ NAVIPILOT 4500N autopilot, which dynamically adjusts to vessel characteristics and changing conditions, resulting in measurable fuel savings and reduced bridge workload. “Samskip’s level of ambition on emissions requires partners like Sperry Marine, with similar objectives for innovation and the willingness to invest in the future,” said Jeroen Hollebrands, Head of Newbuilding and Projects, Samskip Group. “These ships are a milestone for the maritime industry, delivering hydrogen fuel cells and autonomous-ready navigation as a clean and renewable technology.” “What sets this IBS apart is its open and flexible architecture, combined with Sperry Marine’s resilient sensor technology and robust cyber protection. This creates a secure and future-proof navigation platform, ready for today’s hydrogen powered operation and tomorrow’s autonomous services,” said Pascal Göllnitz, Sperry Marine’s Product Line Manager for Integrated Bridge Systems. Also on board will be Sperry Marine’s Advanced ARPA tracking, whose streams operate separately from radar video, meaning performance is unaffected by anti-clutter settings. As well as consistently reliable target tracking, even in difficult conditions, the system provides tracking ranges of 40NM to ensure early awareness among bridge teams. The full scope of supply includes Sperry Marine’s Secure Maritime Gateway cyber threat protection, and remote diagnostics and support. “Sperry Marine is proud to collaborate with Samskip and Cochin Shipyard Limited on this transformative project,” said Guy Millard, Managing Director Sperry Marine. “This contract demonstrates how our navigation technologies are sought out by the maritime industry’s true innovators in ship safety, efficiency, and sustainability.”",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20
Dubai’s National Industries Park Secures Over AED 1 Billion In New Projects,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/dubai-s-national-industries-park-secures-over-aed-1-billion-in-new-projects,,22/09/2025 22:47:50,,"[By: National Industries Park] National Industries Park (NIP), DP World’s industrial hub in Dubai, has secured more than AED 1 billion in new projects so far this year, underlining strong investor confidence in the emirate’s growing industrial base. Between January and September, NIP leased over 7 million square feet of land, with the majority allocated to greenfield projects that will fuel new manufacturing capacity. The surge in demand takes NIP’s tenant based past 400 companies, together supporting more than 24,700 jobs. New customers this year include Danube Building Materials, LT Foods Middle East and Trilogy Fab Trailers Manufacturing among others. The investments add to the park's strong performance in 2024, when new customer registrations nearly doubled year-on-year. Abdulla Al Hashmi, Chief Operating Officer, Parks & Zones, DP World GCC, said: “Nationwide value added in manufacturing is projected at AED 160 billion in 2025, with output rising steadily under supportive industrial agendas. NIP’s performance highlights Dubai’s position as a hub for advanced manufacturing and the strong flow of greenfield projects demonstrates investor confidence in our ability to help businesses scale quickly, creating jobs and driving industrial growth.” Demand is being driven by the construction sector, automotive, electronics and food manufacturing, as businesses expand to serve Dubai’s growing population and large-scale infrastructure projects. To support its expanding customer base, NIP is strengthening its customer-first approach through upgraded digital systems, a refreshed brand identity and targeted regional outreach to attract premium investments and drive sustainable growth. According to a 2023 Economic Impact Study conducted by Ernst & Young (EY), NIP contributed 17% of Dubai’s industrial output. With new facilities set to become operational, the park is expected to create more indirect jobs and accelerate manufacturing growth across the UAE. NIP forms part of DP World’s flagship assets in the UAE, including Jebel Ali Port and Jebel Ali Free Zone. Canada’s CDPQ and Saudi Arabia’s Hassana Investment Company hold equity stakes in the three assets, reflecting strong international investor confidence in Dubai’s trade and industrial ecosystem.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20
China's Navy Releases First Video of Electromagnetic Catapult Launches,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-navy-releases-first-video-of-electromagnetic-catapult-launches,,22/09/2025 22:23:30,,"For the first time, China's PLA Navy has released video footage of aircraft launch and recovery with a catapult aboard the new carrier Fujian, which leapfrogged steam technology and jumped straight to electromagnetic launch. The new carrier Fujian is currently operating in the South China Sea on a final shakedown cruise prior to its commissioning date. A newly-released video shows that at some point this year, it launched and recovered at least three different PLA Navy aircraft - the J-15T fighter, the J-35 stealth fighter and the KJ-600 airborne early warning plane. These are the three key components of its air wing. Three types of carrier-based aircraft, including J-15T, J-35 and KJ-600, completed catapult launch and landing training on board the PLANS Fujian for the first time this year, demonstrating the Fujian’s capability of electromagnetic catapult and recovery operations. pic.twitter.com/XATTs1yCtu Fujian is China's first catapult-equipped carrier, and adds significantly to the capabilities of the Soviet-designed Liaoning and Shandong. Both of these previous-generation carriers have a ski-jump ramp at the bow, an arrangement that lacks the accelerating force a catapult provides on a carrier's ultra-short runway. Launches performed from a ski-jump carrier are typically limited in fuel and weapons stores, restricting the combat range and capability of the air wing; however, as an incremental starting point towards modern carrier aviation, these two older vessels have provided China with invaluable training time for pilots and sailors. Fujian's launch system is superficially similar to the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford, the U.S. Navy's new $13 billion supercarrier, raising considerable speculation about the source of the engineering. The Chinese carrier is the first anywhere outside of the U.S. to incorporate this technology; unlike Ford, which houses two nuclear reactors to generate electricity for the launch system, Fujian is conventionally powered.

Royal Visit Marks Reopening of Lloyd’s Register London Headquarters,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/royal-visit-marks-reopening-of-lloyd-s-register-london-headquarters,,22/09/2025 22:06:58,,"[By: Lloyd's Register] Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal has officially reopened Lloyd’s Register’s Grade II* listed headquarters in central London following an extensive refurbishment. The reopening of the building, now officially renamed the Lloyd’s Register Building, took place during London International Shipping Week, marking a significant milestone in the building’s history and its future as a modern hub for maritime innovation and collaboration. Originally opened in 1901, the building has undergone a restoration to preserve its architectural heritage and will once again serve as the London headquarters for Lloyd’s Register Group and Lloyd’s Register Foundation, providing a modernised workspace for colleagues, clients, and partners. During the visit, The Princess Royal had the opportunity to explore the broader themes of maritime heritage and innovation. The Princess Royal also had a tour of the historic building and was introduced to SHE SEES - a powerful initiative that reimagines maritime history through the lens of women. The project highlights untold stories through striking portraits and collaborative storytelling, offering a fresh perspective on the sector’s past, present, and future. Lloyd’s Register has a long association with the Royal Family. HRH The Prince of Wales, Albert Edward, visited in 1904 and HRH The Late Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, was the first person to be elected Honorary Member of the General Committee of Lloyd’s Register of Shipping. A formal painting of him is displayed in the General Committee room. Nick Brown, CEO of Lloyd’s Register, said: “We were honoured to welcome Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal to officially reopen our historic London headquarters. The reopening of our building is more than a return to a historic home; it is a statement of our commitment to shaping the future of maritime. This building will be a hub where heritage meets innovation, a place where our colleagues, clients and partners can collaborate to tackle the industry’s greatest challenges and opportunities.” Ruth Boumphrey, Chief Executive of Lloyd’s Register Foundation, said: “Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal’s visit marks a wonderful moment in celebrating our building’s rich maritime heritage and long history, while highlighting the vital work the Foundation is doing to help the global community focus on tackling the world’s most pressing safety and risk challenges.” To close the visit, The Princess Royal rang the bell and unveiled a plaque to mark the reopening. In addition, she was presented with a copy of the rigging and profile plan for the Royal Yacht Britannia, as produced by John Brown & Co, c1952, plus a copy of the SHE SEES book.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20

Singapore Maritime Foundation Inks Four MOUs for One Mission,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/singapore-maritime-foundation-inks-four-mous-for-one-mission,,22/09/2025 21:57:22,,"[By: The Singapore Maritime Foundation] The Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) has signed four Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) in recent months with partners across the maritime ecosystem including Jurong Port, Oza Family Foundation, Singapore Shipping Association and Swire Shipping. These collaborations further expand access to scholarships, internships, and industry exposure for Singapore’s young talent of all backgrounds — underscoring SMF’s commitment to building a future-ready workforce for Maritime Singapore. The background of each MOU is as detailed: Jurong Port (July 2025) Under a three-year MOU starting in 2025, Jurong Port will award four MaritimeONE scholarships and one MaritimeONE internship annually. This initiative, managed by SMF, allows tertiary students to deepen industry knowledge and develop skills through structured programmes, while offering firsthand exposure to one of the world’s leading multipurpose ports. Oza Family Foundation (August 2025) SMF signed an MOU with Mr. Punit Oza from the Oza Family Foundation to contribute one MaritimeONE scholarship annually from 2025 to 2027. This partnership highlights the role of private philanthropy in nurturing talent and enabling deserving students to pursue maritime studies and careers. Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) (August 2025) Through its three-year MOU with SMF, SSA will contribute three to four MaritimeONE scholarships annually from 2025 to 2027. SMF will oversee scholarship administration and promotion, leveraging SSA’s industry network to reach more youths and showcase diverse opportunities in shipping. Swire Shipping (September 2025) SMF’s partnership with Swire Shipping from 2025 to 2027 will connect students with industry opportunities through one MaritimeONE Scholarship and two Internships offered annually.

Pronav Welcomes First FSRU to its Managed LNG Fleet,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/pronav-welcomes-first-fsru-to-its-managed-lng-fleet,,22/09/2025 21:48:36,,"[By: Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement] Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) is expanding its fleet portfolio and has for the first time taken on the technical management of a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU). The vessel is managed by Pronav, BSM’s highly specialised Ship Management Centre which exclusively operates large-scale LNG carriers from its Hamburg-based office. The 2019 built FSRU ‘Turquoise P’, owned by Pardus Energy Ltd., is stationed at the Etki Liman LNG terminal in the Turkish Aegean Sea, near Izmir. It has a length of 294 m and a cargo capacity of 170,000 cbm. “This is a milestone for Pronav and the entire Schulte Group. We are proud that our many years of expertise in ship management of LNG carriers and our flawless safety record have enabled us to take on the technical management of ‘Turquoise P’,” says Martin Roolvink, Managing Director of Pronav. He emphasises that the LNG segment is subject to the most demanding industry requirements and that the highest safety and quality standards are key in LNG ship management. FSRUs are ship-based facilities that receive, store, and convert liquefied natural gas back into gaseous natural gas for delivery to shore. The Etki Liman LNG terminal, connected to Türkiye’s national gas grid, is of major importance in supplying energy to the Izmir region, especially during times of peak demand or seasonal fluctuations. The unconditional availability and reliability of the facility is therefore a top priority. There are currently just over 50 FSRUs in operation worldwide and only very few are managed by third-party ship managers. Pronav is highly recognised by energy majors, LNG charterers and LNG terminals around the world for its operational safety, quality, reliability, and efficiency. Pronav has more than 25 years’ experience in the technical management and crewing of different types of LNG carriers, such as the latest generation equipped with dual-fuel engines (MEGI & X-DF) but also slow-speed diesel with 100% relic plants (Q-Flex) as well as conventional steam vessels (both with Moss-type and membrane tanks).",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20
Report: UK's Seafaring Community is in Decline,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-uk-s-seafaring-community-is-in-decline,,22/09/2025 20:17:00,,"The United Kingdom is on track for a massive decline in the number of its homegrown seafarers over the next decade and a half owing to rising challenges, which is also making the country struggle to recruit the next generation of seafarers. A new report commissioned by the Maritime Charities Group (MCG) shows that due to burnout and safety concerns, the UK’s diverse seafaring community is vanishing at an unprecedented rate. Currently, the community - defined as active seafarers, former seafarers, and dependent children - is estimated at more than half a million. By 2040, the community is projected to decline by 40 percent to around 300,000. In an extreme scenario, projections indicate a substantial 75 percent decrease to as low as 131,000. The future is gloomy for the community of the UK's active seafarers, which is expected to decrease by approximately six percent from 35,000 to 33,000 - or even as low as 23,000, in an extreme scenario. This would mean a loss of one in three seafarers. According to the report - based on a survey of hundreds of seafarers and their families - the strains that come with the job are the main contributing factors for the declining numbers. For instance, two out of five seafarers believe their vessels are unsafe due to lack of crew, while only one in three agree that they receive adequate shore leave. While on duty in the high seas for weeks and even months, 40 percent of seafarers reported that they do not get enough sleep onboard. Other factors like lack of social interaction and workplace bullying are also a persistent challenge. The declining numbers of seafarers, coupled by the challenges to recruit, are a major worry for the UK’s shipping industry, which contributes $22 billion in gross value to the national economy annually. Its maritime sector directly employs more than 98,000 people at sea and on shore in roles including cargo, fishing, ferries, superyachts, cruise ships and workboats, and also supports 728,000 jobs. Seafarers handle 90 percent of the country’s traded goods and support the Royal Navy via the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, as well as crewing cruise ships, ferries and more. Many more are employed in the commercial fishing industry. “If seafaring communities start to disappear, it will get harder and harder to restore them and to attract the next generation into vital seafaring careers,” said Tim Slingsby, MCG chair. To safeguard the UK’s seafarers’ community, the MCG wants maritime welfare charities to take urgent action, including reviewing eligibility criteria to expand the number of seafarers they can support, and working with policymakers to ensure standards on seafarer safety and wellbeing.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20
Shadowy Special Operations Ship Spotted off Venezuela,https://maritime-executive.com/article/shadowy-special-operations-ship-spotted-off-venezuela,,22/09/2025 18:56:33,,"The U.S. military is building up a growing force of naval and aviation assets within striking distance of Venezuela, prompting speculation about the administration's plans - and its current activities. It is already carrying out drone strikes on drug-running boats linked to Venezuelan smuggling groups, and a rare vessel sighting in the region suggests that more gray-zone kinetic operations may be in the works. The vessel in question is an open secret. U.S. Military Sealift Command operates an 11,000 dwt cargo ship called Ocean Trader, which began life as a European ro/ro ferry. The RFP for its procurement included requirements fitting a special operations sea base: landing capacity for heavy helicopters, accommodations for 160 supernumeraries for 45 days, underway replenishment capability, an onboard SCIF, machine gun mounts, and launch and recovery capacity for jet skis and RIBs. After 12 years in Navy service, this modified merchant ship still wears its original white livery, but is never spotted working cargo, never inspected by port state control officials and never broadcasts its position on AIS (since 2017). Previous in-person sightings suggest that Ocean Trader's name and flag state are not marked on her stern, and her IMO number is displayed in unusually small text. On Sunday, open-source researcher MT Anderson spotted Ocean Trader's characteristic hull shape, size and color in satellite imaging of an area southwest of St. Kitts. The last sighting of the vessel was off Bahrain in May 2025, suggesting that Ocean Trader got under way for Venezuela well in advance of current developments. Is a secretive US special ops 'mothership' operating in the Caribbean? New satellite imagery raises questions.Analysis of Sentinel 2 imagery from September 20, 2025, shows a vessel with a highly unique fore and aft superstructure almost identical to the MV Ocean Trader, a... pic.twitter.com/Rr1rgKZu1G Other analysts have confirmed that the appearance of the ship in MT Anderson's satellite imaging conforms closely to previous known images of Ocean Trader. The Ocean Trader is usually spotted near hot spots for special operations activity, like Somalia. Her presence off Venezuela raises questions about her current mission set, as well as any future plans for her use. The vessel is the stealthiest element of a growing armada in the area, to include the destroyers USS Stockdale, USS Sampson and USS Jason Dunham; cruiser USS Lake Erie; LCS USS Minneapolis-St. Paul; the amphibs USS Iwo Jima, USS Fort Lauderdale, and USS San Antonio; and attack sub USS Newport News. The administration has been ratcheting up pressure on the government of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, and the accumulation of military capabilities in the Caribbean is perceived by many analysts as a signaling exercise - not a preparation for an invasion, which would require far more troops. The buildup is ""a clear signal to Nicolas Maduro that this administration is growing serious about accomplishing either regime or behavioral change from Caracas,"" Adm. James G. Stavridis, former chief of US Southern Command, told the New York Times. ""Gunboat diplomacy is back, and it may well work.""",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20
Federal Judge Rules Against Trump Administration on Wind Farm Shutdown,https://maritime-executive.com/article/federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administration-on-wind-farm-shutdown,,22/09/2025 17:46:15,,"A federal court in D.C. has ruled in favor of Orsted in a lawsuit against the Interior Department, allowing the wind farm developer to resume construction at the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island. The ruling is a small setback for the Trump administration's oft-repeated goal of bringing an end to the U.S. wind energy industry. In a statement, Orsted confirmed that it plans to resume construction as quickly as possible, and that it will keep negotiating with the Trump administration on a comprehensive solution to the dispute. The project is 80 percent finished and approaching operation; federal interruption of a fully-permitted energy project of any kind is nearly unprecedented, especially so near to completion of construction. But the Department of the Interior argued that Orsted had not followed the rules of its construction and operations permit, notably a requirement to work with the U.S. Navy on deconfliction of impact on its operations. Wind farms do affect navigability for submarines and surface craft, but these conflicts were previously addressed during permitting. Orsted noted that the project had already gone through a complete national security review in 2023, prior to final federal approval. ""Today’s decision allowing work to resume on Revolution Wind is welcome news for the hundreds of skilled workers who can now return to their jobs while the legal process continues,"" said Liz Burdock, head of the ocean energy industry group Oceantic Network. ""This Made in America energy project is putting Americans to work building reliable, affordable power to communities across New England that desperately need it."" While Orsted may have won a district-court victory, the pressure on developers is intense and is certain to continue. The Trump administration has stood up a powerful cabinet-level task force to review all wind farm permits, following the president's pledge that ""we don't allow windmills, we don't allow any windmills to go up."" ""We now have an interdepartmental coalition, a team, which is Doug Burgum and Howard Lutnick and Chris Wright and Pete Hegseth are all working on this. We're all working together on this issue,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy told Reuters last month, referring to the Secretaries of the Interior, Commerce, Energy and Defense (respectively).",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 04:28:20

Why is the World's Biggest Inland Sea Shrinking?,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/why-is-the-world-s-biggest-inland-sea-shrinking,,23/09/2025 02:22:06,,"[By Simon Goodman] Once a haven for flamingos, sturgeon and thousands of seals, fast-receding waters are turning the northern coast of the Caspian Sea into barren stretches of dry sand. In some places, the sea has retreated more than 50 kilometers. Wetlands are becoming deserts, fishing ports are being left high and dry, and oil companies are dredging ever-longer channels to reach their offshore installations. Climate change is driving this dramatic decline in the world’s largest landlocked sea. Found at the boundary between Europe and Central Asia, the Caspian Sea is surrounded by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan, and sustains around 15 million people. The Caspian is a hub for fishing, shipping, and oil and gas production, and is of rising geopolitical importance as it sits where the interests of global superpowers meet. As the sea shallows, governments face the critical challenge of maintaining industries and livelihoods, while also protecting the unique ecosystems that sustains them. I’ve been visiting the Caspian for more than 20 years, working with local researchers to study the unique and endangered Caspian seal, and support its conservation. Back in the 2000s, the far north-eastern corner of the sea was a mosaic of reed beds, mudflats and shallow channels that teemed with life, providing habitats for spawning fish, migrating birds, and tens of thousands of seals that gathered there to moult in the spring. Now these remote wild places we visited to catch seals for satellite tracking studies are dry land, transitioning to desert as the sea retreats, and the same story is playing out for other wetlands around the sea. This experience parallels that of coastal communities, who year by year are seeing the water recede away from their towns, fishing wharves and ports, leaving infrastructure stranded on newly-dry land, and the people fearful for the future. A sea in retreat The level of the Caspian Sea has always fluctuated, but the scale of recent change is unprecedented. Since the turn of the current century, water levels have declined by around 6cm per year, with drops of up to 30cm per year since 2020. In July 2025, Russian scientists announced the sea had dropped below the previous minimum level recorded during the era of instrumental measurements. During the 20th century, variations were due to a combination of natural factors and humans diverting water to use for agriculture and industry, but now global warming is the main driver of decline. It might seem inconceivable that a body of water as large as the Caspian could be at risk, but in the hotter climate the rate of water entering the sea from rivers and rainfall is reducing, and is now being outstripped by increased evaporation from the sea surface. Even if global warming is limited to the Paris agreement target of 2°C, water levels are predicted to fall up to ten meters compared to the 2010 coastline. With the current global trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, the decline could reach 18 meters, which is about the height of a six-story building. Because the northern Caspian is shallow – much of it only around five meters deep – small decreases in depth mean huge losses of area. In recent research, colleagues and I showed that even an optimistic ten-meter decline would uncover 112,000 square kilometers of seabed – an area larger than Iceland. What’s at stake The ecological consequences would be dramatic. Four out of ten ecosystem types unique to the Caspian Sea would disappear completely. The endangered Caspian seal could lose up to 81% of its current breeding habitat, and Caspian sturgeon would lose access to critical spawning habitat. As in the Aral Sea disaster, where another massive lake in Central Asia almost entirely disappeared, toxic dust from exposed seabed would be released, with serious health risks. Millions of people are at risk of displacement as the sea recedes, or face highly degraded living conditions. The sea’s only link to the global shipping network is through the delta of the Volga River (which flows into the Caspian) and then via an upstream canal to the Don River for connections to the Black Sea, Mediterranean and other river systems. But the Volga is already struggling with reduced water depth. Ports like Aktau in Kazakhstan and Baku in Azerbaijan need dredging just to keep operating. Similarly oil and gas companies are having to dredge long channels to their offshore facilities in the north Caspian. Already the costs of protecting human interests are in the billions of dollars and are only set to grow further. The Caspian is central to the “middle corridor,"" a trade route linking China to Europe. As water levels fall, shipping loads must be reduced, costs rise, and settlements and infrastructure risk being stranded tens or even hundreds of kilometers from the sea. A race against time Countries around the Caspian are having to adapt, relocating ports, and dredging new shipping lanes. But these measures risk conflicting with conservation goals. For instance, there are plans to dredge a major new shipping channel across the “Ural saddle” of the north Caspian. But this is an important area for seal breeding, migration and feeding, and will be a vital area for the adaptation of ecosystems as the sea recedes. Since the rate of change is so rapid, traditional fixed boundary protected areas risk becoming obsolete. What’s needed is an integrated, forward-looking approach to planning across the whole region. If the areas ecosystems will need to adapt to climate change are mapped and protected now, planners and policymakers will be better able to ensure future infrastructure projects avoid or minimize further damage. To do this, Caspian countries will have to invest in biodiversity monitoring and planning expertise, all while coordinating action across five different countries with different priorities. Caspian countries are already recognizing the existential risks, and have begun to form intergovernmental agreements to address the crisis. But the rate of decline may outstrip the pace of political cooperation. The ecological, climatic and geopolitical importance of the Caspian Sea means its fate ultimately matters far beyond its receding shores. It provides a key case study in how climate change is transforming major inland water bodies across the world, from Lake Titicaca to Lake Chad. The question is whether governments can act fast enough to protect both the people and nature of this rapidly changing sea. Simon Goodman is a Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology at University of Leeds.

Container Rates Plummet on China-U.S. Routes,https://maritime-executive.com/article/container-rates-plummet-on-china-u-s-routes,,23/09/2025 01:58:32,,"International container rates have plummeted over the past few weeks, pulled down by cooling economic signals in the West and the onset of the Golden Week holiday in China. The core Shanghai-U.S. West Coast route saw rates drop by 31 percent week-on-week, down to just $1,600 per FEU. The all-water route from Shanghai to the East Coast fell to $2,500 per FEU, down 23 percent week-on-week. Rates from Shanghai to Europe dropped by nine percent to $1,000 per TEU, a favorable price per ton-mile for the shipper. Falling demand and falling rates are typically a sign of blanked sailings ahead. ""If demand drops, so should capacity if you are to at least underpin the rates and prevent them from dropping. And if we look on the capacity side, the carriers are still busy blanking sailings,"" said Vespucci Maritime analyst Lars Jensen in a podcast released Monday. ""We are now at a point where roughly 14% have been pulled out of the Pacific, 17% out of Asia and Europe."" Part of the drop on U.S. routes may be a response to tariffs on China, which currently sit at 30 percent-plus and will automatically ratchet up further on November 10 (unless Beijing and Washington negotiate another agreement). Part may also be consumer sentiment: most Americans expect the unemployment rate to rise within a year, and about one-fifth think it's possible to lose a job within five years, according to the latest data from University of Michigan's benchmark survey. ""This month’s easing in economic views was particularly strong among lower and middle income consumers,"" University of Michigan consumer survey director Joanne Hsu said in a mid-September update. ""Trade policy remains highly salient to consumers, with about 60% of consumers providing unprompted comments about tariffs during interviews, little changed from last month.""",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 09:31:21
Maritime Revival?,https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/maritime-revival,,23/09/2025 01:11:55,,"In February, a draft executive order was leaked that outlined a plan for the government to address the Navy and commercial shipbuilding problems as well as the inadequate supply of U.S. mariners. The effort was promoted as addressing a national security issue. The Administration's efforts were mirrored in the bipartisan congressional SHIPS for America Act. To expedite its passage, the bill was divided into two parts, eliminating the need for the complete bill to be considered by two separate legislative committees. Instead, these committees would only need to deal with provisions related to their jurisdiction, thereby speeding up the process. Trump's April Executive Order established the White House Shipbuilding Office under the National Security Council. Recently, the NSC underwent reorganization and downsizing. The head of the Shipbuilding Office departed for an industry position, and staff members either were transferred to other positions or resigned. The staff-less office now operates under the Office of Management and Budget. We're reminded of the poor performance of the shipbuilding industry by the latest data from the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. The 2024 data showed that the global shipbuilding industry delivered 71.7 million tons of new oceangoing ships. It included 30,782 tons built in the U.S. That represented four hundredths of a percent of the total tonnage built by the world's shipyards. This was not four percent or even four-tenths of a percent. It was just four hundredths of a percent! The new tonnage represented a 1,469-vessel expansion of the world's merchant fleet. According to the UNCTAD data, the U.S. merchant fleet increased by just six ships. If we exclude ships in the ""Other Types"" category, the global fleet increased by 1,128 ships while the U.S. fleet remained unchanged. A review of historical fleet data shows that 2024 was not an anomaly. Between 2011 and 2025, the global fleet increased by 35 percent. However, the U.S. fleet only increased by just 2.7 percent. Is it possible the U.S. didn't need additional vessels? The UNCTAD data on global maritime trade suggests otherwise. From 2011 to 2023, global cargo volumes loaded and discharged increased by 22.5 percent while total U.S. maritime trade grew by 16.2 percent. That would certainly justify a larger U.S. fleet. Equally interesting is the fact that between 2011 and 2023, the volume of U.S. cargo loaded increased by 58.8 percent while the amount discharged declined by 16.1 percent. Excluding the impact of the U.S. becoming a major oil exporter, U.S. cargo growth was 24.2 percent. Overall, the UNCTAD data support the President's efforts to revive the U.S. shipbuilding and merchant marine industries. During World War II, the U.S. created a powerful industry that delivered ships in months, not years, and enabled the U.S. and its allies to secure victory in the European and Pacific theaters. Over time, however, the shipbuilding and maritime industries were allowed to atrophy. How did this happen? The downsizing of the U.S. defense industry following the end of the Cold War contributed to the atrophy. Moreover, military officials indicated to defense supplier executives that spending would continue to decline. Therefore, it made sense for the industry to contract, which it did through mergers and company acquisitions. A shrinking industry, facing reduced defense spending, focused on cutting costs and eliminating inefficient businesses. That meant targeting the closing of shipyards that made large, oceangoing military and merchant ships. Furthermore, there was little incentive to invest in operating shipyards because they faced a shrinking market. That tide may be turning. Earlier this month, Canada's Davie Shipbuilding announced that it aims to acquire shipyard assets in Galveston and Port Arthur, Texas, from Gulf Copper & Manufacturing. Davie's goal is to enter the market to build icebreakers that the President has ordered. As Davie's CEO, James Davie, said, the company's goal is ""to make Texas a world-class hub for American icebreaker and complex ship production."" Davie's involvement in building U.S. icebreakers would expand with the acquisition, given its ownership of Helsinki Shipyard in Finland, one of the world's leading builders of icebreakers. It also owns a shipyard in Quebec that specializes in icebreakers. Last July, the Biden Administration negotiated a deal with Canada and Finland, known as the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort Pact, which allowed the parties to share their expertise. The Trump Administration reaffirmed this collaboration in March. By utilizing existing icebreaker designs and construction expertise, costs can likely be reduced. Perhaps more importantly, the construction experience might lead to shorter delivery times. Davie hopes to complete the Gulf Copper acquisition later this summer. U.K.-based marine industrial group Inocea owns Davie. It plans to invest $1 billion in modernizing and expanding the Texas shipyards. The move by Davie follows the December 2024 acquisition of Philly Shipyard, controlled by Aker Capital, by Hanwha Systems and Hanwha Ocean Co. of South Korea for $100 million. Hanwha Ocean was formerly known as Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company. It's the only company that has built submarines for the Korean Navy. It's also built five Tide-class fleet oilers for the U.K. Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Hanwha is one of Korea's top three shipbuilders. Last spring, the company completed a six-month refurbishment of a U.S. Navy vessel at its shipyard in Geoje, Korea. The need for the U.S. Navy to utilize a foreign shipyard for vessel refurbishment is a sign of the woeful state of the domestic shipbuilding and repair industries. David Kim, Hanwha Philly Shipyard's new CEO, said, ""Hanwha Philly Shipyard begins an exciting new chapter today. We plan to grow and build on a long tradition of success by expanding production using advanced technologies and supporting the national revitalization of U.S. shipyards."" He went on to further explain the company's plan: ""We intend to do that by pushing the boundaries of shipbuilding by combining people with technology to build best-in-class vessels."" Recently, Hanwha Philly Shipyard announced a contract to construct a Jones Act-compliant LNG carrier for a Hanwha Group subsidiary, with an option for a second vessel. According to reports, the vessel is expected to cost $250 million, which is an attractive price for a sophisticated ship like an LNG carrier. Hanwha is a world leader in LNG ships and will provide a technology transfer arrangement with Philly Shipyard. Notably, this will be the first U.S.-built LNG carrier in 45 years. Established in 1997 following the closure of the U.S. Navy's Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philly Shipyard has delivered around 50 percent of all large, oceangoing U.S. Jones Act-compliant commercial ships since 2000. These ships have primarily been tankers and container ships. It recently completed a second National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) for the U.S. Maritime Administration, establishing the shipyard's credentials as a prime maritime supplier. NSMVs are used as training ships for U.S. maritime schools. The first vessel was delivered to the State University of New York Maritime College last year. The second ship will go to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. Hanwha Group acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Australian shipbuilder Austal Ltd. for 183.3 million Australian dollars ($117 million) in March. This purchase followed an offer to buy Austal USA's shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, for $662 million, which was scuttled partly due to national security concerns over Korean ownership of a yard becoming more involved in U.S. submarine construction. Austal specializes in building both commercial and naval vessels as a global defense prime contractor. It's one of four major suppliers to the U.S. Navy and has built a surface warfare combatant ship, the Independence-Class Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). While headquartered in Australia, Austal operates shipyards in Alabama and Western Australia. It will be interesting to see the Hanwha Group's next moves in light of its acquisition of Philly Shipyard and its investment in Austal. One wonders whether the uncertain fate of Trump's shipbuilding office and congressional inaction on the SHIPS Act will discourage further foreign investment in domestic shipyards. The actions of Hanwha and Davie signal that maritime capital understands the serious condition of the U.S. shipbuilding and repair industries as well as what appears to be a commitment by the Trump Administration to revive the domestic maritime sector. Navigating foreign policy and national security issues by foreign shipbuilders raises questions about the speed of the U.S. maritime revival. However, the UNCTAD data confirm both the challenges and opportunities awaiting policymakers and companies seeking to revive the maritime industry.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 09:31:21
King Charles Commissions New Royal Navy Attack Sub,https://maritime-executive.com/article/king-charles-commissions-new-royal-navy-attack-sub,,23/09/2025 00:54:14,,"After 12 years of construction, the Royal Navy is celebrating the commissioning of another of its most advanced hunter-killer submarines, this time with a royal welcome. The HMS Agamemnon (S123), built at a cost of $2 billion, was commissioned at the BAE Systems’ yard in Barrow-in-Furness by King Charles III in a ceremony that departed from naval tradition. The King read the commissioning warrant, an act that is typically performed by the Fleet Commander. Following the commissioning, the 7,400 tonnes nuclear-powered boat that is 97 meters long is expected to complete her final tests and commissioning program before leaving Barrow for sea trials. Nicknamed ""Awesome Aggie,"" the boat becomes the sixth of seven Astute-class submarines built for the Royal Navy over the past quarter of a century. Once fully operational, she will be based at the HM Naval Base Clyde, joining her five sister submarines that are already in service. The contract for Agamemnon was awarded in 2010, with her keel laid in 2013 marking the beginning of a 12-year construction period, which BAE Systems has described as quite complex. She becomes the sixth Royal Navy vessel to carry the name taken from the Greek king from the Trojan Wars going back to the late 18th century. Described as the most advanced hunter-killer, Agamemnon is expected to carry out a number of important roles from covert surveillance, tactical strikes to protecting critical underwater infrastructure owing to her advanced weaponry that includes the spearfish heavyweight torpedo and the Tomahawk Block IV land-attack missile, which has a range of some 1,000 miles. The Tomahawk IV has a longer range but can also be re-directed at a new target mid-flight. It can also beam back images of the battlefield to other assets. The UK says the boat will be pivotal to the country’s national security going into the second half of the 21st Century. “HMS Agamemnon is a product of stealth, equipped with world-leading sensors and is crewed by a highly-trained and dedicated crew. Together, they form a formidable capability, vital to protecting the United Kingdom’s security interests and supporting our global responsibilities,” said Commander David Crosby. Crosby is taking over Agamemnon’s command, having commanded her three older sister boats namely Astute, Artful and Anson. Apart from the commissioning of Agamemnon, the event also marked the steel cutting for the fourth and last Dreadnought-class submarine, HMS King George VI, that is also being built by BAE Systems. The boats, due to enter service from the early 2030s, are the replacement for the Vanguard-class submarines. King Charles also visited Barrow Town Hall to bestow Royal Port status on the town in honor of its 120-year history as the home of UK submarine construction. Two boats, the final Astute-class submarine Agincourt and Dreadnought are currently under construction in the gigantic Devonshire Dock Hall, which dominates the Barrow townscape.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 09:31:21
X-Press Feeders Declines to Pay Sri Lankan Court Judgment,https://maritime-executive.com/article/x-press-feeders-declines-to-pay-sri-lankan-court-judgment,,23/09/2025 00:45:10,,"X-Press Feeders has declined to pay an initial judgment ordered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for damages from the loss of the XPress Pearl, which burned and sank off Colombo with disastrous effects in 2021. The first $250 million tranche is due on September 23, and if paid, it would more than double the amount that X-Press has paid out so far. In a statement Tuesday, the Singapore-based company said that it is ""unable to make payment at this stage, and it is still in talks with Sri Lankan authorities. ""While we respect the judicial process, the ruling leaves open the possibility of additional and potentially unlimited compensation. Any payment towards the judgement could set a dangerous precedent for how maritime incidents will be resolved in the future,"" said Shmuel Yoskovitz, Chief Executive Officer of X-Press Feeders. X-Press Pearl suffered a slow-rolling disaster on her final voyage in 2021. Several containers of nitric acid started leaking on deck, and the master sought a port of refuge. However, port officials at Hamad, Qatar and Hazira, India refused to allow the unloading of the leaking boxes. The container ship sailed onwards to Colombo, Sri Lanka, a voyage of some 1,000 nautical miles southeast from Hazira. On arrival off Colombo, a container on deck caught fire, but local authorities refused to allow XPress Pearl to berth for firefighting operations. The ship burned and sank, releasing acids, caustic soda, 9,700 tonnes of epoxy resin and 1,680 tonnes of plastic pellets into the water - the largest plastic spill in history. In July 2025, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court ruled in favor of local fishermen in an environmental-damage suit against X-Press Feeders, finding that X-Press had not fully informed the port of the unfolding catastrophe on board. The court set the value of the loss at $1 billion and gave the owner, charterer and agent one year to pay. The court's plan requires four $250 million installments, payable quarterly. All the money would be deposited in court-administered funds for compensation to the fishing community and for environmental remediation. X-Press Feeders took issue with the court's decision. “The court’s intent to lay all blame and liability on the vessel’s owners and operators is blatantly apparent in their judgment,” the firm said in a statement last month. ""[It has] effectively pronounced the vessel’s master and local agents guilty of criminal charges before their trials have concluded,"" referring to the parallel criminal case against X-Press Pearl's captain. In the new statement issued Tuesday, X-Press Feeders said that it sympathizes with local fishermen and is willing to work with local nonprofits and community organizations to provide compensation directly. It noted that all government claims approved by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation have already been paid out. Yoskovitz called for a court judgment that is ""substantiated, proportionate and consistent with international conventions.""",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 09:31:21
China's Victory Day Parade: A Tale of Two Audiences,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/china-s-victory-day-parade-a-tale-of-two-audiences,,23/09/2025 00:07:06,,"The twin messages from the spectacle that unfolded in Tiananmen Square on September 3 could not be missed. China’s military parade, watched over by Xi Jinping as he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Japan’s surrender in the Second World War, was carefully calibrated for distinctly different audiences at home and abroad. For domestic consumption, the parade served as a powerful reassurance during uncertain times, particularly around the economy. The helicopters flying above the display of military might carried banners proclaiming “Justice shall prevail”, “Peace shall prevail”, and “People shall prevail” as a promise that China’s rise remains inexorable despite Western containment efforts. Crucially, the parade allowed Xi to demonstrate that China isn’t isolated despite American pressure. The presence of 26 foreign leaders, down from the 30 who attended in 2015, still projected an image of diplomatic vitality. For Chinese citizens bombarded with news about trade restrictions and technology bans, seeing their president flanked by fellow world leaders was intended to offer comfort that China maintains meaningful international partnerships. The international messaging, however, operated on an entirely different frequency. The unprecedented public alignment of Xi, Putin, and Kim wasn’t subtle – it was calculated. This visual representation of what some analysts term the “axis of upheaval” sent an unmistakable signal that China has options beyond Western engagement. The timing, coming as US President Donald Trump pursues aggressive trade policies toward China, transformed the parade into a geopolitical statement about alternative world orders. The military hardware on display carried specific messages for different international audiences. The DF-61 intercontinental ballistic missiles spoke directly to American defense planners, while the Yingji-series hypersonic anti-ship missiles – tested against mock US aircraft carriers – delivered pointed warnings about China’s anti-access capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. The revelation of undersea drones and cyber warfare units signalled China’s commitment to asymmetric capabilities that could neutralize traditional American advantages. But not every message could be controlled. The conspicuous absence of Indian Prime Minister Modi, despite his presence in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, highlighted the parade’s politically charged nature. Japan’s reported efforts to discourage attendance, and the subsequent Chinese protest, underscored how competing historical narratives continue to shape contemporary regional dynamics. The subsequent invocation of shared wartime history suggests Beijing recognizes the need to balance its new alignments with maintaining workable relations with Washington. The parade sought to appeal to the Global South. By framing the event as anti-fascist rather than anti-Western, and by securing attendance from leaders across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, though not pursuing formal alliances as its principle, China positioned itself as leading a coalition of nations seeking alternatives to Western hegemony while maintaining its principle of non-alliance partnerships rather than formal military blocs. The presence of leaders such as Myanmar’s Min Aung Hlaing and Zimbabwe’s Emmerson Mnangagwa – both isolated by Western sanctions – reinforced China’s role as patron to regimes marginalized by the existing international order. Xi’s declaration that “the Chinese nation is never intimidated by any bullies” gave voice to the divergent messaging strategies. Domestically, this rhetoric taps into the narrative of China suffering centuries of humiliation, rallying nationalist sentiment around the Chinese Communist Party’s leadership. Internationally, it signals China’s willingness to confront what it perceives as American aggression, even at the risk of further deteriorating relations. Rather than seeking to reassure international audiences about China’s peaceful rise – the dominant narrative of the previous decade – Beijing now appears comfortable projecting strength even at the cost of heightened tensions. The prominence given to the DF-5C, alongside China’s public acknowledgement of its nuclear modernization after years of obfuscation, reflects China’s calculation that its economic leverage and military capabilities have reached a threshold where accommodation with the West is no longer essential. Yet this dual messaging strategy carries inherent risks. The domestic promise of inevitable triumph may prove difficult to sustain if China’s economic challenges deepen. Internationally, the explicit alignment with Russia and North Korea may accelerate the very containment China seeks to avoid, pushing fence-sitting nations towards American partnerships. Trump’s response, accusing the three leaders of “conspiring against the United States” while at the same time reaffirming his “very good relationship” with Xi, exemplifies the complex reactions Beijing’s assertiveness generates. This complexity deepened during Trump and Xi’s 19 September phone call, where both leaders emphasized that the United States and China had fought together as allies in the Second World War – a historical reminder that seemed to deliberately contrast with the 3 September parade’s display of alternative partnerships. The parade sought to portray China as unapologetically assertive abroad while reassuringly confident at home. Yet the subsequent invocation of shared wartime history suggests Beijing recognizes the need to balance its new alignments with maintaining workable relations with Washington. As Beijing continues navigating between these sometimes contradictory imperatives, the effectiveness of this messaging strategy will largely determine whether China’s rise continues to challenge or ultimately upends the existing international order. For policymakers observing from capitals worldwide, understanding these divergent messages – from parade-ground assertions of new partnerships to phone-call reminders of old ones – isn’t merely academic, it is essential for anticipating China’s future trajectory.

AmFELS is a full-service offshore shipyard specializing in rig repairs, refits and Jones Act newbuilds. The transaction valued the AmFELS yard at just $50 million on an as-is basis. The terms are highly favorable for Karpowership: the transaction is effectively owner-financed for 12 months, with Karpowership paying only $10 million down at closing and the $40 million balance one year later. The deal is subject to typical closing conditions, including transfer of the underlying Port of Brownsville land lease to Karpowership's name. Seatrium said in a statement that it plans to keep its engineering R&D centers and business offices on the Gulf Coast. The AmFELS-built Charybdis, delivered behind schedule and over budget, recently arrived off Virginia to enter service for Dominion Energy. The mega-WTIV will be installing wind turbines for Dominion, unless blocked by the Trump administration's new policy of shutting down offshore wind projects through regulatory action. The Trump administration has created a cabinet-level task force to review all wind farm permits, following the president's promise that as a matter of policy, ""we don't allow windmills, we don't allow any windmills to go up."" Charybdis was the most iconic project on AmFELS' books, but others remain, and Seatrium said that it was committed to completing that work by the end of 2025.",Maritime Executive,23/09/2025 21:30:25

Meyer Turku Secures Long-Term Building Agreement with Royal Caribbean,https://maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-turku-secures-long-term-building-agreement-with-royal-caribbean,,23/09/2025 23:20:00,,"Meyer Turk in Finland has secured a long-term agreement to build cruise ships for Royal Caribbean Group through 2036. The yard, which reports it has built 25 ships for Royal Caribbean since the mid-1990s, received a firm order for a fifth mega cruise ship of the Icon class as well as an additional option for a seventh ship of the class. Petteri Orpo, Prime Minister of Finland, said, “This new framework agreement is excellent news for Finland.” It was noted that each of the Icon class cruise ships, which are the largest in the world at approximately 250,000 gross tons and accommodating up to 7,600 passengers, represents more than $1 billion to the Finnish economy. Under the terms of the long-term framework agreement, Royal Caribbean exercised the option it took in the summer of 2024 for a fifth cruise ship of the class. The first two were Icon of the Seas (entered service in January 2024) and Star of the Seas (entered service in August 2025), with the third cruise ship, Legend of the Seas, having recently been floated out of the assembly dock for outfitting ahead of its summer 2026 maiden voyage. Assembly on the unnamed fourth ship of the class began this month for delivery in 2027. Royal Caribbean had options for the fifth and sixth ship and now adds an option for the seventh cruise ship, subject to exercising the option and financing. “With this framework agreement now signed, we announce our common plan for the next decade in cooperation with Royal Caribbean Group and other key partners to build more Icon class ships and drive the future of shipbuilding over the next decade,” said Casimir Lindholm, CEO of Meyer Turku. Royal Caribbean Group, the public parent company of the cruise lines, highlighted that the multi-year agreement strengthens its relationship with Meyer Turku, and “readies Royal Caribbean for a new, game-changing class of ship beyond Icon.” Royal Caribbean has talked in vague terms of a new class of cruise ship called “Discovery” that they are planning as a replacement for their older mid-size cruise ships. Details have not been announced on that class, but with this agreement, the company locks up building slots at one of the key shipyards for cruise ships. Most large cruise ships are built at either the Meyer yards in Germany and Finland, Fincantieri in Italy, or Chantiers de l’Atlantique in France. Meyer in Papenburg, Germany, has long-term agreements to build cruise ships for Disney Cruise Line and Carnival Cruise Line, while Fincantieri has committed its largest building slots to Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line, each of which has ordered cruise ships over the 200,000 gross ton mark. Meyer Turku has been rumored for more than a year to be in discussions with MSC Cruises to build a new class of mega cruise ships. Details have not been released, and the order has not been confirmed, but it was believed that MSC was discussing a cruise ship to be 265,000 gross tons or more. Royal Caribbean Group highlights that it currently has a pipeline of nine new cruise ships on order, including three Icons and a seventh Oasis class cruise ship being built in France. It also has orders in France for two Edge class cruise ships for Celebrity Cruises and two river cruise ships for Celebrity’s new river cruise operation. It is also building a second TUI LNG-fueled cruise ship at Fincantieri for the joint venture Mein Schiff. The company is expanding its offerings in ocean and river cruises, and also notes that it will add seven land-based destinations by 2028 as part of its efforts to build beach clubs and private ports to serve the cruise ships.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 04:37:14
Op-Ed: The Navy's Next Top Officer Needs to be Radical,https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-the-navy-s-next-top-officer-needs-to-be-radical,,23/09/2025 23:15:41,,"[By LT Chris Rielage] Navy thinkers have already laid the intellectual groundwork for aggressive change. Senior leaders now need to follow through with equally radical actions. It has been just under two years since the last Call for Notes to the New CNO, written for Admiral Lisa Franchetti – and most of those good ideas still hold true. Four different articles argued for aggressive changes to force design, shifting the fleet towards more, smaller, less manned ships. Three notes focused on the Navy’s personnel policy, arguing in different ways that how we man and train is not setting us up for victory. It should be cause for dismay that pieces written for the last CNO still reflect conversations that officers have in the wardroom and schoolhouse every day. There is a consensus opinion among junior officers – closest to tactics, closest to sailors, and with the least time being enculturated into the Navy – that what the Navy is doing right now is not working. We all know that the U.S. is lagging the PLA in numbers, industry, and weapons development. We watch our mass expenditure of exquisite missiles in the Red Sea, and Ukraine’s success with drones in the Black Sea, and know that these trends bode ill for the destroyers and carriers the Navy is used to relying on. Instead of personnel policy leading the way to reform, as it did in the 19th century and the interwar period, SWOs are still being told that legacy engineering qualifications are a priority over tactics. It is time for the core model of the U.S. Navy to change. When today’s lieutenants joined the Navy as midshipmen, they heard then-CNO Admiral Richardson tell us to “Read. Write. Fight.” Junior officers everywhere accepted the challenge, thinking and publishing fiercely about how to dramatically change the Navy. That generation was taught that there was a social contract between junior and senior officers: if junior officers thought and wrote brilliantly, the larger Navy would adopt the best of those ideas. It was clear what implementing aggressive change looked like – exemplified by the Marine Corps’ Force Design and then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hick’s Replicator Initiative. In the Marine Corps, it was even possible to draw a straight line from an influential series of articles written by junior officers, to the service-wide concept that Commandant Berger championed. The Navy has not matched that level of bold action. Administrative leaders in the Navy have a natural – even praiseworthy – instinct towards caution when dealing with billions of dollars and sailors’ careers. Caution has, however, gone too far. Today’s wardrooms know our promotion milestones, but not how we will win a war with China. A desire to mitigate bureaucratic risk has created battlefield risk. It is past time to change this. The fleet is hungry for radical changes – just look at the voracious demand for WTIs, one of the best of the Navy’s recent reforms, in every corner of the fleet. The ideas we need to implement already exist. They exist in other services; in the battlefield experience of Ukraine, Israel, and the Red Sea; and especially in the thousands of pages of ink spilled thoughtfully over the last decade. The problem is not charting what the new Navy should look like. The problem is acting on it. This is the moment to be radical – for Admiral Caudle to lean fully into the “C-Notes” and make once-in-a-generation changes to how the Navy thinks and works. It is time for the CNO to steer us to the boldest course, despite the risks – we cannot afford anything else right now.

Two Vessels Arrive to Help Grounded Freighter in Northwest Passage,https://maritime-executive.com/article/two-vessels-arrive-to-help-grounded-freighter-in-northwest-passage,,23/09/2025 22:40:14,,"Two vessels have arrived at the site of the grounding of the Thamesborg in the Northwest Passage, the ultra-remote maze of narrows and inlets north of mainland Canada. The freighter Thamesborg was en route from China to Quebec when it grounded in Franklin Strait, just southeast of Prince of Wales Island. Though the vessel suffered hull damage and is immobilized, there has been no pollution due to the grounding, and the crew are all safe. The icebreaking buoy tender Sir Wilfred Laurier was the first official response vessel on scene. An oceangoing tug, the Beverly M I, has joined the operation, along with the ice-class reefer ship Silver Copenhagen. The Copenhagen is uniquely suited to the task of lightering off Thamesborg's cargo: the vessel draws much less water, so it can get alongside the stricken bulker; and it can carry up to 4,000 tonnes at a time, enough to lighten the freighter for a refloat. Silver Copenhagen has attracted attention this year for its involvement in shipping Russian seafood from Murmansk to Norway. Russian fish products are not subject to sanctions in Europe, but given current levels of tension between Russia and the West, maritime trade in and out of the strategic Russian seaport receives extra scrutiny. Fleetmate Silver Dania was briefly detained in Tromso in January on the request of Latvian authorities, who suspected the ship of damaging a Baltic subsea cable during a previous voyage; the Dania was quickly released. There are known risks in taking the Arctic route from Asia to North America's east coast. The Northwest Passage has hazardous shoals, poor hydrographic charting and seasonal ice, and the region is prone to clogging with drifting floes. Shifting ice conditions can force ships into deviating from their voyage plan, raising the risk of grounding.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 04:37:14
ABS Plans to Test Out a Humanoid Robot for Classification,https://maritime-executive.com/article/abs-plans-to-test-out-a-humanoid-robot-for-classification,,23/09/2025 21:28:00,,"Houston-based class society ABS has announced a new collaboration with robotics company Persona AI to develop a humanoid robot for shipyard uses. Robotic systems offer a way to perform the same task with fewer workers, freeing up scarce personnel for other jobs. ABS' plan for this new technology is to use robotically-collected data for classification during ship construction, enabling remote survey techniques. The trial will help develop new class standards for the type and quality of data collected by robots. ""This marks a defining moment for the shipbuilding industry,” said Nic Radford, CEO and Co-Founder of Persona AI. “Partnering with ABS, the global authority on maritime standards, demonstrates that humanoid robotics are no longer a distant concept but on a path toward certified reality."" A shipyard is a challenging work environment, and doubly so for robots. As projects ebb and flow, the layout of the yard changes dynamically: staging areas and workspaces are constantly shifting as materials and partially completed blocks are moved through the facility. This bears little resemblance to assembly-line industries like auto manufacturing, where robotic arms and welders can be programmed to work on the same objects in the same sequence day after day. Robotic work in shipbuilding tends towards repeatable tasks, like CNC cutting and robotic panel welding. Humanoid robot applications are fewer, but are gaining traction - notably in Korea, where automation is a key part of the business model. HD Hyundai Samho is working with a German-made humanoid robot, Neura's 4NE1, an AI-powered system built to step in ""when skilled workers are hard to find"" for industrial environments. Neura says that it is a ""cognitive robot"" that can learn from its surroundings and navigate complex situations. Earlier in the year, HD KSOE announced a partnership Vazil Company and Persona AI - the same firm working with ABS - to create a humanoid welding robot. The first prototypes are due at the end of 2026, with plans for field testing and full commercial deployment in 2027.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 04:37:14
Leading the Way,https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/leading-the-way,,23/09/2025 19:07:55,,"Skilled mariners are the backbone of the merchant fleet, and they work tirelessly to keep commerce moving smoothly. But their skills don't simply appear. Years of sea time and high-quality training are essential to building talent. The top-paying jobs in shipping require intensive study early on and throughout the mariner's career. That means maritime training academies are a vital element in the success of the industry. Based on shipping's vastly-improved safety record, it's clear that rigorous STCW training and simulation are saving lives, cargo and money. HIGH-TECH EDUCATION Technology plays an important role in modern maritime education, making it both more accessible and more realistic. Online learning helps ratings and deck officers improve their skills and complete coursework at a distance, even while under way. Digital simulation gives cadets, mariners and pilots a way to push the limits of their skills under pressure without exposing them to real-world risk. Solent University's Warsash Maritime School in Southampton recognized the benefits of high-tech training early on and has been at the forefront for years. ""We pioneered the use of bridge, engine room and liquid cargo operations simulators,"" says Susie Smith, Warsash's Marketing Manager. ""Our specialist ship-handling training facility is the only one in the U.K. and one of only a few in the world."" In a U.K. first, Warsash is now rolling out a government-approved bridge simulation training program for all its new cadets. The 10-day simulator course will substitute for 30 days of sea time for budding mariners. In the U.S., the training academy MITAGS (a division of the Masters, Mates & Pilots Union) was an early adopter of simulation and prides itself on its advanced simulator services for cadets, marine pilots, port authorities and shipowners. ""All our simulators have been significantly upgraded this year with new computers driving them, new software, new projectors,"" notes Capt. Jon Kjaelruff, MITAGS's Director of Business Development. ""We invest continuously in not only equipment upgrades – having the best equipment out there – but also the most up-to-date models. We have a full-time staff who can fine-tune the ship models and the simulators as well as the operating areas."" MITAGS has found ways to bring simulation to new places. Working with its technology providers, it's developed VR headset systems and cloud-based simulation that can deliver a limited simulation session in any home or office. ""A big impediment in training is just the time and the travel cost,"" says Kjaelruff. ""If the technology can deliver training to where they are, people really like that."" For many mid-career officers, remote options are a game-changer. The American Maritime Officers' STAR Center, which provides courses for union members, has taken advantage of online learning to make life easier for AMO mariners. ""It's been very popular with the students,"" says Jerry Pannell, Director of Training at STAR Center. ""When they have to do required training for their upgrade, they want to do it in the most efficient way possible given that they are taking time off from their ship or using vacation time to do it."" At the Calhoun MEBA Engineering School (CMES), the training academy for members of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, technology is front and center. In addition to two bridge simulators for deck officer training, CMES' 700-acre campus has hands-on simulation for everything an engineer might encounter on board – from high-voltage electric propulsion to electronic control systems to LNG marine fuel systems. It's a well-resourced support system for America's oldest and fastest-growing maritime union. MAKING IT FUN Technology has also opened up new opportunities for basic safety and familiarization training. Drawing on behavioral research and the design cues of familiar cellphone apps, India's training tech company MarinePALS creates content that fits the needs of younger seafarers. This approach centers on concise, efficient videos inspired by YouTube and TikTok; interactive, game-like test-and-answer segments, and app engagement prompts that persuade the user to complete more content. All user activity on the app is tracked so that the company and the master can monitor each seafarer's progress. ""The younger generation needs everything to be available on their mobile phones, and the attention span of all people has reduced,"" says MarinePALS CEO Capt. Pradeep Chawla. To meet that reality, MarinePALS keeps its video content under seven minutes in length and delivers longer trainings as a ""Netflix series"" of seven-minute segments. Helpful in-app suggestions put the most relevant content in front of the viewer after each session. ""We hope to encourage not complete binge-watching, but at least if you go to one video, then maybe you will see two or three more,"" Chawla says. MarinePALS also creates custom gamified learning mini-courses in which the user has to interact with an image or 3D model of a shipboard environment – for example, identifying deficiencies in a shipboard inspection. The flag state of Bermuda is now using this tool to train its inspectors, says Chawla. With a gamified approach, ""You can have a competition with your colleague to see who can find more defects."" LEARNING AT SEA Technology has made maritime training more accessible, more sophisticated and more fun, but there's still no substitute for real sea time. That's one of the big draws for prospective students at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. By federal regulation, USMMA has access to two cadet berths on every vessel in the Maritime Security and Tanker Security Programs – the Maritime Administration's U.S.-flag incentive systems. Together with additional berths provided by Military Sealift Command and other operators, there's enough space to send every USMMA midshipman to sea on real merchant ships for a total of one year. While Sea Year is a proud tradition at Kings Point, America's state maritime academies have another option to offer: training ships, which are being replaced and upgraded under MARAD's National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) Program. The state schools' ships have had long and illustrious histories, but they're approaching the end of their service lives. For example, SUNY Maritime's TS Empire State VI was 60 years old when it retired in 2022, making it one of the oldest deep-sea vessels in the U.S. fleet. With yard-and-stay gear and steam propulsion, it no longer represented modern shipping technology. SUNY Maritime took delivery of MARAD's first NSMV, Empire State VII, in the fall of 2023. Since then, the brand-new ship has sailed to Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Portugal and Norway, among other destinations, providing hundreds of cadets with an opportunity to hone their skills at sea. The NSMV design is modern and attractive, perfect not just for training but also for recruiting. The second NSMV was delivered to Massachusetts Maritime Academy late last year and made its maiden voyage in January and February, calling in Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, South Carolina and Florida. During some of these port calls, the new TS Patriot State II provided open-house recruiting events for prospective students, serving as a mobile demonstration of what a career in shipping (and an education at Mass Maritime) would look like. POLICY OPPORTUNITIES The NSMV program has been a big success, and not by accident. MARAD hired TOTE Maritime to serve as an intermediary between itself and Philly Shipyard (now Hanwha Philly), thereby insulating the shipbuilder from the challenges of federal contracting. This kept down the cost per hull – $300 million, a fraction of the estimate of the Naval Sea Systems Command – and kept the work on track by preventing change orders. The five hulls are a $1.5 billion down payment towards the future of the state academies, but there are other ways that Washington could help, says MITAGS' Kjaelruff, especially if policymakers want to grow the U.S.-flag fleet. The SHIPS for America Act has generated a lot of interest in D.C. with its goal of adding 250 ships to the U.S. registry, and if it takes off there will be a need to train many more mariners. ""If you've added a new merchant ship, where do you find people to crew it?"" says Kjaelruff. ""For the training community, it would be a big step up in demand to prepare enough people to be on those vessels."" One viable option would be federal financial assistance to cover part of the cost of training for new recruits, both inside and outside the state academies. A forgivable loan program to help pay for tuition would go a long way toward bringing new people into the business, Kjaelruff adds. Their education would cost less up front, and if they completed a time obligation working in maritime the loan would be written off, creating a financial incentive to keep shipping out. Another is to invest in advertising and recruitment, says the STAR Center's Pannell. Maritime employment isn't yet on the radar for every young student. Outreach and public awareness efforts could help change that. ""We reach out to high schools nationwide, and we work with the American School Counselors Association,"" Pannell states. ""The more counselors know about the maritime industry, the more they can steer the right candidates our way. You have to figure out innovative ways to get to those hands-on learners who may be interested."" Capt. Ted Morley, CEO of Florida-based Maritime Professional Training, adds that entry-level positions in shipping are a critical missing piece – an area that would benefit from federal backing. ""It's hard to gain experience when virtually every job requires experience,"" says Morley. ""Getting more companies on board with the idea of cadets or apprentices onboard is a big part of the puzzle. Policymakers could help by providing some means of support to these cadets or to the companies willing to place them.""

Denmark Thinks Russia-Linked Ships Launched Copenhagen Airport Drone Raid,https://maritime-executive.com/article/denmark-thinks-russia-linked-ships-launched-copenhagen-airport-drone-raid,,23/09/2025 18:15:43,,"The Danish authorities have identified three Russian-linked ships that potentially could have been used as launch platforms for drone overflights that closed down Copenhagen Airport on the night of September 22. Three large drones, which advertised their presence by switching lights on and off, overflew Copenhagen Airport, causing the airport to be shut down for nearly four hours. Oslo Airport in Norway was also closed for three hours at about the same time, after a single drone was spotted. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described the incident as being designed to cause chaos, and ‘the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date’. She also identified similarities in the attack to others carried out against European airports, in a week when Russia also deliberately violated Estonian airspace and sent at least 17 drones into Poland. The Prime Minister said that Russian involvement could not as yet be ruled out. The Danish Prime Minister’s comments were broadcast by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, the state broadcaster. The Danish Security & Intelligence Service PET and Copenhagen police described the overflights as ’professionally executed’ and as ostentatiously provocative. On the basis of previous involvement in suspicious activity, and suspected presence in the area, investigations are focused on three vessels which could have been used either launch platforms or as decoys, including Astrol 1 (IMO 9906544, top), a coastal freighter flagged in Russia; tanker Pushpa or Borocay (IMO 9332810), identified by Ukraine as a ""shadow fleet"" tanker with Russian ties; and Oslo Carrier 3 (IMO 9366146), reportedly a Russian-crewed freighter.

A fraudulent-flag designation automatically voids a vessel's insurance cover, if any. Though the vessels were not directly adjacent to the airport at the time of the security breach, and Pushpa did not pass through the Oresund at all, Astrol 1 showed unusual movements north of the area in the hours leading up to the incident. @pmolpmol lists three ships interesting as suspected drone carriers in last night attack on Copenhagen Airport.In this thread, I will argue that Russian ship ASTROL 1 is an excellent fit. Right time, right type, erratic track just before attack, highly suspicious background. pic.twitter.com/5rrYSMLtwI If the ships are seized or boarded, it may be difficult to find forensic evidence of any drone launch, as launch rails and control equipment can easily be disposed of. The Iranian use of small Delvar and Hengam Class logistic ships and converted cargo vessels as launch platforms for drones has demonstrated how easy it is to conduct launches - and it is not necessary to recover the drones at the end of the mission. It will also be feasible for any personnel directly involved to have been transferred promptly to another ship. The difficulties of proving involvement is an integral element of the attack plan devised by the as yet unidentified adversary, but given the seriousness of the provocation this may not be sufficient to prevent an attribution of blame. It is the second time in a month that European authorities have accused a ship of launching drones for covert purposes. On September 7, German police detained the Scanlark - a similar small cargo ship - at the southern Kiel-Holtenau lock of the Kiel Canal. “The reason for this was to avert threats to Germany's critical maritime infrastructure and an ongoing investigation by the Flensburg Public Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of spying for the purposes of sabotage and security-threatening imaging,” the police and prosecutors said in a joint statement at the time. “It is suspected that a drone was launched from the searched vessel on August 26, 2025, and controlled via a naval vessel in order to reconnoiter it and take photographs.”",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 04:37:14

The Sumud Flotilla is a convoy of fifty boats carrying dozens of pro-Palestinian activists from around the world. The group's mission is to deliver a symbolic cargo of baby formula, medicine and food to the beach in Gaza, breaching Israel's long-running naval blockade.

In a social media statement, flotilla spokeswoman and former UN official Francesca Albanese claimed that the boats had been attacked half a dozen times with ""sound bombs, explosive flares and sprayed with suspected chemicals"" overnight Tuesday. According to Albanese, the boats also experienced radio jamming.

"Fish ""Fingerprints"" in the Ocean Reveal Which Species Are Moving Habitats",https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/fish-fingerprints-in-the-ocean-reveal-which-species-are-moving-habitats,,24/09/2025 00:43:30,,"[By Chloe Hayes, Angus Mitchell, David Booth and Ivan Nagelkerken] pecies across the planet are on the move. Climate change has already caused more than 12,000 species to shift their homes across land, freshwater and the sea. They move to escape unfavorable conditions or to explore ecosystems that were previously inaccessible. In the ocean, some tropical fish are “packing their bags” and moving into temperate reefs to seek cooler waters. These migrations are already happening along the east coast of Australia, which is considered one of the fastest-warming marine regions on Earth. New coral and fish species are regularly arriving in Sydney’s oceans, and this is expected to increase with future climate change. These newcomers are traditionally monitored through visual surveys by researchers or citizen scientists. But many of these early arrivals are small, rare, nocturnal or live in caves, which means they can be easily missed. As a result, we may be underestimating the true rate of species on the move. That is where our new research, published in Diversity and Distributions, comes in. We took off our marine ecologist hats and became forensic scientists, searching the water for clues about species on the move. By analysing fragments of DNA drifting in the ocean, we set out to discover the hidden shifts in fish communities that traditional visual surveys can overlook. Genetic fingerprints floating in the ocean Every organism leaves behind traces of itself in the environment. Fish shed mucus, scales and waste – all of which contain DNA. By collecting and filtering samples of seawater, we can extract this environmental DNA – or eDNA, as it’s more commonly known – and identify the species that are there. The technique works much like forensic science. Just as detectives solve crimes by analysing fingerprints or hair left at a scene, ecologists can build a picture of marine life from the genetic fingerprints floating invisibly in the ocean. The idea of eDNA began in the 1980s when scientists discovered they could collect DNA directly from soil or water samples. At first it was used to study microbes. But by the early 2000s researchers realised it could also reveal larger animals and plants. Today, eDNA is being used everywhere – from soil to rivers and oceans – to discover hidden or threatened species, track biodiversity, and even study ancient ecosystems preserved in sediments. Surveying 2,000km of coastline To test how well eDNA can reveal species on the move, we surveyed fish communities along 2,000 kilometres of Australia’s east coast. Our sites ranged from the tropical reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, through to subtropical waters, and down to the temperate kelp forests of New South Wales. At each site, we conducted traditional visual surveys, swimming along defined rectangular areas known as transect belts and recording every fish we saw. These surveys remain the standard for monitoring marine biodiversity and have built decades of valuable data. Alongside these surveys, we collected bottles of seawater for DNA analysis. A few liters of water might not look like much, but it holds invisible genetic fingerprints of hundreds of species. Back in the lab, we filtered the samples to capture the DNA, then sequenced them to reveal a snapshot of which species were in the area. Detecting tropical species in temperate ecosystems When we compared traditional visual surveys with eDNA water samples, the results were interesting. Each method revealed a somewhat different fish community, but together they gave us a far more complete picture than either method could on its own. The eDNA detected tropical species in temperate ecosystems that had never been recorded there before. These included herbivores such as the lined surgeonfish (Acanthurus lineatus), the striated surgeonfish (Ctenochaetus striatus), and the common parrotfish (Scarus psittacus), and cryptic species such as the black-blotched porcupinefish (Diodon liturosus), the silver sweeper (Pempheris schwenkii), and the speckled squirrelfish (Sargocentron punctatissimum) that hide in caves or only emerge at night. These are exactly the kinds of fish divers are most likely to miss. The speckled squirrelfish (Sargocentron punctatissimum) is a cryptic tropical species that had never been recorded in temperate ecosystems before. kueda/iNaturalist, CC BY-NC-SA For temperate species, this pattern flipped. Divers were often better at detecting them than eDNA was. This showed us eDNA is not a replacement for traditional visual surveys, but a powerful complement. By combining the two, we can better track species on the move, giving us the clearest view yet of how climate change is reshaping our reefs. These migrations are not unique to Australia. Around the world, species are shifting their ranges as climate change alters temperatures, ocean currents and habitats. While some species may thrive in their new homes, others may struggle to adapt, or be pushed out. Tracking these shifts is crucial for understanding how climate change is transforming our oceans, and it means we need better ways to detect which species are on the move.

Israeli Airstrike on Hodeidah Damaged Last Remaining Piers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/israeli-airstrike-on-hodeidah-damaged-last-remaining-piers,,24/09/2025 00:40:31,,"The Israeli airstrike on the port of Hodeidah last week was intended to reduce the capacity of Yemen's Houthi rebel group, and a new damage assessment published Monday suggests that the attack had significant effects on all the surviving quays. According to a new review of satellite imaging by Critical Threats - a joint venture of the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War - the attack heavily damaged the handful of piers that were still in operation. Berths 4, 6 and 8 were the only remaining quays in active use early this month, and had been repaired to serviceability after earlier strikes; these piers were hit hard again in the September 16 attack. The damage at pier 8 includes an apparent hit on a Comoros-flagged freighter, the Bella A, as reported last week. The vessel appears to be leaking fuel oil into the water and may be partially sunken at its berth, based on satellite imaging from September 20.

ClassNK to Enhance the Safety and Loading Capacity of Container Ships,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/classnk-to-enhance-the-safety-and-loading-capacity-of-container-ships,,24/09/2025 11:05:28,,"[By: ClassNK] ClassNK has released new guidelines for those involved in container shipping, aiming to enhance the efficiency of container stowage while ensuring safety measures such as preventing cargo collapse. These guidelines apply the latest expertise in weather forecasting, ship motion, and digital twin technologies. The newly released 'Guidelines for the Safety of Maritime Cargo Based on Weather Forecasts,' 'Guidelines for Anti-Rolling Devices,' and 'Guidelines for Container Stowage and Securing Arrangements (Edition 3.3)' enable safer and higher-capacity container shipping by optimizing stowage based on weather forecasts for short-term voyages, and by taking advantage of the roll reduction effects of anti-rolling devices. The details of each guideline are as follows: 'Guidelines for the Safety of Maritime Cargo Based on Weather Forecasts' Route selection based on metocean information is one of the key factors in the safe transportation of cargo. Although weather forecasts are a valuable source of information when the forecast period is sufficiently short, it is necessary to take their uncertainties into account to ensure safety. However, there have been no specific standards until now, and each company has handled it individually. By clarifying the correlations between the AIS records accumulated by ClassNK, over one million cases of past metocean data, and actual sea conditions through big data analysis, this guideline specifies new technical requirements for uncertainty qualification of weather forecast values and safety assessments of cargo, and describes corresponding standard evaluation methods. In addition, this guideline also specifies a calculation method for a load correction factor based on weather forecasts for short-term voyages, related to container loading and lashing strength assessments for container carriers. By applying this guideline, safe and optimized stowage operations can be achieved in short-term voyages based on weather forecasts. 'Guidelines for Anti-Rolling Devices' Anti-rolling devices such as anti-rolling tanks have been increasingly installed on cargo ships in recent years for the purpose of improving safety, comfort, and work efficiency by reducing ship rolling. With growing concerns about cargo collapse accidents, attention to anti-rolling tanks has increased. While their installation on large merchant ships has started to spread, there have been no common safety standards so far. This guideline specifies technical and inspection requirements for anti-rolling devices installed on ships, making use of the expertise on ship motions gained during the development of the 'Guidelines for Parametric Roll Countermeasures,' and sets out a method for evaluating the effect of anti-rolling tanks on reducing roll motion. By applying this guideline, safe container stowage operations considering the roll reduction effects of anti-rolling devices can be realized. 'Guidelines for Container Stowage and Securing Arrangements' (Revised) The 'Guidelines for Container Stowage and Securing Arrangements (Edition 3.0),' released in 2023, has contributed to balancing safety and economic efficiency by enabling optimized stowage operations that take into account the effects of routes and seasons, in response to the enlargement of container ships and advances in lashing technology. With the release of the guidelines on weather forecasts and anti-rolling devices, the related requirements have now been revised to enable container stowage that also reflects these factors. The guidelines are available for download via ""Guidelines"" of My Page on ClassNK’s website after registration: https://www.classnk.or.jp/account/en/Rules_Guidance/ssl/guidelines.aspx ClassNK will continue to contribute to achieving safe and efficient shipping under various operating conditions through the guidelines and other initiatives.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 15:41:57
YSA Design Celebrates Four Decades Of Cruise Ship Excellence,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/ysa-design-celebrates-four-decades-of-cruise-ship-excellence,,24/09/2025 10:59:42,,"[By: YSA Design] YSA Design, whose ship interiors and exteriors design creativity has helped to define guest experiences in the modern cruise era, is celebrating its 40th anniversary. At a special gathering marking the occasion at its Oslo headquarters on 25th September, the company is bringing together past and present colleagues, customers, shipyards and other industry partners to celebrate its achievements over four decades of design excellence. YSA Design has been at the heart of multiple award-winning ships, with its work featuring across vessels built for Costa Cruises, Holland America Line, Hurtigruten, MSC Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, SeaDream, Viking Ocean Cruises, Virgin Voyages and more. It has worked with Disney Cruise Line since the group entered the sector in 1993. “We continue to innovate, by designing for custom-built vacations that serve luxury, wellness, individuality and adventure to match the creative vision of our clients’ brands,” says Anne Mari Gullikstad, CEO, YSA Design. “To attract the best next generation talent, we also invest in cutting edge design tools. Doing so enhances efficiency and transparency for customers and yards.” Formally established in 1985 by partners Petter Yran and Bjørn Storbraaten, the company restructured as YSA Design in 2016 after a management buy-in, with Gullikstad working alongside fellow board members Einar Jungård, Jan Krefting, Trond Sigurdsen and Tov Arne Svalestuen. Krefting, now Chair of YSA Design, joined in 1987 and has worked on high profile design projects through the cruise sector’s transformation into a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars. “We’ve seen it change from a business where we were the first people the owner called and the job was agreed on a handshake into an industry involving multiple stakeholders and a complex regulatory framework, where every minute is budgeted for,” he says. “We are always evolving but remain anchored in decades of industry experience, developing everything from the GA onwards to balance the best in aesthetic form with effective function.” With a 30-strong team made up of individuals from 13 nationalities, Gullikstad says multicultural dialogues are one driver for fresh thinking at YSA Design. “The team’s diversity offers a unique breeding ground for originality, and also provides the basis for the recommendations YSA Design makes on sustainable materials to protect our planet’s resources,” she says. Krefting adds: “Reaching our 40-year milestone is a fitting moment for YSA Design to celebrate, both its resilience in an industry that faced the challenges of 9/11 and COVID, and the creativity, knowledge, and open and honest collaboration that kept our cruise clients coming back for more.”",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 15:41:57

This collaboration underscores Steerprop’s commitment to developing propulsion solutions that meet the efficiency and sustainability challenges of tomorrow’s shipping industry.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 15:41:57
Indian Shipbuilder SDHI Moves Ahead With $480M Infrastructure Investment,https://maritime-executive.com/article/india-s-sdhi-moves-ahead-with-480m-infrastructure-investment,,24/09/2025 01:43:06,,"SDHI, the inheritor of the Pipavav Shipyard site, has secured an investment of about $480 million for infrastructure and training from the Gujarat Maritime Board. The funding will pay for improvements to the yard's jetties, cranes, fabrication facilities and dredged berths. The agreement will also underwrite construction of a ""center of excellence"" training institute to prepare 1,000 young apprentices per year on shipyard skills - a scale nearly unheard-of in the West. ""By investing in infrastructure, capacity, and skill development we will add world-class capabilities that accelerate India’s shipbuilding ecosystem. SDHI is laying the foundation for a new era of growth and cementing our nation’s place on the global maritime map for decades to come,"" said SDHI CEO Rear Admiral Vipin Kumar Saxena (retd.) last week. Separately, SDHI also announced an agreement with Royal IHC for the design, construction, and retrofitting of offshore oil and gas vessels. The deal solidifies SDHI's plans to explore a mix of commercial and defense contracting. “We are delighted to partner with Royal IHC at a time when the industry is witnessing a growing demand for offshore vessels capable of serving both oil & gas and renewable energy markets. This collaboration positions us to address these emerging opportunities with world-class capabilities and competitive solutions,"" SDHI director Vivek Merchant said in a statement. The SDHI yard has the largest dry dock in India, measuring 662 meters by 65 meters, along with a working space of about 500 acres. This is ideal for building aircraft carriers or VLCCs, or for high-volume work on smaller vessel classes. SDHI also has a cooperation agreement with state-run Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineering Ltd (GRSE), a leading defense yard in India. GRSE has enough orders that it anticipates building an expansion site within 3-5 years, and industry analysts suggest that the MoU could give it the ability to access SDHI's extra capacity as well. The international partnership with Royal IHC is the latest in a growing number of deals between Indian shipyards and foreign firms. In July, HD Hyundai announced a partnership agreement with state-owned Cochin Shipyard to share design work, technology and equipment supply chains. The agreement also covers workforce training and marketing, combining HD Hyundai's brand recognition and sales relationships with Cochin's capacity for expansion.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 15:41:57
South Korea Offers Financial Support for Building Ice-Class Vessels,https://maritime-executive.com/article/south-korea-offers-financial-support-for-building-ice-class-vessels,,24/09/2025 00:12:10,,"South Korea plans to inject significant government support into its Arctic shipping plans, including a subsidy for icebreaking vessels. Earlier this month, oceans minister Chun Jae-Soo revealed that the government will offer financial support to accelerate building of ice-class ships. This followed a recent announcement that Korea would start pilot operations in Arctic shipping next year. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung campaigned on the agenda of leveraging Arctic shipping to revive the country’s southern ports. To fund these plans, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) has been allocated $5.2 billion for the 2026 financial year, representing 8.4% increase from the current budget of $4.8 billion. The bigger budget will help facilitate expansion of the Arctic shipping routes, with support earmarked to prepare ports and construction of ice-class vessels. “We will invest $8 million per vessel built with icebreaking capabilities for operation on the Arctic shipping routes,” said Minister Chun. He added that the icebreakers are likely to start operations in the Arctic from 2030, citing a study from the Korean Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH). South Korean shipbuilders have experience in constructing ice-class vessels. The shipyards including Hanwha Ocean and Samsung Heavy Industries have in the past delivered icebreakers for Russian projects. The yards are now shifting focus to build for South Korean clients. In July, Hanwha Ocean announced that it will be building a $200 million icebreaking research vessel for the Korean Polar Research Institute, scheduled for delivery in 2029. Additionally, MOF has allocated $1.1 billion to position southern ports for Arctic shipping. Most of the fleet serving the Arctic route passes near the Korean Peninsula. For this reason, South Korea is upgrading its ports including Busan, Yeosu and Gwangyang to handle Arctic shipping. With the reported growth of shipping along the Northern Sea Route, South Korea wants to leverage on this surge to retain its southern region as a global maritime hub. Chun confirmed that the MOF will be relocating to Busan as a show of commitment to revitalize the maritime sector in the southern region. The ministry is currently based in Sejong city, together with other central government agencies.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 15:41:57

Ukraine Strikes Russians in Black Sea Novorossiysk Port,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-strikes-russians-in-black-sea-novorossiysk-port,,24/09/2025 16:01:25,,"Russian officials along the Black Sea coast declared states of emergencies and warned citizens to seek shelter as Ukraine launched a large attack aimed at the Novorossiysk seaport. There are conflicting reports on the number of casualties, but the widespread attack caused authorities in Gelendzhik, about 25 miles to the south, to order ships to cease navigation as they warned the waters were unsafe. Tourists as far away as Sochi (75 miles) were told to leave the water and the beach for shelter. The reports indicate a combination of sea and aerial drones started hitting the city in the early hours of Wednesday, September 24. There were no confirmations other than a statement from the Russian Defense Ministry, which said it had downed 16 drones over the Black Sea. It was later revised to say air defense forces had intercepted and destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones over seven Russian regions and the Black Sea. Officials were reminding residents that it is prohibited to film and post photos/videos of the attacks. However, videos began emerging online, including one showing a sea drone exploding near the city center of Novorossiysk in Tsemess Bay. Another showed shots being fired at another sea drone. The mayor of Novorossiysk issued an alert on social media regarding a threat of unmanned boats. He later revised it, talking of drones that struck the city while warning residents to stay away from windows and rooms facing the sea. They were told to take shelter in basements or underground garages, as he said the city was in a state of emergency. Mayor Andrey Kravchenko initially reported two people were killed and three were injured. Other government agencies were saying that casualties had risen to seven, with six taken to hospitals. After the first wave of the attack, the Operational Headquarters later warned on social media that alarms were again sounding for another potential drone attack. It is unclear what the targets were, with some reports speculating the focus was on the Black Sea fleet. Ukraine is also targeting Russia’s energy infrastructure, and today, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) reported its offices were damaged, with two individuals injured. The mayor later contended that some of the drones had struck a hotel and other places in the center of the city. CPC and Sheskharis, Bloomberg reports, both suspended oil operations as a precaution. Combined the two terminals handle more than 2 million barrels of oil a day according to Bloomberg. Earlier this month, Ukraine also struck Russia’s Primorsk seaport on the Baltic. Reports indicated that parts of the oil terminal were damaged. Ukraine appears to be targeting to interrupt the energy trade, but days later, reports said some operations had been restored at Primorsk.",Maritime Executive,24/09/2025 21:27:08

EPS to Consolidate LNG Transport by Buying Remaining Shares of CoolCo,https://maritime-executive.com/article/eps-to-consolidate-lng-transport-by-buying-remaining-shares-of-coolco,,24/09/2025 22:39:41,,"CoolCo, a pure play LNG Carrier, which has been publicly traded for just over three years, is in advanced discussions with its majority owner, Eastern Pacific Shipping, for a potential buyout of its outstanding shares. The move comes in response to the outlook for LNG shipping after CoolCo grew rapidly after being spun off from Golar LNG in 2022. EPS worked with Golar in the formation of the dedicated LNG shipping company to simplify the corporate structure and create a pure play well-positioned to participate in the rapidly growing LNG market. Three years later, analysts expect an emerging oversupply of LNG as the United States and others have moved rapidly to increase production and exports. There has also been a rush to build vessels for the sector, and now the U.S. is looming over the business with a proposed requirement that a portion of LNG exports must be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels. “Despite challenging market conditions, our commitment to CoolCo’s long-term development and, above all, to serving our charterers with the highest level of reliability and dedication remains unchanged. We believe our offer provides the best long-term alternative for CoolCo shareholders, and we hope to bring this proposed transaction to a close in the very near future,” said Cyril Ducau, CEO of Eastern Pacific Shipping. The terms being discussed call for a cash offer of $9.65 per share for the 41 percent of the stock that EPS does not currently own. It represents a 26 percent premium to the closing price on September 22, 2025, and a 38 percent premium to the 90-day trading average. The Board of Directors of CoolCo has established an independent Special Committee, comprised solely of independent and disinterested directors, to review and negotiate the terms of the potential transaction. CoolCo traces its origins to the founding of Gotaas-Larsen in 1946 and the company’s first LNG carrier ordered in 1970. Gotaas-Larsen became Golar in 2001 and later entered the FLNG sector as a developer of floating terminals, and today is the only independent provider of FLNG as a service. They separated the business in 2022 as part of a long-term plan that the companies had been pursuing for several years. The LNG standalone company named CoolCo emerged, owning eight vessels, and acquired the ship management business from Golar. Today, the fleet consists of 13 LNG carriers owned by CoolCo as well as three additional managed vessels. It took delivery on two newbuilds in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, while highlighting that its strategy includes ongoing assessment of growth opportunities through vessel acquisitions and potential consolidation in the fragmented LNG market. It draws on its relationship with EPS to strengthen its position with shipyards, financial institutions, and deal flow access.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51
Typhoon Ragasa Disrupts Shipping Across Southern China,https://maritime-executive.com/article/typhoon-ragasa-disrupts-shipping-across-southern-china,,24/09/2025 22:18:44,,"A super typhoon has disrupted shipping in southern China and Taiwan over the last few days, forcing port closures and diversions. No marine casualties have yet been reported, but on shore the toll is significant, including 14 dead in a levee failure in Taiwan. Super Typhoon Ragasa formed in the Western Pacific last week and headed northwest for Taiwan on a gradual, erratic path. Strengthening into the equivalent to a category 5 hurricane, it packed peak wind speeds of more than 100 knots, making it the world's most powerful storm of 2025. It passed south of Taiwan, sparing the island of the worst risks. However, in eastern Hualien county, torrential rain from the storm caused a naturally-occurring barrier lake to burst its banks, sending mud and water rushing downstream. 14 people were killed in the resulting flood (revised downward from initial reports of 17 deaths). In coastal Guangzhou, southern China's economic powerhouse, the typhoon forced sweeping shutdowns at ports, airports, and public places. Forecasts predicted powerful winds, up to 17 inches of rain and coastal wave heights of up to 23 feet. Residents were advised to shelter in place and avoid going outside until after the storm passed, and social media postings showed sold-out supermarket shelves in major commercial hubs like Shenzhen. On Ragasa's arrival in Hong Kong and Macau, the storm caused considerable property damage. This happened at the Fullerton Hotel Ocean Park in Hong Kong a couple hours ago. I have never seen anything like this before. I was up at 4 am taping my windows because water was just pouring in... Ragasa is indeed a super Typhoon ... pic.twitter.com/O59FJbGLsE The region's thriving container-freight hubs in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou closed on Monday as the storm approached, and terminal operators secured their facilities to reduce the risk of damage. The shutdown happened just ahead of China's ""Golden Week"" holiday, the annual factory closure that typically prompts a flurry of shipping activity in the weeks prior. Affected terminals included SCT, CCT, MCT Terminals and Yantian International Container Terminals (YICT). From Monday on, only outbound transits were permitted for container ships, and small vessels at berth were ordered to be secured in port. It is the second time in a month that a storm has disrupted southern China's terminals, following Typhoon No. 16 in early September - and it may not be the last. Storm Opong is right behind, and is on track to strengthen into a typhoon by Thursday. Opong's trackline should take it across southern Luzon and out into the South China Sea over the next several days, then onwards towards Hainan.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51
NYK Demonstrates First Liquefied Ammonia STS Contributing to Supply Chain,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nyk-demonstrates-first-liquefied-ammonia-sts-contributing-to-supply-chain,,24/09/2025 21:43:16,,"NYK reports it recently completed its first ship-to-ship transfer involving liquified ammonia. Building the expertise and transfer capabilities for the highly toxic material is seen as a critical element in building the structure to support the growth of ammonia transport and its use as a marine fuel. With demand expected to increase, NYK says that the STS method, which is not constrained by port size or onshore equipment, is attracting attention as a flexible supply method compared to conventional land-based cargo handling methods. Currently, the regulatory environment is still being developed for ammonia, while several initiatives are working to establish the safety protocols for the handling of ammonia. Beyond its existing applications in fertilizers and chemicals, ammonia, NYK notes, is emerging as a next-generation clean energy source. It is being developed as a carbon-free combustion alternative as well as an efficient energy carrier. Ammonia cracking is seen as a key means of transporting hydrogen. Ammonia is expected to be used in various applications, including marine fuel. “The success of this operation marks a significant milestone in developing an international supply network for ammonia,” reports NYK. “With the support of Trammo's longstanding experience and their designated STS specialist provider, International Fender Providers, we successfully leveraged our advanced safety management system and refined STS operational know-how to safely transfer the entire cargo of liquefied ammonia.” The transfer operation took place on September 2 off the coast of Ceuta, Spain. It involved the ammonia carrier Berlian Ekuator (26,776 dwt) owned by NYK and time-chartered by Mitsui & Co. Built in 2004, the vessel is registered in Panama. The liquified ammonia was transferred to the ammonia carrier Eco Enchanted (30,062 dwt), a Greek-owned vessel operated by Trammo, a leading ammonia trader. Approximately 23,000 MT of ammonia were transferred between the two vessels. It was conducted with an STS hose connection. NYK reports it will build on the insights and experience gained from this STS operation to further advance next-generation fuels and strengthen safe maritime transportation systems. It is part of its efforts to grow this sector of shipping and to contribute to the broader goal of achieving a decarbonized society.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51
"UN Trade Body Warns Shipping is in a Period of Fragile Growth, Rising Costs",https://maritime-executive.com/article/un-trade-body-warns-shipping-is-in-a-period-of-fragile-growth-rising-costs,,24/09/2025 21:12:44,,"After years of strong growth in global seaborne trade volumes, a new report from the United Nations’ trade and development organization UNCTAD warns that global maritime trade is entering a period of fragile growth, rising costs, and mounting uncertainty. The report is calling for more action to stabilize trade policies, investments in sustainability and digitalization, cautioning that rising freight costs most endanger smaller and less developed countries, which are net importers of food and other essential materials. According to the data from UNCTAD, global seaborne trade volumes grew a modest 2.2 percent in 2024. They warn, however, that it is expected to slow to just 0.5 percent in 2025. Vessel rerouting, for example, they warn drove ton-miles to a record 6 percent in 2024, which was nearly three times faster than trade volume growth. They further warn that geopolitical tensions, new trade barriers, and climate pressures that are reshaping shipping routes are pushing up costs and exposing vulnerabilities in the global economy. They write that these pressures are mounting as the slowdown in global seaborne trade emerges. “Small island developing states, least developed countries, and net food importing nations are the most vulnerable, because higher freight costs quickly translate into more expensive imports and food insecurity,” reported Regina Asariotis, Chief of UNCTAD’s Trade Logistics Branch. The reroutings have also contributed to increases in congestion and longer waiting times at global ports. UNCTAD highlights the urgent need to invest in digital systems while finding that many developing countries continue to lag behind in digitalization. It also highlights the uncertainties over net-zero strategies, saying that clear regulatory signals are vital to spurring fleet renewals and new fuel infrastructure to reduce emissions. It notes that the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions rose five percent in 2024, with only eight percent of the world’s fleet tonnage currently equipped to use alternative fuels. “Persistent high transport costs risk hitting developing countries the hardest,” said Grynspan. “Maritime transport must be resilient, inclusive, and sustainable if we are to weather the turbulent waters ahead.” UNCTAD believes that, in addition to stable trade policies to reduce uncertainties and restore confidence in supply chains, support for vulnerable economies will be required to help mitigate higher costs likely to come as shipping transitions to meet the current environmental challenges. They believe investment is required for shipping and port infrastructure, as well as digitalization and cybersecurity. The 2025 report calls for accelerating these focuses, saying that they will reduce some of the pressures, but UNCTAD warns of “stormy seas” ahead as trade slows and costs rise.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51
France Awards its Largest Offshore Wind Project to TotalEnergies Consortium,https://maritime-executive.com/article/france-awards-its-largest-offshore-wind-project-to-totalenergies-consortium,,24/09/2025 20:16:50,,"France’s Ministry of Industry and Energy announced the selection of a consortium headed by TotalEnergies for the development and operation of the country’s largest offshore wind farm to date. The massive project, which would be TotalEnergies’ first large project in the country, represents a 50 percent increase in the company’s investment in the French energy sector. The consortium, which consisted of TotalEnergies and RWE, was one of seven qualified to bid for the Centre Manche 2 project, which will be located approximately 25 miles off the Normandy coast. It calls for 1.5 GW of capacity, more than doubling the renewable energy that would be available in the region. The companies bid the energy price for the project at €66/MWh. “We are very proud to have won this tender for the construction of the largest renewable energy park in France to date. It embodies Total’s transformation into TotalEnergies in France,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies. The company noted that the project represents a total investment of approximately $5.3 billion, with its current total investment in French renewables at approximately $9.4 billion since 2020. TotalEnergies highlights that it has a total portfolio of 25 GW of wind energy capacity operating or in development. This includes projects in the United Kingdom, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, and France. As part of their proposal, the companies committed to a number of unique elements. They say they will include a portion of crowdfunding financing so that local residents and authorities in the Normandy region can invest in the project. They also committed to becoming a leader in designing the wind farm for recycling. They propose that 95 percent of the blades, towers, and nacelles, and 100 percent of generator magnets, will be recycled, reused, or repurposed. The project, however, is already facing challenges. Partner RWE announced that after a strategic review of its investments, it wishes to exit the consortium. To do that, it will require approval from the French authorities. TotalEnergies says it will still pursue the project, assuming all the commitments. However, it will also propose to bring a new partner into the project. The auction had been in planning for three years since 2022, but it became the last for the outgoing government. It had offered the Normandy site as well as a second site located in the South Atlantic off the island of Oleron. Nine companies had qualified, but that site has challenges, including water depth, seabed, and wind conditions, and in the end, no bids were received for the project. That is despite the terms that made it possible to bid the energy price up to €100/MWh. The government highlights that it awarded three floating wind projects in South Brittany and the Mediterranean in 2024 and has new projects in commissioning for 2025. However, France still lags with just 1.5 GW of installed capacity, although the government highlights a cumulative 7.8 GW under construction or under development. Its goal is for 45 GW in service by 2050. TotalEnergies reports it will proceed with the planning and studies for Centre Manche 2, anticipating a final investment decision by early 2029. Electricity production is expected to begin in 2033.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51

Ukraine Condemns China’s Operating a Containership from Crimea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-condemns-china-s-operating-a-containership-from-crimea,,24/09/2025 19:08:40,,"Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is lashing out at China and calling for immediate action a day after The Financial Times revealed that a Chinese-owned containership has established service into Russian-occupied Crimea. Ukraine says it has filed an official protest with China’s foreign ministry and notified the International Maritime Organization of what it termed a conscious and brazen disregard for the sovereignty of Ukraine. The West enacted sanctions in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, including barring shipping from using the ports in Crimea. According to the report in the Financial Times, international shipping has avoided the port. Ukraine has recently seized and sold small cargo ships that it accused of exporting grains and other materials from Crimea. Using data supplied by Ukraine, the FT and others tracked the movements of the containership Heng Yang 9, and the FT reports it has made at least three trips to Crimea in recent months. Built in 2012, the 10,500 dwt containership changed owners in 2024, and its registry was transferred from China to Panama. Equisis lists the owners as Guangxi Changhai Shipping, which has also managed the ship since 2012. In September, Heng Yang 9 falsified its tracks in the Black Sea, reporting false positions via transponder. Satellite images from Sept 6-15 show no ship at reported locations in Novorossiysk or Port Kavkaz. Aerial photos from Sevastopol (Sept 14) match images of Heng Yang 9... pic.twitter.com/HHGxWlXy6u Tracking data suggests the ship has repeatedly altered its transmissions, reporting it was at Port Kavkaz on the eastern side of the Kerch Strait. Analyzing satellite data, the ship appears to have traveled from Istanbul, made a stop in Novorossiysk, and then, while disguising its AIS signal, has gone into Sevastopol. FT also reports that the containers on the deck when the vessel arrived in Istanbul on September 17 were in the same configuration as the vessel spotted in Sevastopol days earlier. FT believes the vessel is being used for exports coming from the industrial and agricultural regions of Donetsk and Kherson, also in occupied Ukraine. They cite Russian reports of a new railway into Crimea that was designed to handle containers from Russia. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Heorhiy Tykhy said in a statement that the vessel was deliberately concealing its movements and transmitting false data. They are calling for China to take urgent measures to prevent these violations, although China does not recognize the Western sanctions. China, in the past, has said, however, that companies are advised to avoid contact with occupied Crimea.

Iranian Armed Forces Deploy Bluff and Empty Rhetoric,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-armed-forces-deploy-bluff-and-empty-rhetoric,,24/09/2025 19:01:40,,"During the 12-Day War, the regular Iranian Armed Forces (Artesh) were not the principal target. The Artesh suffered limited damage, primarily to its air defense and air assets. But the impact of the war appears however to have had a much deeper impact on operational effectiveness, by undermining confidence and morale. This is evidenced by the lack of operational and training activity since June, and by the high level of empty and fanciful rhetoric describing Iranian ‘victories’ during the conflict. Once the Iranian Navy (Nedaja) returned to its principal homeport in Bandar Abbas at the end of August, key capabilities which the Nedaja would need to deploy in order to carry out its blue water mission have remained tied up. The Nedaja’s five operational Alvand and Moudge Class frigates and the intelligence collection frigate IRINS Zagros (H313) have been alongside since the beginning of September. Throughout this period, the US Navy’s carrier strike group led by USS Nimitz (CVN-68) has cruised undisturbed along the Iranian coastline and taken a break in Jebel Ali for a port visit to Dubai. Another key Nedaja force component, needed to support any extended operations, are the converted logistic vessels IRINS Makran (K441) and the Nedaja’s latest arrival IRINS Kurdestan (K442). Both ships, moored alongside each other in the outer harbor at Bandar Abbas, have not moved from their pier for weeks. The Nedaja’s commander, Rear Admiral Shahram Irani, a professional naval officer rather than a political appointee, has unusually made no announcements about operational deployments, nor has greeted any ships on their return to port from deployments, as he is wont to do. For long-term observers of Artesh activity, the slump in operational and training activity is marked, although some Western press reports continue to reproduce Iranian statements without considering their veracity. Such false reports include claims that the Artesh air force shot down five Israeli F-35s during the war, and that Iranian F-14 pilots had engaged in prolonged dogfights with Israeli aircraft. A report also likely to be untrue is the suggestion that Iran had taken delivery of MiG-29 aircraft from Russia, as a stopgap while awaiting delivery of Su-35 4th generation fighters. With an ability to fire long-range anti-ship missiles, this could represent an additional threat to shipping off Iran. The reality is however that Iran has for some time possessed a small number of MiG-29 aircraft, deployed at Tehran (TAB-1) and Isfahan (TAB-8) airbases. So the only source of the report, Iranian hardliner politician Abolfazl Zohrevand, was likely inventing a story to cover for the fact that Iran has still not received delivery of Su-35 aircraft from Russia, which were paid for in 2022. These aircraft were built several years ago, and until recently had mostly been parked up outside the factory at Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Siberia, probably lacking electrical control systems. However, the Su-35s taken off the parking lot are still unlikely to be heading for Iran whilst Russia suffers shortages of operational aircraft in its war against Ukraine. There have been no confirmatory Russian reports of any Su-35 deliveries to Iran. 24 Su-35 for Iran in May 2023 (L), 15 Su-35 visible at Komsomolsk in August 2025 (R) (Google Earth/Airbus) The true state of the Artesh needs to be taken into account when Iran issues threats such as to close the Straits of Hormuz, at a time when Iran is under pressure to resume negotiations over nuclear weapons development. If talks are not resumed, then snap-back sanctions are likely to be imposed on Iran from September 27, resulting in a further rise in political tensions and threats from which the Artesh may wish to excuse themselves.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51

Vessels in the Sumud Flotilla appear unable to rid themselves of the endless repeats of the song without switching off their radios and losing communications with each other.

Fire Casualty Stena Immaculate to Depart UK Port,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fire-casualty-stena-immaculate-to-depart-uk-port,,24/09/2025 17:04:07,,"After spending approximately five months docked in Great Yarmouth, the US-flagged tanker Stena Immaculate is leaving the port, although her fate remains uncertain. The vessel was hit by the Portuguese-registered containership Solong in March while it was anchored off the UK coast, transporting over 220,000 barrels of jet fuel for the U.S. The 49,729 dwt tanker burned for days along with the containership off the coast, with one seafarer from the containership missing and presumed to have died in the collision. One of the tanker's tanks ruptured and spilled oil, but operator Crowley and Stena Bulk hailed the crew, which quickly responded and started the fire suppression systems before abandoning ship. The companies later hired another tanker and were able to transfer most of the fuel from the Stena Immaculate. The ship was brought to the outer Great Yarmouth harbor, where further salvage operations were undertaken after the ship was surveyed. According to port records seen by the Great Yarmouth Mercury newspaper, the ship had been expected to be towed from the dock on Wednesday, September 24. The operation is currently delayed, with the port saying they expect the tanker will depart on Friday, September 26. The port logs show it is first to be towed approximately 10 miles north to a point near Winterton-on-Sea. The Solong had initially been towed to Aberdeen in Scotland, where it was cleaned and cleared of debris. It was sold and towed to Belgium for recycling in August. The incident remains under investigation, while the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Bureau issued a preliminary update in April highlighting the lack of a lookout aboard the containership despite patchy fog in the area. The master was alone on the bridge, navigating the vessel, which was traveling at approximately 16 knots, when it hit the Stena tanker. The UK authority said that as part of its investigation, it would be reviewing the anchorage and policies for the area. The master of Solong was arrested and has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter for the death of the crewmember on his ship. The master has pleaded not guilty but remains in custody in the UK. He was last in court on September 10, where his custody was extended. There are further hearings expected in November, followed by his trial in January 2026. Crowley announced in August that the Stena Immaculate had been replaced by the charter of the CS Anthem for the U.S. Tanker Security Program.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 04:37:51

Sea Legend's New China-Europe Arctic Shipping Service Draws Scrutiny,https://maritime-executive.com/article/sea-legend-s-new-china-europe-arctic-shipping-service-draws-scrutiny,,25/09/2025 03:19:52,,"Chinese shipping startup Sea Legend is attracting attention with a new route to Europe via the Northern Sea Route, the Arctic shipping lane passing north of Siberia. The new NSR service, dubbed ""China-Europe Arctic Express,"" consists of a 25-year-old Panamax boxship dubbed Istanbul Bridge. The vessel departed Ningbo on September 22 and is due to reach Britain on October 10, 18 days later. After calling at Felixstowe, the vessel will proceed to Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. The launch of the express service is aimed at just-in-time delivery for the Christmas season in Europe. A comparable voyage on the Suez route (assuming safe passage through the Red Sea) would take more than twice as long. This means less fuel burned and less carbon emitted for the same voyage, with lower cost than transcontinental rail service. It also has geopolitical advantages: for China, it is a long-sought new route to EU markets, and a symbolic victory for ""Polar Silk Road"" ambitions; and for Russia, it delivers on President Vladimir Putin's oft-repeated wish for higher traffic on the NSR. Shipping services on the NSR are seasonal, limited to a matter of months in late summer. Ice clogs the eastern stretches of the route for most of the year. Russian icebreaker escorts can extend the season at the margins, but heavy ice precludes navigation in the depths of winter - for now, at least. Istanbul Bridge is not an ice-class vessel; many of the Russian cargo ships that operate on the route are built to Russian Register ice class specifications. The ship started life in 2000 under Italian ownership, and it has changed hands and names many times. It has a history of minor inspection deficiencies in the last five years, but no detentions. Three-year-old startup Sea Legend is no stranger to adventurous routing. It made its name in 2023-4 by running a regular service through the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, managing the risk of Houthi attacks with the assistance of a Chinese PLA Navy escort. Sea Legend has not disclosed its fuel selection for the new route. Though the CO2 advantages of the shorter route are considerable, environmental advocates with the Clean Arctic Alliance are skeptical that the new service offers an improvement. The IMO Arctic Treaty's heavy fuel oil ban does not take effect until 2029, and the alliance has asked for clarification on whether Sea Legend is carrying HFO or distillate, which would burn more cleanly in operation and dissipate more quickly in the event of a spill. “With the Arctic already under severe stress, warming faster than the global average and acidifying faster than the global average due to global climate change, sending container ships across the Arctic sets off alarm bells,"" said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance. ""CO2 reductions will be meaningless if shipping in the Arctic results in higher emissions of super-pollutant black carbon, which has a 1600 times greater climate impact than CO2 on a 20 year basis and a disproportionate impact when emitted near to snow and ice.""",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 09:31:35
"On World Maritime Day, IMO Emphasizes Protecting the Ocean",https://maritime-executive.com/article/on-world-maritime-day-imo-emphasizes-protecting-the-ocean,,25/09/2025 01:38:54,,"On Thursday, the IMO will lead the celebration of World Maritime Day, and its emphasis this year is on environmental protection - one of the global body's core roles. The IMO's selected theme for 2025 is ""Our Ocean, Our Obligation, Our Opportunity."" In picking this theme, IMO aims to reflect the ocean's triple role as a habitat for other species, a heat reservoir to offset warming, and a transport medium for human commerce. More than 80 percent of all trade moves by sea, so the ocean's navigable waters play a key role in the global economy. As an industry, shipping has environmental effects, and IMO's regulations help to manage and mitigate them. The UN body emphasized that it now has a ""growing portfolio of technical assistance initiatives"" to help all of its 176 member states to implement those regulations - a major undertaking, as enforcement is uneven and depends wholly upon each nation's jurisdiction. IMO also wants to highlight other UN efforts to protect the ocean, beyond the realm of the shipping industry. The newly-concluded UN agreement on protecting biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (the High Seas Treaty) is a landmark for defending wild habitat in the global commons, and the UN is still working on a possible treaty on capping plastic production, a root cause of ocean plastic pollution. IMO also emphasizes the opportunity to create a shipping industry where more people will want to work, including women, who frequently report certain challenges in seagoing roles. The UN agency isn't alone in trying to make shipping a career of choice for more people. ""True sustainability also means caring for people. Seafarers are at the helm of this industry, and their wellbeing and safety must always come first. That’s why AMSA is unwavering in our commitment to uphold the Maritime Labour Convention and the Port State Control regime,"" said Australian Maritime Safety Authority CEO Kaylene Dale in a statement. The next theme is already set for 2026 - and for 2027. In recognition of the role that member states have to play in making international standards meaningful, IMO has decided to focus on practical implementation of the rules for the next two years. The theme for 2026-7 will be ""From Policy to Practice: Powering Maritime Excellence"" - focusing on member states' ability put existing treaties into practice on the water, not just on the books. ""The theme transmits a clear message of our commitment to ensuring regulations are put into action and providing the necessary technical assistance for implementation to Member States,"" said IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez, who requested the two-year emphasis. ""This ultimately strengthens the confidence that global rules agreed at IMO can lead to safer, more secure and environmentally sound shipping worldwide.""",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 09:31:35

Germany's Navy Also Wants to Buy an Unmanned Arsenal Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/germany-s-navy-also-wants-to-buy-an-unmanned-arsenal-ship,,25/09/2025 01:37:42,,"The German Navy is joining the rush towards manned-unmanned teaming in surface warfare. Like the U.S. Navy's still-unfolding plans for modular unmanned payload carriers that would accompany the fleet, Germany's armed forces have a long-term plan to buy unmanned arsenal ships of their own, which would augment the firepower of traditional surface combatants. The German version is tailored for one primary purpose: carrying more missiles. The future Large Remote Missile Vessels (LRMVs) would work alongside the German Navy's next-generation F127 frigate, the replacement for the F124 Sachsen-class. At an expected 10,000 tonnes, the F127 will be ample for a frigate, and is modeled on the capabilities of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer - but with fewer VLS cells for full-size missiles. The extra capacity of an unmanned arsenal ship like LRMV would help offset the smaller magazine of the F127, and would split the typical payload of one warship between two different platforms, complicating targeting for the enemy. Germany plans to buy six F127 frigates, augmented with three unmanned LRMVs. The War Zone noted the strong similarities between the German plan and the Netherlands' Damen-designed Multifunctional Support Ship (MSS), a lightly-manned modular vessel that can be fitted with deck-mounted missile launchers. MSS was announced in 2022 and awarded to Damen in 2024, and is based on an off-the-shelf offshore vessel design to ensure reduced risk and fast delivery. The U.S. Navy and the Defense Department have experimented with very similar concepts, notably a trial-scale program featuring optionally-manned crewboats with modular missile launchers and other equipment bolted onto the aft cargo deck (the ""Ghost Fleet Overlord"" program). Those trials have been successful enough - and the need for fleet expansion is great enough - that the U.S. Navy is soliciting designs for a large-scale unmanned fleet, dubbed the Modular Surface Attack Craft (MASC) program. MASC encompasses three different unmanned-vessel sizes, the largest capable of carrying up to four forty-foot payloads - enough space for 16 containerized VLS cells for SM-series missiles. The service is moving fast to advance its unmanned programs and take advantage of a substantial funding pot in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which set aside $1.5 billion for small USVs and $2.1 billion for medium USVs (on top of the Navy's FY2026 defense bill appropriation). Under Navy Secretary John Phelan, the administration of unmanned procurement is undergoing an overhaul: following a review, unmanned surface vessels will be developed, bought and maintained by a new Program Executive Office for Robotic and Autonomous systems (RAS), not the existing office for small combatants.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 15:43:07

Indian Court Lowers Bond for Release of Arrested MSC Containership,https://maritime-executive.com/article/indian-court-lowers-bond-for-release-of-arrested-msc-containership,,25/09/2025 17:20:50,,"An MSC containership, which has been detained in India since early July, has won a reduction in the required court bond so that the vessel may be able to soon depart. The vessel is caught up in the broader claims for damages filed by the state of Kerala after the loss of the MSC Elsa 3 in May off the coast. The MSC Akiteta II was arrested on July 9 during its normal port call as collateral in the compensation claims case filed for the damages incurred from the loss of the containership, which sank approximately 14 nautical miles off the coast. The company has contended there was only a small release of oil, but as many as 100 containers were floating or washed ashore, as well as large quantities of plastic beads (nurdles) and other debris. An initial effort using divers was able to cap the fuel leaks, and last month, a saturation diving effort began to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel, which is lying on the seabed approximately 167 feet (51 meters) below the surface. The ship went down with over 85 metric tons of diesel and 367 metric tons of fuel oil aboard. Environmental groups, according to the Indian media, are claiming there is serious ecological damage in the south-eastern Arabian Sea. They assert that water quality and marine life have been disrupted and that hydrocarbon and heavy-metal pollution have been traced to the wreck. The state filed a total of over $1 billion in claims against MSC Mediterranean Shipping and the ship manager. This includes damages to the environment, the costs of steps taken to reduce the damage and clean the pollution, and toward the economic loss of the fishing community. As part of the claim, the Kerala High Court arrested the MSC Akiteta II and ordered the company to post a bond for the release of the ship. Lawyers for MSC declined to post the bond and have been arguing to limit MSC’s liability to possibly just $14.8 million. They contend the wreck is outside the state’s jurisdiction and called the amount sought “unrealistic.” They have also moved to consolidate the claims filed with the court. The Kerala High Court on Thursday, September 25, lowered the bond for the MSC Akiteta II to approximately $140 million. The court, however, has reserved the right for the state to file additional documentation on its claims to increase the bond or to arrest other MSC vessels in the future. Several MSC containerships have been detained related to various claims related to the MSC Elsa 3, including those from the fishing community and shippers who had cargo lost aboard the vessel. Those cases, however, resulted in smaller bonds, and the other vessels were released after only a short period of time. MSC Akiteta II, built in 2002, is registered in Liberia. It has a capacity of 2,226 TEU and was operating its route when it was detained at the Vizhinjam Port. The vessel has remained for 11 weeks in the anchorage.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 21:30:22
UK’s Royal Navy Highlights Increased Monitoring of Russian Vessels,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-s-royal-navy-highlights-increased-monitoring-of-russian-vessels,,25/09/2025 15:59:33,,"The UK’s Royal Navy reports that it has seen an increase in the number of Russian vessels transiting the English Channel, and it is responding by maintaining its patrol efforts. They report the operation is part of the ongoing commitment to safeguard UK waters and protect national security. The monitoring is being stepped up after numerous reports of drones possibly being launched from Russian-controlled vessels. Air traffic was suspended on Monday at Copenhagen's airport after drones which the Danish authorities said they suspected were launched from a nearby cargo ship. Germany has reported similar instances of drones in recent months also suspecting they were being launched from ships. The latest monitoring effort began on September 20 when a well-known Russian cargo ship used for military cargoes, Sparta IV (8,870 dwt), was identified as moving west through the North Sea. The cargo ship was being escorted by the Soviet-era frigate RFN Neustrashimy (3,500 tons displacement), which was commissioned in 1993. Sparta IV has been sailing for the Russians since 2018 and is operated by a sanctioned shipping company. The Royal Navy once again called on its Plymouth-based frigate HMS Iron Duke (4,900 tons displacement) for the monitoring operation. It was the 18th time in the past 12 months that the warship has been activated for monitoring missions. They report a total of 25 Russian vessels have been monitored, giving the Iron Duke her reputation as the escort ship of the Royal Navy. For this effort, she was joined by a Wildcat helicopter from Yeovilton’s 815 Naval Air Squadron. “Russian warships are increasingly transiting through the English Channel,” said the UK’s Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard. “Alongside our commitment to NATO’s Eastern Sentry, this is a clear demonstration of how the UK stands firm with our NATO allies to deter Russian aggression.” The Royal Navy utilized a combination of radar and sensors to track the Russian vessels as they sailed through the North Sea and into the English Channel. The effort also involved assets from four NATO nations. “This type of tasking goes largely unseen, and as a ship’s company, we are extremely proud of our direct contribution to the UK’s national interests,” said Commanding Officer of HMS Iron Duke, Commander David Armstrong. The ships passed without incident. The Sparta IV was continuing to the Mediterranean, reports the Royal Navy. Near the Channel Islands and the island of Ushant, the Iron Duke handed over the monitoring of the cargo ship to a NATO ally. The Russian warship ended the escort and reversed course back through the English Channel. Iron Duke continued to monitor the vessel until it entered the North Sea. Iron Duke ended the monitoring on September 23, returning to its homeport.",Maritime Executive,25/09/2025 21:30:22

Young Crewmember Killed By Sliding Watertight Door Aboard Greek Ferry,https://maritime-executive.com/article/young-crewmember-killed-by-sliding-watertight-door-aboard-greek-ferry,,26/09/2025 00:12:13,,"A young cadet aboard the ferry Blue Star Chios was killed Wednesday when he got caught in a sliding watertight door, according to authorities in Piraeus. The 20-year-old crewmember was an engineering student, and had been aboard the ship as a wiper since September 15. He was properly certified for basic training, and had undergone familiarization while boarding the ship. The watertight door connected a ro/ro deck with the engine room, and the crewmember was passing through the open hatch when it closed and fatally injured him. His crewmates immediately responded to the scene and retrieved him to the hatch; their efforts to save him were not successful. The hatch had to be manually activated, and would stop moving as soon as the actuation lever was released, officials told local media; standing rules required the hatch to be fully open before passing through it to prevent any risk of getting caught. It is unclear why the door mechanism stayed activated and continued to close on the crewmember. Before completing an investigation, Greek authorities have decided to employ criminal statutes. The captain and the chief engineer have been arrested and face charges of ""manslaughter by negligence"" for the young crewmember's death. The accident was the second aboard Blue Star Chios this month. On September 18, a minor aboard the ferry sustained an electric shock after coming into contact with the cable for a spotlight on deck. The child was in stable condition and was transported to a hospital in Karpathos for observation.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
American Cruise Lines Launches First All U.S. Cruises on the Great Lakes,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/american-cruise-lines-launches-first-all-u-s-cruises-on-the-great-lakes,,26/09/2025 00:11:29,,"[By American Cruise Lines] Domestic U.S. Great Lakes cruises are now available. In response to guest demand, American Cruise Lines is proud to announce the debut of three Great Lakes itineraries for the 2026 cruise season. These brand-new cruises, sailing May through August 2026, will be operated aboard American Patriot, the newest small cruise ship in the country.“ Guests have long asked for our style of cruising on the Great Lakes,” said Charles B. Robertson, President & CEO of American Cruise Lines. “We are now proud to offer these cruises as only Americancan, aboard a new small ship sailing 100% domestically.” This announcement marks the first time in decades that an American ship will offer domestic cruises in the growing Great Lakes cruise market. Without the need to cross borders, the new cruises are a completely unique experience apart from all other cruise lines currently on the Lakes. Where other ships dock at ports intended for foreign ships and international entry, American Cruise Lines can dock in the heart of small towns, city parks, and private marinas for an authentic and exclusive experience not available with any other cruise line. American’s 2026 Great Lakes itineraries include a 9-Day cruise visiting the Thousand Islands and Niagara Falls, while an additional 9-Day itinerary highlights Lake Michigan, Green Bay inlet, and the wilderness of The Upper Peninsula. The Line’s signature 14-Day cruise, dubbed the American Great Lakes, travels 800 miles through three of the Great Lakes (Erie, Huron, and Michigan). All cruises offer an included pre-cruise hotel stay and complimentary domestic airfare. Each itinerary is comprised of days filled with excursions in small towns, and time spent cruising the magnificent Lakes. All itineraries begin, end, and remain in the U.S., making a passport or international flight unnecessary for American travelers. American Patriot is fully stabilized for smooth sailing and accommodates just 130 guests. The new ship features private balcony staterooms including Suites, and Singles available without Supplement, plus many amenities like spacious lounges including a top deck lounge and walking track, a main restaurant with views from every seat, a casual café, chart room, fitness center, laundry room, and elevators to all decks. American Cruise Lines foray into the Great Lakes will highlight 50 years of experience in developing and curating exceptional U.S. River cruises exploring domestic destinations and waterways. Each new itinerary offers included hotel stay, domestic air, onboard enrichment, and daily guided excursions. Fares also include everything on board the ship from fine cuisine and cocktails to Wi-Fi and gratuities. American’s Great Lakes cruise guests will relish the unparalleled comfort and elegance of the newest small ship in the region and the convenience of cruising to and from only U.S. ports of call.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
Cadeler Takes Delivery of WTIV Capable of Handling Foundations and Turbines,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cadeler-takes-delivery-of-wtiv-capable-of-handling-foundations-and-turbines,,25/09/2025 23:38:36,,"Wind Ally, a massive jack-up installation vessel, was delivered on September 25 to Cadeler as the company expands its capabilities and builds toward the largest fleet of jack-up installation vessels. The new ship, which is the first of three being built for Cadeler, has the ability to transition between foundation installation and wind turbines, creating greater efficiency for the projects. The naming ceremony took place at the Cosco shipyard in Qidong, China, on September 24, followed by the delivery of the vessel on September 25. The ship will depart shortly bound for the UK, where it is under contract to start the foundation installation for Ørsted’s Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm. When completed, the wind farm will have a generating capacity of 2.9 GW, making it the world’s single largest offshore wind farm to date. Wind Ally is a massive vessel with 5,600 square meters of deck space and the ability to carry a payload exceeding 18,000 tonnes. The vessel measures 162 meters (531 feet) in length and took more than two years to build. Its main crane is capable of lifting more than 3,300 tonnes at 39 meters. It can accommodate up to 130 crew and installation technicians. Cadeler highlights that the vessel was designed to meet the increasing size and complexity of offshore wind turbines and foundations. It will be able to transport up to six sets of XXL monopile foundations per load and install them. The A Class design is the result of close cooperation between Cadeler working with GustoMSC, NOV, Kongsberg, Huisman, and MAN Energy (Everllence). Wind Ally will be followed by sister ships Wind Ace in 2026 and Wind Apex in 2027. The company is also expanding its M class vessels, which are slightly smaller, dedicated foundation installation jack-up vessels. Wind Mover is due late this year after Wind Maker and Wind Keeper, which were delivered earlier this year. By mid-2027, Cadeler expects to be operating 12 vessels, giving it leadership in serving the offshore wind industry.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
India Commits $8B to Expand Shipbuilding Industry to Reach Top 5 Worldwide,https://maritime-executive.com/article/india-commits-8b-to-expand-shipbuilding-industry-to-reach-top-5-worldwide,,25/09/2025 22:21:56,,"The Indian government approved financing and a series of steps designed to support the ambitious plan outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to transform Indian shipbuilding to be among the top five worldwide. Calling shipbuilding the “mother of heavy engineering,” the government approved a total investment of just under $8 billion, including the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme scheduled to run until March 31, 2036. The Prime Minister highlights the critical nature of shipbuilding as part of the initiative to strengthen national, energy, and food security and to reinforce India’s geopolitical resilience and strategic self-reliance. Revitalizing India’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem, Modi says, will drive investment and create large numbers of new jobs both for domestic shipping and as an exporter of newbuilds. “India has a long and illustrious maritime history, with centuries of trade and seafaring that connected the subcontinent to the world,” the government news agency said announcing the adoption of the budget. “Today, the maritime sector remains a backbone of the Indian economy, supporting nearly 95 percent of the nation’s trade by volume and 70 percent by value.” The package, they said, introduces four pillars designed to strengthen domestic capacity, improve long-term financing, promote greenfield and brownfield shipyard development, enhance technical capabilities and skilling, and implement legal, taxation, and policy reforms to create a robust maritime infrastructure. Reports said that by giving infrastructure status to large ships, the government is providing tools to use them as collateral for loans. It will ensure easier and cheaper financing for the industry. At the heart of the program are three financing packages. They will provide nearly $2.8 billion for the shipbuilding financing initiative. Another nearly $2.3 billion will be in a maritime development fund, and a further $2.25 billion will be devoted to expanding domestic shipbuilding capacity to 4.5 million gross tons. A separate proposal, the Shipbreaking Credit Note scheme, incentivizes ship owners to recycle their vessels in India, offering a credit worth approximately 40 percent of the ship's scrap value, which can be applied within three years to building a new ship in India. Among the elements of the program that have been previously discussed are plans to develop new greenfield shipyards. The plan calls for clusters of shipbuilding capabilities to be developed around the country. The country’s large shipbuilders, including Cochin Shipyard, have already begun to develop international partnerships as they look to expand their capabilities to build larger ships. India has also been working to develop interest from the leading Western shipping companies, both for ship repair and construction. It has been linked to discussions with the largest container carriers, including MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, Maersk, and CMA CGM. The government highlights the massive amount of money India spends each year with foreign shipping companies. Prime Minister Modi is extolling a Made in India strategy to enhance the country’s economy and build greater self-reliance.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
Spain and Italy Send Warships to Escort Gaza Aid Flotilla,https://maritime-executive.com/article/spain-and-italy-send-warships-to-escort-gaza-aid-flotilla,,25/09/2025 22:05:07,,"Both Italy and Spain have announced plans to send naval vessels to escort a convoy of pro-Palestinian activists en route to Gaza, citing risks to their well-being after a series of apparent drone attacks. The Global Sumud Flotilla is a protest group with a mission to deliver baby formula, medicine and food to the beach in Gaza, symbolically breaching Israel's naval blockade on the territory. All previous attempts have ended in interdictions and arrests by the Israeli Navy, all in international waters far from Gaza. This latest mission set off from Barcelona on August 31, headed for a marshalling point in Tunisia. On September 8, while anchored off the small port of Sidi Bou Said, the group reported what its organizers believed to be a drone attack involving an incendiary device. A second, similar incident was reported on September 9. Undeterred, the group got under way for Gaza with a combined force of 50 small vessels - a mix of fishing boats, workboats and yachts, most under 100 feet in length. On September 24, the group reported another round of suspected drone attacks at a position south of Crete. More than a dozen unique occurrences were reported, including percussion grenades, radio jamming, and an apparently malicious VHF broadcast of a popular song by the band ABBA. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto condemned the attack and said that the Italian Navy frigate Alpino would be dispatched to provide an escort for security purposes, in addition to frigate Virginio Fasan. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez followed suit on Wednesday and said that his government would provide an additional warship, the Furor, a lightly-armed offshore patrol vessel. Both nations have citizens aboard vessels in the flotilla. ""The government of Spain demands that international law be complied with and that the right of its citizens to navigate the Mediterranean under safe conditions be respected,"" he said. Israel alleges that the flotilla has been infiltrated by terrorist group Hamas, and that it intends to carry goods to Gaza for Hamas' benefit. Israeli officials have instructed the flotilla's organizers to divert to Ashkelon and offload their supplies in port, where the goods could be loaded on trucks and added to the queue at Gaza's tightly-restricted land border with Israel. The flotilla's digital tracking platform shows that the boats have paused to regroup off the island of Koufonisi, off the southeastern end of Crete within Greek territorial seas. The tally suggests that so far, 42 vessels have arrived at this staging area.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12

The vessel had been away for 308 days, completing the annual trip to McMurdo Station and then to California for critical maintenance to keep the nearly 50-year-old vessel operational. “Much has been asked of this ship over the past five decades,” said Capt. Jeff Rasnake, Polar Star’s commanding officer. “The completion of this extensive five-year maintenance and recapitalization project is a major milestone in enabling Polar Star’s operations into the future.” Polar Star’s Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was completed in five phases, spaced so that the vessel could also undertake the yearly trip to Antarctica. The last phase of the program began on March 30, 2025. It was focused on updating the gyro repeater, replacement of ancillary pumps and motors critical to the main propulsion and auxiliary systems, and refurbishing the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Work completed in Phase Five took 175 days and represented an additional $12.7 million investment. Returning from Operation Deep Freeze, the vessel proceeded directly to Mare Island Dry Dock in Vallejo. While in the yard, they overhauled one of the nine main diesel engines, and work was performed on the ship’s sanitary systems. Additional major work completed includes removing the centerline shaft for servicing and inspection, exchanging all three propellers, and renewing both forward and aft main deck surfaces. Work on the rudder and props in April 2025 (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Seaman Nestor Molina) “This is a tremendous ship, and it is in better shape today than it was ten years ago,” said Rasnake.?“That’s a testament to the unrelenting efforts of the crew, the enduring support of our mission partners, and the renewed enthusiasm and investment in our nation’s polar icebreaking capabilities.” Commissioned in 1976, Polar Star is 399 feet (121 meters) in length and 13,500 tons displacement. Despite reaching nearly 50 years of age, Polar Star remains the world’s most powerful non-nuclear icebreaker with the ability to produce up to 75,000 shaft horsepower. The Coast Guard highlights the critical nature of keeping the vessel operational for the annual mission to transport personnel, equipment, and supplies to Antarctica. The efforts over the past few years have been designed to extend her service life until at least the first of the new Polar Security Cutters can be delivered. While Bollinger was approved this spring to proceed with full construction of the vessel to be known as USCGC Polar Sentinel, the program is at least six years behind schedule. The Coast Guard anticipates the first ship will not be delivered before 2030.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
Russian Warship Was Loitering Off Denmark During Drone Attacks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/russian-warship-was-loitering-off-denmark-during-drone-attacks,,25/09/2025 20:52:14,,"After a coordinated drone raid shut down Copenhagen Airport and grounded dozens of flights, investigators' attention quickly turned to possible maritime launch pads. Three Russia-linked vessels were in the general vicinity during or just after the attacks, and one of them appeared to have slowed down in order to time its arrival in the Oresund, just a few cables away from the airport. But a fourth vessel has also attracted attention: a Russian amphib, which has been loitering at the edge of Danish territorial seas for days. Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet first broke the news of the vessel's presence on Thursday. Using a chartered helicopter, the outlet's reporter flew out to observe the Ropucha-class landing ship Aleksandr Shabalin at a position off the coast of Langeland, an island at the southern entrance to the Great Belt. Shabalin was navigating with her AIS off, as is common for warships. According to the outlet, Shabalin has been in the area for days, during a time period of intense drone activity at Danish airports and military sites. Jacob Kaarsbo, former head analyst of Denmark's military intelligence service, told Ekstra Bladet that the ship could have served a few roles - as a diversionary measure, an observational platform, or as a backstop for Russia-linked merchant vessels involved in launching drones. Authorities in Denmark have confirmed that the Shabalin is part of the ongoing investigation into drone activity. As to the source of the drone raid, Danish authorities are for now holding back their opinions. But Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Thursday that there would likely be more attacks, and warned that ""what we are experiencing in Denmark at the moment is a hybrid war,"" similar to incidents seen elsewhere in Europe. The current head of Denmark's defense intelligence agency, Thomas Ahrenkiel, used a similar term Thursday in describing Russian methods. ""Since 2022 they have shown greater risk-taking in carrying out hybrid attacks,"" he said.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
China’s Dalian Shipbuilding Delivers its First LNG Newbuild,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-dalian-shipbuilding-delivers-its-first-lng-newbuild,,25/09/2025 20:48:06,,"Chinese shipbuilding’s efforts to chip away at South Korea’s domination of the LNG carrier market took another step forward as Dalian Shipbuilding delivered its first newbuild LNG carrier. The vessel is the first of eight being built for China Merchants Energy Shipping and is being highlighted as DSCI’s first independently designed vessel in this key segment of the industry. Parent company China State Shipbuilding Company hailed the vessel as part of the “crown jewel of the shipbuilding industry.” It highlights the “extremely high design and construction difficulty” for LNG carriers as another demonstration of China’s expanding expertise in shipbuilding. The handover celebration took place in Dalian on Wednesday, September 24. Chinese yards have begun to break into the LNG segment, building for both domestic carriers such as CMES and for export. They were successful in winning a few international orders linked to Qatar and its massive shipbuilding program. LNG carriers had traditionally been the domain of the South Korean yards, which still win the majority of the orders for these vessels. While they are highlighting the domestic shipbuilding capabilities, the new ship Sea Spirit uses the well-established GTT Mark III membrane containment system along with a reliquification unit. France’s Gaztransport & Technigaz (GTT) remains the supplier of the containment systems to the world’s carriers despite efforts to develop competing systems. The new ship is otherwise a fairly standard LNG carrier with a capacity of 175,000 cbm. DSIC highlights that by employing the standard size, the vessel will be able to dock at the vast majority of LNG terminals worldwide. They report the ship will have ""excellent port adaptability and ship-to-shore compatibility."" The ship is 295 meters (968 feet) in length. It is powered by an LNG dual-fuel low-speed main engine. China Merchants ordered its first LNG carriers from DSIC in 2022. The initial order was for two ships with options that were later exercised. The order has been expanded to eight ships, and they will operate through a number of joint ventures, including with PetroChina and Sinochem. In 2024, NYK announced the formation of its sixth shipmanagement company, OPearl, which it said would manage LNG carriers, including six vessels that will be chartered to CNOOC Gas and Power Singapore Trading & Marketing. China Merchants is a partner along with CETS Investment Management (HK) Co., a subsidiary of the CNOOC Group, in the management company. DSIC floated the first ship in May 2024 and reported that sea trials combined with gas trials were completed in July 2025. The yard has also launched Sea Navigator, Sea Creation, Sea Argosy, Sea Energy, and Sea Charity, as it works to fill out the order.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
Italian Coast Guard Detains Bulker for Hygiene and Crew Welfare Issues,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-detains-bulker-for-hygiene-and-crew-welfare-issues,,25/09/2025 19:33:00,,"The Italian Coast Guard and the port of Naples report that a bulker has been detained after its port state inspection due to a long list of concerns. They are citing issues ranging from hygiene in areas of the vessel and issues impacting crew welfare to mechanical and operational issues with the vessel. The bulker identified as the Tanais Dream (28,600 dwt) arrived in Naples on September 22 from Las Palmas. The vessel, which was built in 2003 and operates under the flag of Belize, is reported to have an all-Russian crew. After arriving in Italy, Guardia Costiera started a standard port state inspection, which media reports said developed into “a long and complex activity” as serious irregularities were identified. The reports state that the inspection revealed serious hygiene deficiencies in the crew cabins and public spaces on the vessel. They reported the presence of insects in the galley, provision areas, and mess. In addition, the cook is said not to have had the required certifications. The Coast Guard also raised concerns that the vessel did not have sufficient provisions aboard for the next voyage. In the mechanical areas of the ship, they are reporting issues with the heating and ventilation for the crew cabins. There were also leaks in the engine room reported to be coming from the main engine and the generators. The owners and operators of the vessel have been instructed to correct the deficiencies. Under the orders of the commander of the port of Naples and the regional maritime director, the coast guard reports that it will conduct a future inspection. Only when the issues have been corrected will they authorize the vessel to sail. The vessel has also been ordered to pay a €4,000 administrative fee. They may also be charge additional fees related to the detention administration. The Tanais Dream is reported to be carrying a load of cereal. At the end of last year, the ship drew attention when it arrived in Chattogram, Bangladesh carrying nearly 25,000 tons of rice, It was the first cargo of rice shipped between the countries. Based on historical records, it appears the ship has had a spotty track record with previous inspections. While it appears to be the first detention order, deficiencies have been cited in some inspections going back more than a decade. Last year, Turkish authorities cited the ship for 16 deficiencies, including multiple issues with working conditions aboard the vessel as well as documentation issues. The Italian Coast Guard highlighted the detention as the latest as it has increased its efforts. Since the beginning of the year, Guardia Costiera reports 37 control cases for foreign-flagged vessels. Top photo by Alf van Beem (public domain)",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12
France's Navy Seizes 10 Tonnes of Cocaine Off West Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/france-s-navy-seizes-10-tonnes-of-cocaine-off-west-africa,,25/09/2025 17:45:16,,"France's navy has completed a major cocaine bust in the trafficking lanes off the coast of West Africa, an increasingly important transshipment region for the drug supply chain from South America to Europe. Following a tip-off from British authorities and other international partners, two vessels of the Marine Nationale intercepted a stateless fishing vessel in the Gulf of Guinea, where France maintains a standing naval mission. Upon boarding, the interdiction team found 9.6 tonnes concealed aboard the vessel, a consignment valued at about $600 million if delivered to its final destination. ""The seamless cooperation between national and international actors in the fight against narcotics made this remarkable seizure possible. This event further illustrates the effectiveness of the French government's action at sea in protecting external borders,"" France's Maritime Prefect of the Atlantic said in a statement. Le 22.09, sous la direction du @premar_ceclant et du procureur de #Brest @justice_gouv, la @MarineNationale déployée en mission CORYMBE a procédé à la saisie de 9.6 tonnes de cocaïne au large de l'Afrique de l'ouest.  https://t.co/Q2Uwuvfq9F pic.twitter.com/fJwSn4kBkJ The bust was unusually large, but far from unusual in other respects. The service said that 54 tonnes of drugs have been seized in the area since the start of 2025. Balkan gangs reportedly dominate the ""Highway 10"" transatlantic trade lane along the 10th parallel, working in partnership with upstream cocaine suppliers like Brazil's PCC gang and midstream logistics brokers on the ground in Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde. ""Operations by Western Balkan criminal networks have contributed to making West Africa a pivotal EU-bound cocaine transshipment node – and the region continues to grow in importance for the global cocaine trade,"" said researcher Lucia Bird in a new report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. The drugs arrive from South America largely by non-containerized means (small workboats and yachts), sometimes transshipped to other craft at sea. On arrival on shore in Africa, the drug is forwarded to the European market in containerized shipments, packed and dispatched in ""legitimate"" boxes by West African front companies, according to Bird and her colleagues. Very little of the costly drug is sold to West African consumers, though the local market for crack and powder cocaine is growing. As elsewhere, illicit smuggling activity in the region fuels official corruption at seaports and government agencies, the researchers found. Gang personnel fleeing the criminal justice system in Europe may also be finding a new safe haven in West Africa, where they can avoid extradition, the report suggested. Latin American cocaine production has soared and spread since the mid-2010s, increasing supply and suppressing kilo prices at the source. Complementing this supply-side push factor, cocaine demand has skyrocketed in Europe, according to InsightCrime, creating a pull factor for transatlantic shipping.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 04:37:12

"Up, Up and Away!",https://maritime-executive.com/magazine/up-up-and-away,,26/09/2025 00:53:35,,"The first six months of the year were a rollercoaster of ups and downs and backs and forths as the markets seesawed between highs and lows. The lows came in mid-April, shortly after April 2 – so-called ""Liberation Day"" – when Trump unleashed a wave of threatened tariffs on the world. The highs came both before and after Liberation Day but mainly after as all three indices set new records. It was a nonstop blast, all right. For the record, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up over five percent for the six months while the Dow rose nearly four percent. Not earthshaking, but better than the alternative, especially in view of all the doomsday scenarios that rose up in response to a seeming unending series of crises. ""Nothing ever happens"" is the new meme on Wall Street. Despite wars, tariffs, spending bills, inflation, trade deficits, tax cuts – you name it – none of it seems to matter. Consumers and investors alike just shrug it off. The markets keep going up. So sit back and relax. Not to worry. In the end, it's all good. Here's how Randy Forsyth put it in a recent Barron's piece: But mainly, the first half gave rise to the investment meme of ""Nothing ever happens,"" insofar as the stock market is concerned. Trade wars and the uncertain impact of tariffs on the economy; fiscal fights over the Big, Beautiful tax bill that resulted in the U.S. losing its last triple-A credit rating; and conflicts in the Middle East, including the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites on June 22. After all of that, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are ending the first half at record highs. And he's optimistic about the second half of the year: Forget about the proverbial ""wall of worry"" that bull markets supposedly ascend. The new belief, ""Nothing ever happens,"" is actually relevant to stocks and helped induce individual investors to buy the steep dip in April and May, putting a lie to all the hand-wringing. By halftime, the mood had swung back to FOMO, or fear of missing out. CRYPTO & GOLD The seemingly blasé approach of investors in the equity markets is mirrored by crypto investors, but even more so, as they seem to have a blind faith in the coins' ability to go up. Take Bitcoin, for example. It was up about 15 percent in the first half of the year. Last year it rose a whopping 121 percent! It's currently trading around $120,000. Why bother with the equity markets when you can make money like that in crypto? And it will only get better as the Trump Administration legitimizes cryptocurrencies of all kinds and they begin trading on real exchanges. Well, they're already trading on real exchanges and being offered by blue-chip investment houses. You can even buy a Bitcoin ETF and brag to your friends that you're now ""into crypto."" Excuse me while I buy some more Coinbase (which, incidentally, is up more than 50 percent this year) and Robinhood (up 160 percent!). The real winner of the first six months was not stocks or crypto but, amazingly, gold. That stodgiest of investments was up 25 percent – on top of a 29 percent increase in 2024 – and is currently trading at around $3,300 an ounce, an all-time record. Since when do both gold and crypto outpace equities? Oh, and you can also buy gold as an ETF, and you don't have to tell anybody. Just keep it to yourself (like cash under the mattress, except in this case the cash is getting more valuable). So there seem to be two different things going on here – an appetite for risk (crypto) and an desire for safety (gold). That's at the extremes, and it's okay to do both, especially since they're outpacing traditional investments. In the middle are all the rest of us, plodding along in stocks and bonds. But that's where I want to be. I'll take my five percent in the first six months of the year – and another five percent between now and year-end – and live happily ever after. SHIPPING STOCKS So let's take a look at the wonderful world of maritime and see how some of these stocks did. Not so good, actually. And not unlike most of the market, for that matter. It's been a very narrow rally, really, limited largely to Big Tech and AI. The rest of the market, including shipping stocks, has moved in a limited range. And for good reason. Too much uncertainty, especially surrounding tariffs and trade, which directly affect shipping. If global trading volumes decline, as they will if some of the threatened tariffs go into effect, that will directly impact shipping. So don't look for any good news regarding the container, tanker, ro-ro and bulker trades. They will likely continue to stagnate. Offshore too, despite the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra, as the price of oil remains stuck in the mid-$60s and offshore wind flounders. ""Nothing ever happens"" has traditional shipping markets on edge – with one exception. Cruising. Given all the strife in the world today, people are looking for an escape, and cruise lines are the beneficiary. Two in particular – Viking and Royal Caribbean – are big winners. Let's start with Viking (VIK). The darling of Baby Boomers and the brainchild of Torstein Hagen, Viking's stock is up an impressive 30 percent so far this year and currently trades around $57. It's more than doubled from its IPO price of $24/share back in May 2024 and continues to generate solid earnings from its loyal base of affluent clients. As you cruisers out there well know, the company pioneered river cruising in Europe, starting more than 25 years ago, and has since expanded into small ship and ocean cruising worldwide. With a fleet of nearly 100 vessels, it's consistently voted #1 in its various categories (river, ocean, expedition) by upscale publications like Travel+Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler and has won numerous awards for excellence. It's a cruise line ""For the Thinking Person"" and features ""Experiences created for curious travelers."" It's famously noted for its TV advertising on programs like ""Masterpiece Theatre"" and ""Downton Abbey"" and was one of the first cruise lines of any type to advertise on TV. Royal Caribbean (RCL), #2 among cruise lines in terms of size, did even better. Its stock is up more than 50 percent this year and has doubled over the last 12 months, currently trading around $315. Can it go any higher? That's the big question. Many analysts think so and have price targets ranging as high as $400, and there are good reasons to be optimistic. It reported earnings recently and blew past estimates, earning more than $1 billion on revenues of $4.5 billion. ""The strong demand we are seeing across our new ships and land-based destinations reinforces that our strategy is working and resonating with today's traveler,"" noted Jason Liberty, President & CEO, in the company's earnings release. ""As consumer preferences continue to evolve – toward more frequent vacations, closer-in vacation planning, and a greater focus on meaningful, experience-driven travel – our experiences are designed to meet these evolving expectations. These trends, combined with our pipeline of bold, guest-centric initiatives, position us not only to create value for our shareholders, but to continue winning share of the growing $2 trillion global vacation market."" Sounds pretty upbeat to me! RCL even pays a dividend – a small one, I'll admit (75 cents/share) – but it's the only company among the major players to do so, and it's certainly a sign of confidence. NOTHING EVER HAPPENS So sit back, relax. Ignore all the ups and downs of tariffs, trade, wars and ceasefires, inflation and jobs reports. The market keeps going up. Nothing ever happens.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 09:30:58
ABS Chairman and CEO Unveils Vision for Intelligent Maritime Operations,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/abs-chairman-and-ceo-unveils-vision-for-intelligent-maritime-operations,,26/09/2025 00:53:30,,"The transformational impact of software on the performance of vessels and fleets was described by ABS Chairman and Chief Executive Christopher J. Wiernicki at a launch event in Greece for ABS Wavesight AdvantageTM, a powerful new intelligent platform. “In an industry where every ton and every ton-mile counts, ABS Wavesight Advantage puts the Power of One in your corner. What does that mean in practice? One percent of fuel savings through software-driven performance efficiencies delivers payback five times faster than retrofits. Reducing emissions by just one metric ton of CO? equivalent per voyage can save more than €200 in carbon penalties. Avoiding just one day of idle time can unlock $40,000 in potential earnings,” said Wiernicki. “You put this together and one metric ton of CO? saved per day combined with one day of increased utilization equals real impact, real fast. This is the kind of transformation software makes possible, not in theory, but in practice, every single day.” ABS Wavesight Advantage is a powerful new intelligent platform from ABS Wavesight, the ABS-affiliated software-as-a-service company. Built as a single source of truth, the platform connects vessels, shore teams, and systems—empowering maritime leaders to make smarter, faster decisions with confidence. “Consider the decarbonization equation,” added Wiernicki. “Approximately 70 percent of the challenge lies in fuel selection. The remaining 30 percent, energy efficiency and performance optimization, is where software has the most immediate impact. Given the limited availability of scalable green fuel options, this 30 percent represents the most actionable space for near-term progress. “In this context, software is not a cost center, it is a competitive advantage. It is the decarbonization fuel you can actually buy, and in many cases the smarter investment.” ABS Wavesight Advantage delivers a comprehensive suite of capabilities, including real-time validation, emissions benchmarking, pooling and a simplified process of submitting data for statutory verification to ABS through a convenient digital connection. By leveraging AI and predictive analytics, the platform enables users to optimize compliance strategies, reduce operational risk, and improve fleet-wide efficiency.

Methanol Plays Decarbonization Role in Very Large Ore Carrier Segment,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/methanol-plays-decarbonization-role-in-very-large-ore-carrier-segment,,26/09/2025 00:49:47,,"[By: Everllence] Qingdao Beihai shipyard has ordered 10 × Everllence B&W 7G80ME-LGIM (-Liquid Gas Injection Methanol) Mk 10.5 engines in connection with the construction of 10 × 325,000 dwt VLOC (Very Large Ore Carriers) for Chinese shipping companies, Shandong Shipping Corp. and Bohai Ocean Shipping Co Ltd. Each engine will come accompanied by an Everllence proprietary EGRTC (Exhaust Gas Recirculation – Turbocharger Cut-out) system for Tier III NOx compliance. Upon completion, the vessels will immediately go out on charter to Vale S.A., the Brazilian multinational company, sailing from Brazil to China with loads of iron ore. Bjarne Foldager, Head of Two-Stroke Business, Everllence, said: “Over the years we have experienced a wave of ME-LGIM orders and it is encouraging to see prominent players demonstrating their decarbonisation credentials in taking these vessels on charter. In a multi-fuel future, we expect methanol to figure prominently across all vessel segments and these newbuildings will be capable of trading carbon-neutrally when powered by green methanol.” Christian Ludwig, Head of Sales and Promotion, Everllence, said: “With more than 230 orders and over 600,000 running hours accumulated whilst running on methanol, the ME-LGIM engine has proven itself and become the de facto industry standard for the methanol propulsion of large merchant-marine vessels. As the engines are readily available and methanol dual-fuel types have a lower capital outlay compared to other, alternative fuel-propulsion solutions for ships, we fully expect to add even more orders within the bulk-carrier segment in the near future.”",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 09:30:58

"Everllence Confirms Running of Ethanol-Fuelled, Two-Stroke Engine",https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/everllence-confirms-running-of-ethanol-fuelled-two-stroke-engine,,26/09/2025 00:33:05,,"[By: Everllence] Everllence has confirmed the successful running on ethanol – at all load points – of a 90-bore ME-LGIM (-Liquid Gas Injection Methanol) engine in Japan. Everllence pioneered the ME-LGIM platform over a decade ago with the first commercial engine entering service in 2016 within the methanol-carrier segment. Building on experiences from these engines, Everllence scaled up its methanol burning portfolio in 2021 with the first ME-LGIM for a vessel outside the methanol carrier segment and now enjoys prominence as the best-selling, methanol-burning engine across all vessel segments with more than 225 units ordered for newbuildings alone and more than 50 engines in operation already. Building further on the ME-LGIM platform, the successful operation on ethanol means Everllence now has a fully operational engine with which to document ethanol capabilities. Ole Pyndt Hansen – Senior Vice President, Head of Two-Stroke R&D, Everllence – said: “The past few years have brought steadily growing interest in ethanol from the market. We always do our utmost to listen to these signals and have accordingly been carrying out the necessary design considerations for quite some time; this has provided us with a solid technical foundation. With this latest development, we now have the technical know-how from an actual running engine to take us to the next level. Our data confirms our earlier assumption that we could run our ME-LGIM engine on ethanol without issues.” Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business, Everllence – said: “It’s a proud moment to see yet another ‘first-ever’ for Everllence and that we, once again, have been able to draw on our company’s long engineering heritage. We already have five dual-fuel technologies in service along with an ammonia-powered engine that is on the verge of release. Our position as the world’s leading engine developer within the two-stroke marine segment means that we have a special obligation to push technologies and serve all markets in our efforts to decarbonise the global maritime industry. Now we need legislation in place that considers the case of ethanol as a viable fuel source, and we need a requisite market demand. At Everllence, the market speaks and we listen.” Michael Petersen – Senior Vice President, Head of PrimeServ Denmark – Everllence, said: “The successful conclusion of running in Japan means that we are now significantly closer to offering ethanol as retrofit product, especially on the S90 engines already equipped with ME-LGIM engine technology, just as our successful ME-GI, ME-LGIP and ME-LGIM retrofit offerings. As such we are eagerly awaiting further market input with regard to the viability of ethanol from commercial, application and bunkering perspectives. In general, introducing ethanol capability to retrofitted engines will bring those customers of ours wishing to pursue alcohol-burning engines – as their pathway to IMO-defined net-zero – to a similar technology-readiness and capability as those directly adopting from our existing engine portfolio.”",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 09:30:58
Port of Oakland Expands Digital Footprint with New App Dashboards,https://maritime-executive.com/corporate/port-of-oakland-expands-digital-footprint-with-new-app-dashboards,,25/09/2025 21:58:14,,"[By: Port of Oakland] The Port of Oakland has launched a suite of digital dashboards on its Oakland Portal website and mobile app, giving shippers, truckers, and community members better insight into how the port is operating in real time. The dashboards include Dwell Time, Empty Return Instructions, and Ocean Carrier Services and are designed to help businesses plan cargo moves more efficiently, reduce wasted trips, and improve supply chain reliability. “With these new dashboards, we’re giving our customers and partners the tools they need to keep cargo moving, said Port of Oakland Maritime Director Bryan Brandes. “Knowing how long containers are staying on the docks, where and when empties can be returned, and what ocean services are calling Oakland allows businesses to make better decisions, avoid delays, and ultimately reduce costs. This is another step toward a more efficient and transparent port, and we’re not done – more features are on the way.” The new dashboards include: “These improvements to the mobile app and website support real-time coordination across the supply chain, streamlining operations for the Port and its stakeholders,” said Mark Fialkowski, President, Infrastructure North America for Parsons. “FITS (Freight Intelligent Transportation System) implementation continues to be a team effort, and we are grateful to be part of the group of companies and agencies supporting the Port in improving operations. These new dashboards were developed using funding from the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) and builds on the Port’s FITS effort, which was launched in January 2024 with funding from the Alameda County Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). FITS is a collaboration between Alameda CTC, Port staff, the City of Oakland, and the California Department of Transportation. The Oakland Portal and mobile app is powered by Parsons’ award-winning advanced traffic management software (ATMS) solution, iNET®. The Port will continue working with its partners to deliver additional dashboards and tools designed to make port operations more predictable, efficient and sustainable for the entire supply chain.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 09:30:58

Containership Diverts to Korea After Fire is Contained,https://maritime-executive.com/article/containership-diverts-to-korea-after-fire-is-contained,,26/09/2025 15:48:28,,"Another underway containership is reporting a fire, which, in this case, its crew was able to contain. It again calls attention to the dangers of container fires and the industry’s efforts to manage the continuing threat. Zim reports that the vessel Colorado (65,924 dwt) suffered a fire while the vessel was beginning its Pacific crossing after port calls in China and Vietnam. The crew activated the emergency and fire procedures, and according to the report, the fire was brought under control. There were no injuries reported, but it is unclear the extent of damage that was incurred. The vessel has turned back as a precaution and is now bound for South Korea, where it will be inspected. AIS signals show that the Colorado is due to reach Busan on September 27. The containership was bound for California, where schedules say it was due on October 10. It is the second setback for Zim this month on its Pacific express operation. The company’s vessel Mississippi suffered a stack collapse in the Port of Long Beach, sending approximately 75 boxes into the harbor. Recovery operations are still underway in Long Beach. The Colorado was built in South Korea and entered service in 2024 owned by MPC Container Ships of Norway and operating under a seven-year charter to Zim. The ship is registered in Portugal and has a capacity of 5,500 TEU. MPC highlighted on its delivery that it is an eco-design vessel which emits approximately 20 percent less greenhouse gases compared to conventional designs and is prepared for a cost-efficient conversion in the future to operations on methanol. The World Shipping Council highlighted this month that port inspection data revealed that more than 11.39 percent of containers were found with deficiencies, ranging from misdeclared and undeclared dangerous goods, incorrect documentation, and improper packing. The industry trade group launched its Cargo Safety Program, an industry-led initiative using AI to review documentation to detect potentially misdeclared and undeclared dangerous goods in order to prevent ship fires, protect crews, vessels, customers’ cargo, and the marine environment.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 21:27:32
October Holds Potential to Dramatically Reshape Future of Shipping,https://maritime-executive.com/article/october-holds-potential-to-dramatically-reshape-future-of-shipping,,26/09/2025 15:31:20,,"The shipping industry is poised at a critical crossroads, and no matter what decisions emerge in October, they will dramatically reshape the future of the industry. Not only is the International Maritime Organization (IMO) seeking member adoption of its decarbonization framework, but the United States is poised to take a series of actions to support its merchant marine that will have wide-ranging ramifications globally. Speaking at the 60th meeting of the Houston Marine & Energy Insurance Conference this week, Jeanne M. Grasso, Partner at the prestigious Blank Rome law firm, outlined the myriad of issues scheduled to reach critical decision points in the coming weeks. She advised the audience to stay tuned and pay close attention, as many unresolved issues should be coming to critical points. Grasso notes that shipping has come to the forefront and is gaining new visibility “like never before” as the U.S. administration has pursued its tariff policy along with Western nations' efforts at sanctions against the shadow fleet of tankers. She notes that despite playing a critical role in global commerce, the shipping industry is mostly invisible to the broader public and lawmakers except during high-profile casualties or the supply chain crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the issues scheduled to reach inflection points are the fees announced by the U.S. Trade Representative for Chinese-built, owned, or operated ships, as well as the continuing overhang of tariffs on the shipping industry. The IMO meets in mid-October, where member States will vote on its Net-Zero Shipping Framework. In addition, delivery of the first of the reports on shipping specified by Donald Trump in his Executive Order on Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance is due in October, followed by a second one in November, while the U.S. Congress has had the SHIPS for America Act before it, but has yet to start hearings. In addition, the Federal Maritime Commission is pursuing two investigations, which may result in potential remedial actions, looking at the impact of flag of convenience states on U.S. trade, and the major ports and regions that are choke points and how they potentially impact U.S. trade. The shipping industry is beginning to take steps to adapt to the USTR’s fees for Chinese-owned ships, Chinese-operated ships, or Chinese-built ships, as well as the fees on all foreign-flag car and vehicle carriers. Grasso notes, however, that the final interpretations and clarifications of the rules have not been released three weeks ahead of when the fees are due to begin. She said the USTR and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have promised publication of an FAQ and other information documents, which are eagerly anticipated. Grasso notes a lot of confusion and questions among clients over the rules as they wait for clarification. Large carriers have reported they are shifting fleet deployments where possible, and Grasso notes some companies are considering restructuring based on the details released, such as the definition of “Chinese-owned” at 25 percent Chinese investment. There have been rumors of legal challenges to the USTR, and especially complaints that the regulations on vehicle carriers are an overreach beyond the authority Congress gave the USTR. So far, no challenges have been filed. Equally critical is the IMO push for adoption of the decarbonization framework, which addresses operating targets and a global fee structure for failing to meet the targets. Many parts of the shipping industry have called for a pause to resolve issues within the framework, but Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, speaking two weeks ago at the presentation of the DNV Maritime Outlook, expressed confidence that the adoption will proceed. The U.S. came out strongly opposing the decarbonization efforts. Trump has threatened additional tariffs or other penalties for countries if the framework is adopted. Grasso highlights the questions over what the U.S. might do and how it could impact global trade if adopted. Also, could individual countries act to create a fragmented regulatory environment if the framework is not adopted? Trump gave his departments of Commerce, Transportation, Defense, and Homeland Security 180 days to complete a report following his executive order on maritime dominance. The order also requires a Maritime Action Plan within 210 days. His effort, however, also dovetails with the SHIPS for America Act, which, while it has broad bipartisan support, has not proceeded in the U.S. Congress. Grasso notes other challenges to the U.S. initiatives to rebuild the merchant marine. The Maritime Administration still does not have a new administrator appointed by the Trump administration and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. This month, the administration nominated two people to fill vacancies on the board of the Federal Maritime Commission, but they require Congressional approval, and the administration has not yet designated a chairman for the commission after the end of Louis Sola’s term on June 30. Highlighted repeatedly during the two days of presentations at the Houston conference was that the shipping industry does not like uncertainty and a lack of stability. Right now, there is a broad range of uncertainties overhanging the industry, but some clarity could appear in October. Grasso notes that the varying issues will need to come together to provide clarity and to advance the U.S. agenda of restoring its commercial shipping industry.",Maritime Executive,26/09/2025 21:27:32
