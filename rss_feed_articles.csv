"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Iain Macneil MNM and Kat Heathcote Macneil MBE return to their roots with the announcement of a new CBT Joint Venture initially focussing on the burgeoning Maritime Security Sector. Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Great Lakes Announces the Delivery of its Newest Hopper Dredge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/great-lakes-announces-the-delivery-of-its-newest-hopper-dredge,,22/08/2025 18:43:30,,"[By Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp.] Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (""Great Lakes"" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GLDD), the largest provider of dredging services in the United States, today announced it took delivery of its newest Jones Act-compliant hopper dredge, the Amelia Island from the Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, Louisiana.

MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Mano Cruises Crown Iris was forced to skip ports and has also reported delays as protestors vented their anger over the war during the ship’s port visits.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
China Coast Guard Up-Guns its Presence at Scarborough Shoal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-coast-guard-up-guns-its-presence-at-scarborough-shoal,,22/08/2025 01:09:58,,"The China Coast Guard has up-gunned its patrol forces at Scarborough Shoal after a series of high-profile security developments at the reef, including an embarrassing collision between a Chinese PLA Navy warship and a China Coast Guard cutter earlier this month. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Hurricane Erin Creates Risk for Shipping off U.S. East Coast,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hurricane-erin-creates-risk-for-shipping-off-u-s-east-coast,,21/08/2025 03:50:54,,"The outer bands of Hurricane Erin have reached the coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic states, bringing risks to shipping and to the general public in beachfront communities. Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines.

In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre.

We look forward to sharing our vision and meeting with global maritime and logistics leaders during this innovative conference and exhibition” he added. Bahri's commitment to excellence is evidenced by its recent significant investments in fleet expansion. In August 2024, the company secured a landmark $1 billion deal to acquire nine Very Large Crude-oil Carriers (VLCCs) from Capital Marine and Trading Cooperation, reinforcing its position as one of the largest VLCC operators worldwide. This acquisition was part of a broader fleet modernization initiative that sees Bahri operate an impressive fleet of 103 owned vessels, and three floating desalination barges. Bahri's strategic vision extends beyond fleet expansion to include the development of a comprehensive maritime ecosystem within Saudi Arabia. The company has formed strategic partnerships with key national entities to strengthen the Kingdom's maritime capabilities including: a strategic Letter of Intent with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma'aden) to explore collaboration opportunities for localizing maritime industries and developing resilient supply chains; partnership with the Saudi Logistics Academy to enhance employment opportunities and skills development in the maritime logistics sector, and expansion of Bahri Ship Management's service portfolio to provide technical ship management and crewing services to other maritime operators. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey toward becoming a global maritime cluster under Vision 2030, Bahri stands at the helm, navigating the Kingdom toward a prosperous and sustainable maritime future on the world stage. This year’s Saudi Maritime Logistics Congress is organised by Seatrade Maritime, part of Informa Markets and with Founding Strategic Partner, Bahri, alongside Main Partners, Mawani, and TGA. According to Chris Morley, Group Director, Seatrade Maritime, “The maritime industry represents a crucial component of Saudi Arabia's ""blue economy"" strategy, which recognizes the potential for significant returns on maritime investments as part of the broader economic transformation agenda. Our objective is to showcase the phenomenal opportunities available through collaborations with both national and international companies, as well as deep dive into the multiple ongoing projects. The conference agenda will spotlight investment, innovation and sustainability amongst other key topics and bring together over 100 regional and international experts.” “Our ultimate aim is to facilitate fruitful cooperation between the public and private sector entities that catalyses growth for our industry.” Morley concluded. The two-day event includes both an international exhibition and a detailed conference programme spread across two stages with multiple free-to-attend sessions. The sixth edition in the annual cycle follows on from a record-breaking 2024 which saw more than 10,000 visitors converge on Dhahran Expo to do business and gain up-to-date knowledge from industry specialists.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa. Russia also struck the oil refining and gas transportation infrastructure in the Poltava region in central Ukraine.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas. Leading by Example “Port Tampa Bay believes nature and industry can coexist,” said Paul Anderson, Port Tampa Bay President & CEO. “Our partnership with DarkSky illustrates our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. We’re proud to help pioneer this important program and guide the maritime industry toward more sustainable practices.” Throughout 2024, DarkSky and Port Tampa Bay engaged lighting designers, marine infrastructure experts, and environmental advocates to ensure the program meets both operational needs and ecological goals. The resulting guidelines are now available for adoption by other ports and marine facilities worldwide.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Towboat Hits Bridge On Colombia's Magdalena River,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towboat-hits-bridge-over-colombia-s-magdalena-river,,20/08/2025 00:00:08,,"On Sunday morning, a large towboat hit a bridge over the Magdalena River at Barrancabermeja, a refinery town about 160 miles north of Bogota, Colombia. At about 0615 hours, the towing vessel Ciudad de Medellin was operating near the Guillermo Gaviria Bridge, upriver from the Ecopetrol refinery. The river was rising due to heavy rains, and video from the scene shows that the current was running strong. While attempting a turn, the towboat had a hard allision with a bridge pier, resulting in extensive damage to the vessel. The top of the pilothouse was cut off as the towboat passed under the bridge. No injuries were reported, and good Samaritans arrived swiftly to help the crew. Video footage from the immediate aftermath suggests that the towboat took on water and listed to starboard after the casualty. The vessel partially sank by the stern by the time salvors arrived.

The towboat appears to have been outside of the navigation channel, according to local fishermen; the causes are under investigation. The operating company is arranging for a salvage operation to remove the wreckage and ensure safety of navigation. Ciudad de Medellin is a 2,000-horsepower towboat operated by Naviera Rio Grande.

Bulk of Oil Removed During Salvage of MSC Baltic III in Canada,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulk-of-oil-removed-during-salvage-of-msc-baltic-iii-in-canada,,19/08/2025 23:26:04,,"The Canadian Coast Guard signaled a milestone in the ongoing salvage operation for the MSC Baltic III, which grounded five months ago during a fierce winter storm off Newfoundland, Canada. After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

When Atlantic Treasure started taking on water overnight Sunday, the crew of the nearby fishing vessel Maid Of Amsterdam answered their mayday call and brought them to safety within hours. The Atlantic Treasure was under way on a fishing trip to the Grand Banks over the weekend. Late Sunday, the vessel suddenly began taking on water at a fast rate - possibly from a burst pipe, skipper Noah Deveau told CBC. Deveau had three crewmembers deploy the liferafts and gather all needed survival gear, then turned everyone else to the task of attempting to save the ship. The flooding overwhelmed the bilge pumps, and within a short period of time the Atlantic Treasure was taking water on deck. When the power to the pumps went out, Deveau had the crew abandon ship into the life raft while the deck lights were still lit. All hands made it safely aboard the raft and away from the sinking vessel. Deveau got a mayday out before abandoning ship, and Maid Of Amsterdam's skipper responded. The Amsterdam was about three hours away, headed back to port ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Erin. It diverted to meet up with the drifting raft, and in calm surface conditions, all Atlantic Treasure crewmembers transferred over safely and headed back for Nova Scotia. The timing of the rescue was fortunate: Hurricane Erin is expected to pass off the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on Saturday with winds of about 80-100 knots.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Bulker Suffers Cargo Hold Explosion in Baltimore Harbor,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulker-suffers-cargo-hold-explosion-in-baltimore-harbor,,19/08/2025 04:19:15,,"On Monday night, a major explosion and fire occurred aboard a bulker in the Port of Baltimore's inner harbor, three miles from the site of the former Francis Scott Key Bridge. At 1830 hours local time, the vessel W Sapphire (IMO 9605645) was departing the CSX Curtis Bay coal pier in laden condition. Just off the dock, the vessel sustained a massive explosion in the forward hold, followed by a fire. A web cam operated by StreamTime captured video of the event, with some of the elements of the Key Bridge visible in the background. Multiple firefighting vessels responded immediately to the scene and began response efforts. According to the Baltimore City Fire Department, no injuries were reported on board, but the vessel sustained signs of explosion and fire damage. The fire has been extinguished and plans for the vessel are still being arranged, according to the Coast Guard. The captain of the port has established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the vessel. The cause of the blast is under investigation. Coal cargoes have known fire and explosion risks related to methane emissions, with the degree of risk varying by type of coal and the ventilation of the hold. The incident may resurface longstanding concerns about health and safety in fenceline communities around the 140-year-old coal pier. In a study published last month, researchers from Johns Hopkins found that ""the coal terminal is a significant driver of air pollution burdens"" in the Curtis Bay community. An on-terminal explosion occurred in 2021, caused by ""a localized build up of methane within the conveyor belt tunnel used to load coal to ships,"" according to the operator. The blast resulted in an airborne coal dust release, neighborhood complaints, a temporary shutdown and a $1.75 million settlement agreement. The coal pier is one of CSX's largest, and the rail company says that it is economically vital. ""It's important for both the global economy by ensuring coal reaches the market, and for our customers and the health of their business,"" said John Healy, CSX director of sales for export coal, in a statement last year.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Sir Anish Kapoor Designs Offshore Sector's First Public Art Installation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/sir-anish-kapoor-designs-offshore-sector-s-first-public-art-installation,,19/08/2025 03:59:56,,"Working with Greenpeace UK, sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor CBE has completed an unauthorized and potentially illegal modern art installation at a platform in the North Sea. It may be the first piece of ""fine art"" - designed and conceived by a figure from the modern art world - ever to debut aboard an offshore oil and gas structure, Greenpeace said in a statement. Kapoor, known best for public installations like ""The Bean"" on the Chicago waterfront and the ""Orbit"" sculptural tower in London, has a background in stainless steel and structural steel artworks, so the choice of a steel offshore platform is within keeping for his work. For the debut of this piece, Kapoor selected the Skiff wellhead platform, an outlying facility at the Brigantine gas field cluster. The platform is located in the North Sea about 60 nautical miles northeast of Bacton, a town on Britain's Norfolk coast. Without authorization from facility owner Shell, Greenpeace UK mobilized a climb team, a large canvas, and a 40-foot-tall ""frame"" of aluminum tubing to the Skiff site. In foggy but calm summer weather, the team boarded the platform from a RIB, assembled the frame and stretched the canvas across it. Then they hoisted a high-pressure hose to the top and sprayed about 250 gallons of food-based nontoxic dye onto the fabric, completing Kapoor's design.

Drunken Yacht Skipper Arrested Twice for Endangering Shipping in Rostock,https://maritime-executive.com/article/drunken-yacht-skipper-arrested-twice-for-endangering-shipping-in-rostock,,19/08/2025 02:39:57,,"Last week, a local yacht skipper landed in trouble with police in Rostock for drunk boating and endangering marine traffic - twice. On Wednesday, the skipper ran his eight-meter sailboat into a pier in Rostock's harbor. The pier happened to be near a turning point for ferry traffic, and the casualty - while minor in itself - forced the ferry Skane to halt a planned turn, according to VesselTracker. For any merchant vessel, this can become a dangerous situation: if an unexpected obstacle forces the pilot and master to deviate from the passage plan, the other alternatives may be less than ideal. The yacht sustained minor damage in the allision with the pier, but no water ingress. The state water police administered a breathalyzer test to the skipper upon responding to the scene. The 54-year-old man had a blood alcohol level of about 0.3 percent (BAC), consistent with severe intoxication, and the police filed charges against him for endangering shipping. While that investigation got under way, the man was released and allowed to return to his yacht. Two days later, his boat was spotted adrift in Dierkow Bay, headed for shore and apparently not under command. According to local outlet Focus, good Samaritans woke the man up by shouting and helped to secure the boat. Once again, police administered a breathalyzer test, and this time the skipper's blood alcohol level measured about 0.1 percent (BAC) - lower than before, but still well in excess of Germany's drunk-driving limits for motor vehicles. The run-in earned the man a second charge of endangering shipping traffic.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Protesters Block Asbestos-Removal Project for Classic Ferry at Brodosplit,https://maritime-executive.com/article/protesters-block-asbestos-removal-project-for-classic-ferry-at-brodosplit,,19/08/2025 01:55:28,,"Brodosplit Shipyard has landed in hot water with local residents over plans for restoring an aging cruise ship, the Moby Drea. The vessel has asbestos partition panels inside, and the shipyard's work plan called for removing them - but local citizens were not interested in the perceived risks, and pressed successfully for a government order for the ship's removal. Moby Drea (ex names Tor Britannia, Prince of Scandinavia) is a 1975-built cruise ferry, originally designed with fine lines and high speeds in mind. In service in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, the vessel made up to 27 knots with four Pielstick diesels. A 1998 refit added more steel amidships, increasing bed capacity, broadening the beam by about 10 feet and raising gross tonnage by about 6,000 GT. The cruise ferry is now 50 years old, well past the age for demolition for most commercial vessels. As recently as May, the ship was reported sold for delivery to Aliaga, Turkey for scrap value. However, on July 22, Croatian shipyard Brodosplit announced that it would be accepting Moby Drea into its facility for specialized asbestos removal work. Two days later, Shipping Italy confirmed that the vessel will be cleaned of asbestos, then moved to Piraeus for a refit for continued commercial service. The new owner is reportedly a bunkering company based in Messina, Med Fuel. The Moby Drea's interior contains metal partition panels with an asbestos core, amounting to about 350 tonnes of asbestos in total; the work will be performed by a contractor focused on this specific line of work, with special post-removal handling to minimize risk of environmental contamination. The ship arrived at Brodosplit under tow in late July, and its berthing was approved by local port authorities. But the project immediately met a speed bump: a citizens initiative to halt the work. The group organized protests outside the shipyard's gates in an attempt to prevent work from going forward, and it filed a petition with Croatia's government to demand the ship's removal, questioning whether the Moby Drea is undergoing repair or has another ultimate fate. For its part, Brodosplit said that the asbestos was fully encased in the panels and would be handled and disposed of safely. Air testing on board the ship was carried out and detected no sign of contamination before the start of work, the firm said in a statement to local media. Local sensitivities are high because of the region's history. Vranjic, a small town near Split, was once the site of a large asbestos construction material factory; the area has considerable experience with the dangers, including hundreds of fatalities over the decades. The public memory of trouble with asbestos is still alive and well, and - any statistical risk profile for the specifics of the Moby Drea project aside - protesters have expressed a strong desire to avoid returning to those days. Croatia's Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure has sided with residents and issued an order for the vessel's prompt removal from Brodosplit. The Moby Drea must be towed out of Croatia and its territorial seas by early September. Owner Med Fuel confirmed that on receipt of the stop work order on August 11, all construction activity was suspended, and none of the asbestos panels will be removed going forward. The owner is now solely focused on securing a safe tow to get Moby Drea out of Croatia, and the ministry has granted it an additional 15 days to complete the task. Split's port authority is assigned to oversee compliance. Top image: Moby Drea (Lucarelli / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Data Sector Consolidation for Shippers as Xeneta Buys eeSea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/data-sector-consolidation-for-shippers-as-xeneta-buys-eesea,,19/08/2025 01:05:47,,"The consolidation of the maritime data sector is continuing with freight and data logistics company Xeneta buying maritime and supply chain intelligence company eeSea. The move reflects the increasing sophistication of the shipping sector as companies increasingly use data to manage rapidly shifting markets. By adding eeSea’s market-leading global schedule, transit time, and reliability data to their existing range of freight rate data, Xeneta says it will enable BCO Procurement teams to manage freight contracts and suppliers based on service levels, and not just cost. They said to customers that it will help them to get the right service at the right price, no matter what the market conditions. “Coming together with eeSea, and combining our data and skills, furthers our shared mission to bring transparency and efficiency to how ocean freight is bought and sold,” said Patrik Berglund, Xeneta CEO. He said they would be able to provide customers with more actionable intelligence to control freight spend, as well as delivery reliability. Founded in 2012, Xeneta rose to prominence in the shipping community with its freight rate benchmarking and market analytics platform. More recently, it has increased its market analytics including adding well-known analyst and commentator Peter Sand to the team. It points to increasing challenges for shippers who need visibility on freight rates, contracts, and delays. It points to recent factors ranging from tariffs to wars, geopolitical challenges, and carriers' response with blank sailings and increased transshipment, as well as factors such as port congestion, all challenging shippers. “A true partnership between carriers and cargo owners relies not only on the freight rates paid, but also on the operational performance provided by the carrier, such as transit times, reliability, canceled sailings, weekly stability, and schedule forecasting accuracy,” says eeSea founder and CEO Simon Sundboell. eeSea was started a decade ago and has built its services focused on maritime and supply chain intelligence.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
The Launch of a Pure Battery-Powered EV Harbor Tugboat Development Project,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-launch-of-a-pure-battery-powered-ev-harbor-tugboat-development-project,,19/08/2025 00:56:27,,"[By: Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd.] Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Yokohama; President & CEO: Hiroyuki Saito, hereinafter “Tokyo Kisen”) and Marindows Inc. (Head Office: Tokyo; CEO: Yasumasa Suetsugu, hereinafter “Marindows”) have officially launched Japan’s first pure battery-powered EV harbor tugboat development project. This EV harbor tugboat which will be operated in the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki is aiming to contribute to “zero GHG emissions from the ports” in accordance with the Carbon Neutral Port (CNP) policy. In January 2023, Tokyo Kisen put into service “TAIGA” which was the Japan’s first series-hybrid electric-powered tugboat equipped with a large-capacity 2,486 kWh battery. Building on two and a half years of operating experience with electric-powered tugs, this project advances to the next stage—enabling truly zero-emission (zero CO?) operations—by developing and constructing a pure battery-powered EV tugboat. This could be possible by the combination of a large-capacity onboard battery system (6.66 MWh) and MW-class fast chargers. Project and Vessel Overview Planned Schedule 2025: Detailed feasibility study and concept design. (Final construction decision will be made based on the results of the detailed FS including the concept design.) 2026: Basic design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2027: Detailed design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2028: Construction starts of the vessel and fast-charging pier works. 2030: Commercial service starts at the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Seaspan and CSSC Complete Big Order Chinese-Financed in Local Currency,https://maritime-executive.com/article/seaspan-and-cssc-complete-big-order-chinese-financed-in-local-currency,,19/08/2025 00:23:32,,"Seaspan became the latest to jump into containership newbuilding, placing another big order with China State Shipbuilding. In addition to the size of the order, estimated by analysts at more than $1.2 billion, it is drawing attention as it is Chinese-financed and will be denominated in the Chinese currency, renminbi, extending China’s efforts to break free from linking newbuilds to the U.S. financial markets. As the largest independent containership leasing company, Seaspan rivals the largest carriers. It currently reports a capacity for its owned fleet of approximately 2.4 million TEU, which rivals Hapag-Lloyd as the first largest carrier by capacity. However, Seaspan’s fleet operates mostly on long-term charters to the major carriers. The company reports a fleet of 227 vessels (fully delivered, including current construction orders) and a 99 percent utilization rate. The new order is for a dozen 9,000 TEU ships to be financed by ICBC Financial Leasing. During the signing ceremony on August 15 at CSSC’s Hudong-Zhonghau Shipbuilding subsidiary, they highlighted the deal as a “prime example of the integrated development of “Made in China + China Financed,” which is a not-so-veiled response to the U.S.’s efforts to impose port fees on Chinese-built or operated vessels. CSSC hailed the order as “creating a new model for international ship trading.” There was no indication of which of Seaspan’s major customers will be the operator of the new ships, which are due for delivery by 2029. They said the ships will be conventionally fueled but have a mature linear design, an efficient powertrain, and a refined layout to maximize cargo space. Seaspan has grown rapidly and continues its pace since being taken private in an investor-led deal with management and participation by Ocean Shipping Network (ONE). In May, it was linked to a letter of intent for six 11,400 TEU vessels for COASCO. It is also reported to be building six methanol-ready 8,300 TEU vessels for COSCO.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Video: American SailGP Boat Suffers High-Speed Collision,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-american-sailgp-boat-suffers-high-speed-collision,,18/08/2025 23:08:53,,"America’s boat in the Rolex SailGP Grand Prix Season 25 event taking place in Sassnitz, Germany, over the weekend, suffered a catastrophic collision with its British rival. The boats were closing, each travelling at over 40 mph in heavy winds, when the collision occurred and caused significant damage. The American boat, which was sailing on port and therefore did not have priority, had its front hull sliced off by the rudder of the British boat. Luckily, and by the narrowest of margins, there were no casualties. In the spirit of the competition, the British boat was repaired overnight and sailed the next day with material salvaged from the American boat. The U.S. boat is owned by a group of high-profile sports star investors, chaired by founding Uber engineer Ryan McKillen. Damage after the high-speed collision (SailGP) Boats representing 12 countries are competing in a racing series that, like Formula 1 car racing, travels the world. The competition was founded by Russell Coutts and Larry Ellison in 2018. Events in the 2025 season have already taken place in Dubai, Auckland, Sydney, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Portsmouth, and Sassnitz, with races still to come in St Tropez, Geneva, Cadiz, and the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The F50 catamarans regularly reach speeds of over 60 mph when up on hydrofoils, with racecourses optimized for spectators viewing the racing on land. Each team competes with an identical boat, meaning that results are based on the skill of the crews and tactics adopted. The hydrofoils and rudders used on the boats are made of higher modulus carbon fiber, the strength of which was evident in the collision between the two boats last weekend. The hydrofoils are designed to delay the onset of cavitation, when air bubbles create friction and drag resistance. Crashes and capsizes are rare, but are high-impact events when they occur because of the speeds involved. Halfway through the 2025 series, Australia, New Zealand, and Spain are in the top three places, with the American boat falling out of contention, having started the weekend’s sailing at Sassnitz strongly.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Wan Hai 503 Remains at Sea 10 Weeks Seeking Port of Refuge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wan-hai-503-remains-at-sea-10-weeks-seeking-port-of-refuge,,18/08/2025 22:43:44,,"Ten weeks after the fire was reported aboard the containership Wan Hai 503, the vessel remains at sea in search of a port of refuge. It has turned into the vessel no one wants, as India almost immediately said it would not permit its ports to receive the ship, and more recently, Sri Lanka declined the application made for the vessel’s refuge. Owner/operator Wan Hai Lines issued its most recent update at the end of last week, reporting the vessel is stable and being monitored. “We, in close coordination with our appointed experts and the salvage team, are in the process of liaising with potential ports of refuge,” reported Wan Hai. “Decisions on the final port of refuge will take into account the overall suitability for the vessel as well as the handling of fire-damaged cargo.” The fire began on June 9 while the vessel was in India’s EEZ as it was sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Nhava Sheva, India. The Indian Coast Guard responded, assisting in the evacuation of the crew and an extensive firefighting effort. After salvage teams got secure tow lines, India, however, ordered the ship taken further out to sea, fearing a repeat of incidents such as the loss of X-Press Pearl and the ongoing problems after the MSC Elsa 3 sank weeks before the Wan Hai fire. As of July 24, India reported the vessel was outside its zone and that it was relinquishing involvement to the Maritime & Ports Authority of Singapore as the vessel’s flag state. Conditions aboard the vessel had dramatically improved with no more flames and only residual smoke in bays 29 to 35. Twenty salvers were reported aboard the ship, continuing cooling efforts and undertaking dewatering efforts. Conditions aboard as of mid-July (DGS) Wan Hai has continually reported since the end of July that the fire is extinguished and that teams continue to improve the onboard situation. However, Hapag-Lloyd, which shared cargo aboard the ship, confirmed on August 13, “The request for a port of refuge in Sri Lanka has been declined by the authorities.” They said the ship was 130 nautical miles from the Indian coast (Cape Comorin). The plan was to move it further out to sea while discussions continued on a port of refuge. This has continued, although the area is subjected to monsoons at this time of year. There is no clear determination for the direction of the ship and a potential resolution. It has been suggested it might be towed to the Middle East. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which suffered a container fire off the Indian coast, ended up gaining refuge at Khor Fakkan, in the UAE, in September 2024, about seven weeks after its fire started. That vessel, also, was not a constructive loss and returned to service. Similar salvage efforts to what are required for the Wan Hai 503 were recently completed in the Port of Aberdeen, Scotland, after the Solong was towed there after the collision and fire in the North Sea. The hulk was cleared of its debris in Scotland and arrived last week at a recycling facility in Belgium. Although a lot has been incinerated during the fire on the Wan Hai 503, the concerns raised continue to be about potential pollutants and the danger of the ship sinking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Lost and Found: Navy Yard Logbook From the Pearl Harbor Attack,https://maritime-executive.com/article/lost-and-found-navy-yard-logbook-from-the-pearl-harbor-attack,,18/08/2025 22:32:10,,"By miraculous coincidence, conservators at the U.S. National Archives have recovered the logbook for Pearl Harbor Naval Base for the period before and after the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. It is the only record of its kind from the ""date which will live infamy,"" and it was nearly lost to a trash bin before finding its way into private hands, according to the previous owners. The logbook covers the status of vessels in the yard during the period from March 1941 to June 1942, a period of extremely rapid and momentous events. During the time period when the first entries, the U.S. was on a peacetime footing and was in diplomatic talks with Japan; nine months later, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entered the war; and by the end of the logbook, just seven months further on, the U.S. Navy won strategic victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, and was gearing up to retake the Solomon Islands. The log nearly didn't make it. According to Michael William Bonds, who inherited it from his mother Oretta Kanady, the recordbook somehow ended up at Norton Air Force Base in California, where Kanady worked as a civilian employee in the 1970s. Bonds told the Washington Post that Kanady found the logbook in a trash bin and asked if she could take it home. It wasn't classified, and she received permission. Bonds took possession of it when she passed in 2000, and has had it in storage ever since. Only recently did he realize what it was, and its exceptional historical value. The record documents moments of tragedy and triumph for Pacific Fleet. It notes the untimely arrival of USS Oklahoma and USS Arizona on December 5, just in time for their destruction at the hands of Japanese pilots two days later. On the page for December 7, it details the time of arrival of the first Japanese aircraft, and the time of arrival and departure of Navy warships in response to the strike (top). On the morning of December 8, as salvors dealt with the aftermath of the attack, the log noted that the capsized hull of the battleship USS Utah ""appears to be drifting out into channel,"" recommending a tug to be sent to secure the wreck. It also shows the Pearl Harbor yard's essential work in repairing Navy warships after the Japanese attack, putting cruisers and destroyers back in the fight after severe damage. Within six months, the yard had taken in and redelivered the damaged battleships Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee; cruisers Honolulu, Helena, and Raleigh; destroyers Helm and Shaw; and three auxiliaries, all fully repaired or patched up for transit for permanent repairs.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Fincantieri Sues Citing $100M in Damages from Fraudulent Fire Insulation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fincantieri-sues-citing-100m-in-damages-from-fraudulent-fire-insulation,,18/08/2025 21:40:15,,"Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri is suing the manufacturer of fire insulation panels it used in the construction of three cruise ships and eight military ships, alleging fraud and misrepresentation that it says caused over $100 million in economic damages as well as reputational harm. The shipbuilder is alleging that Paroc Group, which is owned by Owens Corning, obtained safety certificates under “false pretenses by submitting altered materials for testing,” and conspired to maintain the fraud and sell a defective product which endangered safety. Paroc Group, which was acquired by Owens Corning in 2018, launched a new line of stonewool insulation products sold as fire safety panels for marine applications. The Navis line was promoted as a lighter-weight, fire-safe marine insulation for use in steel decks and bulkheads. Fincantieri reports that it and its subcontractors selected and began using the product in 2019 for both cruise ships and military vessels that required materials meeting the Class A-60 fire integrity standard. A-60 is the highest-rated fire insulation material under the SOLAS regs and is designed to prevent the transfer of heat for a minimum of 60 minutes. It is typically used for steel bulkheads, such as with galleys or casings, to provide protection from the potential to transfer heat and fire aboard a vessel. Fincantieri reports that it relied on the certification and the repeated assurances of the supplier for the integrity of the material. In 2023, a competitor of Owens Corning Paroc reported that it tested certain of the Navis products and found that they “did not in fact meet the fire integrity standards for Class A-60 products.” The competitor lodged a complaint, and independent testing by the Danish Institute of Fire and Security Technology in April 2023 confirmed the products were not compliant. They allege in the suit that it required a deliberate effort to undermine the initial testing process leading to the certification. They further state that the fraud required manipulation of testing materials and repeated and coordinated falsification. The product was recalled in May 2023, but Fincantieri writes in the lawsuit complaint that it “did not advise or instruct that any remedial actions be taken for completed vessels in service.” The Navis line was discontinued as of May 31, 2024. Fincantieri identified that it used the product on a total of 11 ships, including the already delivered Discovery Princess, which went into service for Carnival Corporation’s Princess Cruises in March 2022, as well as two luxury cruise ships, Explora I and Explora II, under construction for MSC’s Explora Journeys. The other eight vessels, including two under construction, are military vessels. Delivery of MSC’s Explora I was postponed for 21 days due to the need to replace the defective products. Fincantieri says it also delayed the delivery of Explora II in 2024 and Carnival Corporation’s Sun Princess being built for Princess Cruises. Fincantieri says that it is incurring over $100 million in harm. It says the direct costs include to investigate, repair, and remediate affected vessels, as well as increasing construction costs. It also incurred liquidated damages and other costs resulting from delayed deliveries. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio, where Owens Corning is headquartered. The corporation, a leader in building materials, was involved in more than 20 years of litigation related to the use of asbestos in shipbuilding materials before filing for bankruptcy and settling those suits in 2000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Maersk Reports Crew Stopped Spread of Container Fire on Vessel Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-reports-crew-stopped-spread-of-container-fire-on-vessel-off-africa,,18/08/2025 20:44:41,,"The container fire, which began last week on one of Maersk’s larger boxships, Marie Maersk, is believed to have stopped spreading, as firefighting efforts are expected to intensify. The 19,000 TEU vessel remains off the coast of Africa while the company is considering a port of refuge as the first step toward determining the full extent of the damage. “This was also achieved thanks to the assistance of four assets, three tugboats and a Platform Supply Vessel,” said Maersk in its update. The company said the vessels had brought firefighting equipment to the Marie Maersk over the past days, and AIS signals show they remain in proximity to the ship. “We expect firefighting efforts to intensify further once the external firefighters can board Marie Maersk.” The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the vessel early on August 13 while they were bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and China. Maersk has said the crew remains safe with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational. The Marie Maersk was diverted towards the West African coast to get landside support as fast as possible, and because of the large number of vessels diverting around Africa, additional Maersk vessels and others have also been in the vicinity. “Due to the prevailing conditions in the respective cargo bays, we still cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on the cargo yet,” Maersk stated. The goal is to get the vessel into a port of refuge where they can offload damaged containers and complete an inspection to determine the extent of the spread of the fire, smoke, and heat. The company has not said how many containers are aboard currently, but because they are outbound from Europe, it is possible the vessel is not fully loaded or is carrying empties. Maersk reports the vessel will be diverted to a port of refuge, which is under contemplation. The goal is to get landside support as fast as possible. The challenge is also finding a port that is willing to accept the vessel and has the capabilities to handle a container fire. In the case of the Maersk Frankfurt, which caught fire off India in July 2024, after the fire was brought under control, the vessel diverted to the Middle East. Another operator, X-Press Feeders, is again highlighting that ports in Qatar, India, and Sri Lanka refused permission when its vessel X-Press Pearl was desperately seeking refuge with a leaking container that ultimately caught fire and contributed to the total loss of the vessel.

Trump Administration Orders “Stop Work” on 80% Installed Offshore Wind Farm,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-orders-stop-work-on-80-complete-offshore-wind-farm,,24/08/2025 00:38:20,,"In a surprising move on Friday, August 22, the Trump administration took action against an 80 percent installed offshore wind farm being built by Denmark’s Ørsted and a subsidiary of BlackRock. The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a “halt to ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind project on the outer continental shelf (OCS) to allow time for it to address concerns that have arisen.” Unlike previous orders, which stopped projects before construction commenced, Revolution Wind has been under construction since 2024. Ørsted reports that the project is 80 percent complete, with all its offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. Steel in the water started in May 2024, and the first turbine installation was completed in September. The company says Revolution Wind is employing hundreds of local union workers both on and offshore and that approximately two million labor union hours have been spent on the project. The shore operations are at ProvPort and Quonset in Rhode Island, and State Pier in New London, Connecticut. BOEM was vague in its reasoning, writing in the letter to Ørsted North America that it is “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interest of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas and the territorial seas.” The letter signed by Acting Director of BOEM Matthew Giacona also refers to “concerns that have arisen” during its review under the President’s Memorandum of January 20 which directed agencies to review the industry. “Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” the company said in a statement confirming it was complying and taking steps to stop offshore activities. “This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution, as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.” In its statement, the company notes the project spent more than nine years in review and is fully permitted. It received approval of its Construction and Operations Plan in November 2023. Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles south of Rhode Island and 32 miles southeast of Connecticut, with power contracts with both states. The nearest point of land is Martha’s Vineyard with the project approximately 12 miles southwest. Power was expected to start by the spring of 2026, and when the project is completed, it would generate a total of 704 MW, with 400 MW going to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut. Ørsted points out that the project is using the same turbine technology as South Fork Wind, which was completed as the first large, commercial offshore wind farm in the United States in 2024. The stop work order pertains to all offshore activities on the OCS. The company can continue any emergency or safety work, as well as onshore activities. BOEM says the project may appeal this determination. Ørsted said in its statement that it is considering “a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.” The company is 50 percent owned by the Danish state, and just announced it was facing financial challenges due to the actions of the new U.S. government. It launched a rights offering to raise $9 billion from existing shareholders, which it is said is necessary to fund the construction work for another U.S. wind farm, Sunrise Wind, as well as completing Revolution Wind, after investors determined the risks are too great in the U.S. market based on the uncertainties raised by the Trump administration’s assault on wind energy. Last year, Eversource sold its 50 percent interest in its partnership with Ørsted to Global Infrastructure Partners and its Skyborn Renewables fund. GIS was acquired last year by BlackRock to expand the group's investment in renewable energy and infrastructure, with BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, reported to be a friend and supporter of Donald Trump. This is the second time the administration has issued a stop work order on an offshore wind farm. In April, the Department of the Interior suspended licenses to Equinor just as offshore work was due to begin on the Empire Wind project off New York. The suspension lasted for a month and drew broad criticism, while there were reports of pressure, including from the Norwegian government, which owns Equinor. There were reports of a deal where New York State will permit an oil pipeline it was blocking in exchange for the lifting of the stop work order on Empire Wind. Equinor reported it would take a $1 billion impairment charge related to the impact of the U.S. actions on the project and the offshore wind industry. Last week, the Trump administration also announced a further review of the manufacture of wind turbines and their components. Trump has repeatedly said they are made in China, although none of the U.S. projects are using Chinese turbines. The Commerce Department was ordered to start a trade investigation citing national security concerns over the importing of components for wind energy projects. Experts point out that 40 percent of the components for wind energy projects come from Europe, while Mexico is supplying more than 30 percent of the material used in the construction. The Trump administration has said it will include aluminum and steel components for wind turbines in the 50 percent tariff on imports, and the new trade investigation could impose further tariffs on components. The administration has already suspended future licensing and revoked previous approvals. Trump has promised to “stop the windmills.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Coast Guard Arrests Intoxicated MSC Containership Captain After Ship Docks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/coast-guard-arrests-intoxicated-msc-containership-captain-after-ship-docks,,23/08/2025 23:26:40,,"The US Coast Guard arrested the master of a containership this week after the pilot guiding the ship to port reported the captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Chicago Propeller Club Hears Industry Cry from MARAD Acting Administrator,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chicago-propeller-club-hears-industry-cry-from-marad-acting-administrator,,24/08/2025 00:47:04,,"[By: Chicago Propeller Club] The United States has entered a new era of maritime strength, the head of the Maritime Administration told the Chicago Propeller Club’s flagship summer event at Chicago Yacht Club. In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre. And she called on everyone present to combine their efforts and make the voice of the maritime industry stronger in Washington DC. “Working together our potential is so much greater and it will strengthen our voice in Washington,” she urged. Jackie Carter the Port of Milwaukee director was also honored on the evening as she moves to a new role with the City of Milwaukee. In a look to the future, Jack Dougherty, co-founder and owner of autonomous shipping company Janus Marine and Defense underscored the need for the maritime industry to embrace new technologies, stay ahead of the competition, increase operational efficiency and job safety, and boost national security. In addition, veteran led Chicago charity No Salt Sailing made an appeal for support. The charity helps veterans and their families cope with PTSD by learning to sail on the Great Lakes.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,23/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

Le Groupe ALMACO Secures Contract to Outfit Canada’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-secures-contract-to-outfit-canada-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 03:53:57,,"[By: Le Groupe ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed a $105M Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada's premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie's shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie's skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie's facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group's Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec's role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada's broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO's role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province's advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO's Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada's Maritime Future ""Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,"" said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. ""We've maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We're not just outfitting a ship—we're helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together."" ""Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. ""Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada."" Davie is a key player in Canada's National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. ""This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada's shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,"" said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. ""The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,"" said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. ""Davie's leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,"" said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. ""The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions' naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec's position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century."" A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
HD Hyundai Buys Manufacturer as it Seeks Expansion in Vietnam Shipbuilding,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-buys-manufacturer-as-it-seeks-expansion-in-vietnam-shipbuilding,,20/08/2025 23:45:30,,"South Korea’s HD Hyundai is continuing to pursue opportunities to grow its shipbuilding business and increase its competitive position against the Chinese. It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines. Footage shows Japanese Coast Guard ships battling a fire on the USS New Orleans (LPD-18) off Okinawa. pic.twitter.com/n0FBTtwjVo The fire appears to have begun in the forward part of the vessel around 4:00 p.m. local time on August 20. Spectators reported seeing smoke coming intermittently from the forward part of the vessel or midship. Video on Japanese TV showed tugs near the forward part of the ship spraying water on the hull. The fire was reported to the Japan Coast Guard, which sent a patrol boat to determine the extent of the situation. Around 5:00 p.m. local time, the Coast Guard reports it received a request for assistance from the U.S. Navy. However, that first call was withdrawn within the hour, and the U.S. Navy was instructing vessels to stay about one mile away. The request for assistance from the Japanese was reinstated around 7:30 p.m. local time. The Navy reports that the crew of a sister ship from the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock class, USS San Diego, which was moored at White Beach Naval Facility, assisted in fighting the fire. The Japan Self-Defense Force reported its vessels were conducting firefighting efforts to aid the crew of the USS New Orleans. The Japan Coast Guard was providing assistance. As the fire progressed, they employed a total of four tugs with two on each side of the warship to cool the full. The US 7th Fleet command thanked the Japanese for their aid. The reports emphasized that there have been no requests to evacuate any of the U.S. personnel from the vessel.

External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Russian Drones Damage Tanker During Attack on Oil Terminal in Izmail,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russian-drones-damage-tanker-during-attack-on-oil-terminal-in-izmail,,20/08/2025 18:50:13,,"Russia appears to have intensified its attacks on the Ukrainian fuel logistics infrastructure with a series of attacks, including targeting the largest terminal in southern Ukraine. The Triton Oil Depot came under fierce drone attacks overnight, inflicting heavy damage and catching a tanker during its offloading operations. The product tanker Excellion (7,842 dwt) had arrived from Sulina, Romania yesterday, August 19, reporting it was fully loaded, likely with diesel fuel. Built in 2008, the vessel is registered in Panama and listed as being operated by Makoil Group of the UK and managed from Estonia. According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa.

DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas.

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels. The Coast Guard (with help from the Navy) operates in the region to interdict drug traffickers, and it has historically conducted all law enforcement boardings. USNI noted that the Iwo Jima ARG's departure was the first deployment of any fully-equipped ARG in eight months. The Navy's amphib fleet readiness is deteriorating due to advancing age and persistent maintenance delays; it currently stands at about 40 percent, an official told Military Times this week - just half of the Marine Corps' desired level of Navy transport capability.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 21:27:46

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region.

The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41

The first phase will involve developing a green vessel recycling facility; the second component will include a shipbuilding center, providing ship construction and maintenance services; and lastly, the third phase includes building oil and gas storage facilities. “With the establishment of the shipyard complex, Pahang will emerge as a regional maritime hub, providing competitive services in shipbuilding, green ship recycling and oil and gas hub,” said Wan Rosdy, Head of Pahang State. The state is also implementing a similar project in the Gebeng industrial area, the Kuantan Maritime Hub (KMH), located about 35 miles to the north of Pekan. The $500 million project is being developed by Muhibbah Engineering and is scheduled for completion in 2034. The KMH project covers a 500-acre site, with some parts reclaimed from the sea. The hub is expected to host industries ranging from commercial shipbuilding and ship repair to defense and technical training. These flagship projects are important for Malaysia to retain a long-term standing in the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s CEO, Sikh Shamsul Ibrahim. “Malaysia should always remain vigilant of rising competition from lower cost yards in neighboring economies such a Vietnam and Indonesia. We should start focusing on reducing reliance on foreign automation tools, by approaching local robotic manufacturing in Malaysia, which could build a whole new automated system integration to improve productivity in our shipbuilding landscape,” added Sikh Shamsul. As of June, the authority said it has approved shipbuilding and ship repair sector investments worth over $230 million, showing sustained interest by the private sector to invest in the Malaysian shipyard sector.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03
"To Take On a Bigger Role, Malaysia's MMEA Buys a Bigger Ship",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/to-take-on-a-bigger-role-malaysia-s-mmea-buys-a-bigger-ship,,25/08/2025 04:53:12,,"This month, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) held a keel laying ceremony for a new Multi-Purpose Mission Ship (MPMS) in Turkey. The event marked another milestone in the construction of MMEA’s largest vessel, with the steel-cutting ceremony held last month. Construction is under way at Desan Shipyard after a memorandum of understanding with MMEA back in February. The signing of the construction contract followed in May, with the vessel scheduled for delivery in 2027. The construction project also involves cooperation with other Turkish defense industry companies such as Aselsan and Havelsan. The two companies will be involved in the installation of advanced weaponry, detection and communication systems. The 99-meter-long vessel will serve deep sea operations lasting 28 days without resupply. It will have capacity for 70 crew members and additional room for 30 passengers. For surveillance and interdiction, it will be equipped with two unmanned aerial vehicles, four fast interceptor craft, a helicopter deck and detention compartments. According to MMEA, the vessel will be deployed for surveillance in Malaysia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), especially in the South China Sea. In the past few years, Malaysia’s EEZ has become a hotspot for illegal Ship-to-Ship (STS) oil transfers. This has mainly involved older ships carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, raising concerns about compliance, safety and pollution. Recently, Malaysia has introduced new regulations with an aim to curb shadow fleet STS transfers. Some of the efforts include closing the notorious Tompok Utara anchorage and layup area near the Singapore Strait. However, MMEA emphasizes that it requires enhanced operational and patrolling capabilities to curb increased criminal activities in Malaysian waters. Last year, the agency got a budgetary allocation of $159 million to procure new vessels and maintain existing ones. Almost half of this allocation - $82 million - went into the acquisition of the MPMS. Another $37 million went into the procurement of two New Generation Patrol Craft (NGPC).",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03

Video: Chilean Navy Rescues Survivor From the Rocks in Tierra Del Fuego,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-chilean-navy-rescues-survivor-from-the-rocks-in-tierra-del-fuego,,25/08/2025 05:57:42,,"Against all odds, the Chilean Navy has rescued a survivor from a fishing vessel that went missing off Tierra del Fuego on Thursday. The four fishermen aboard the vessel were harvesting sea urchins, and the crew disappeared along with their vessel, the Ana Belen. Good Samaritan fishermen located the survivor - who was wearing a black wetsuit - in an area known locally as the Bahia Sea, near the western entrance to Beagle Channel. The maze of inlets at the westward fringe of Tierra del Fuego bears the full brunt of the region's stormy weather, and this creates real challenges for shore access. The survivor could not be reached by helicopter because of powerful downdrafts from the cliffs above, and heaving surf made it impossible to get a small boat near to the rocky shoreline. To complete the retrieval of the survivor, a Chilean Navy helicopter dropped a rescue swimmer into the water near the rocks, and he swam through the waves and climbed up on shore to reach the fisherman. Then, together, they got back into the frigid water and swam out to a pickup point. ""The extraction lasted approximately 25 minutes, which was vitally important since they had to swim to the rescue boat that was waiting for them in a safe place,"" said Serio Surriba, commander of the naval aviation unit in Puerto Williams. The survivor has been identified as Juan Andrés Rojas Casco, a Paraguayan national. The search for the three other missing fishermen continues, and the Chilean Navy has pledged to make ""every effort to find the rest of the crew.""

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region. As Turkey pushes to become a regional energy hub, the Mediterranean Sea presents significant potential in achieving the ambition. Recently, Turkey bought two drillships, which will boost its exploration capacity in the Mediterranean region.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

With the help of external firefighting teams and equipment brought out to the ship while it was off Africa, Maersk has reported that the fire was contained. The company released two pictures taken on Friday, August 22, when a supply vessel reached the scene with additional firefighting equipment. There is no visible fire damage to any of the boxes aboard what appears to be a heavily laden vessel. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU. “After an inspection of affected areas of the vessel and careful consideration of all aspects together with authorities and class, it was deemed safe that Marie Maersk resumes her eastbound voyage around Cape of Good Hope on Sunday. Her next port of destination is under final review, and we will inform as soon as it has been decided,” Maersk reported. Marie Maersk with no visible fire damage to the containers aboard (Maersk) The containership had spent a week lying off the west coast of Liberia after smoke was first detected coming from containers on August 13. The ship was moved closer to the coast so that fire equipment could be brought out. Late last week, the ship rounded the western coast of Africa and was then met with additional supplies offshore near Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire). A supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment reached the Marie Maersk on Friday evening and transferred special equipment onboard on Saturday, August 23. The AIS signal for the ship shows it now underway with a declared destination of Cape Town, South Africa. Its routing called for a stop in Malaysia before proceeding to China. The company has repeated said the navigational equipment and machinery was not damaged, and the ship was stable. Maersk reports that the external firefighting team will remain on board, and “special measures” have been put in place to ensure a safe journey. An intermediate stop might be implemented, Maersk said, depending on the optimal place for handling the damaged containers and to mitigate onward disruptions in its network. Contingencies are in place in case the planned journey needs to be revised en route. The company has not advised on the location of the boxes that were smoking or the nature of the cargo. In general, mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo is one of the most frequent dangers cited for the containership. Maersk has said the full extent of the damage would not be known until the vessel reaches a port and unloads containers from the area where the fire was located.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

The reports initially placed the drones at various points around the region, with Drozdenko reporting that at least 10 drones were destroyed on Saturday, prompting him to issue a warning for citizens to “refrain from being near industrial zones and enterprises, as well as visiting public places.” On Sunday, August 24, Drozdenko acknowledged that at least 10 drones had attacked the port of Ust-Luga, although he said they were all destroyed. Debris from a drone was, however, reported to have caused a fire at the Novatek terminal. The reports said there were no casualties. The extent of the damage is unclear, and many of the photos being posted online are from a 2024 fire at the plant. Drozdenko said the fire had been “localized” and that the fuel tanks were not damaged. By Sunday afternoon, the report was that the fire at Ust-Luga had been extinguished and Novatek was starting repairs and restoration work.

Some 600 miles from Ukraine. https://t.co/948Ma4zBEz pic.twitter.com/YTlQPjaETo It is believed the gas processing equipment was struck, taking the plant offline. Some reports are suggesting it could take months to repair, which would be a major blow to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Novatek has been operating the facility, which is located about 70 miles west of St. Petersburg, since 2013. Reports are that it handles more than seven million tons of gas condensate as well as more than four million tons of heavy and light oil. It is also a supplier of marine and jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel fuel. The daring attack was staged more than 600 miles from Ukraine and was part of a larger assault on the energy system. Russia’s defense ministry is saying 95 drones were launched across 14 regions and all were downed with minor damage. It acknowledged 13 drones destroyed over Ust-Luga, as well as some damage to a nuclear power plant. Russia has been striking Ukraine’s fuel import and distribution network and facilities. Last week, a tanker was reportedly damaged while unloading at the port of Izmail on the Danube.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

Two Canadian First Nations Buy Strategic Mining Port Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/two-canadian-first-nations-buy-strategic-mining-port-terminal,,26/08/2025 03:00:06,,"In a first-of-its-kind transaction for Canada’s British Columbia Province, two First Nations have formed a partnership with a Canadian logistics company and will acquire the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal located in northwestern British Columbia along the U.S.-Canada border. It comes as there is an increasing push to tap Canada’s minerals and resources for economic advancement. ""This isn't just about us purchasing the first Indigenous majority-owned port in British Columbia's history,"" Andrew Robinson, chief executive officer of the Nisga'a Lisims Government, told The Canadian Press. “It's about economic sovereignty, reconciliation, and ensuring that wealth generated from our lands directly benefits our people and generations to come.” The Nisga’a Nation and the Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership are partnering with Arrow Transportation Systems to launch the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. The new group is also consolidating the regional trucking operations of Arrow Transport’s Stewart Trucking Division and Tahltan-Arrow Transport to provide bulk transportation and logistics solutions in the Tahltan Territory. They note that Northwest BC is home to more than half the province’s exploration and mining sector. They believe the new partnership will provide improved access to deliver critical minerals from mine to market. The Port of Stewart is Canada’s most northerly ice-free port located to the north of Prince Rupert and supplying critical access to both British Columbia and Alberta. It is 80 to 90 miles from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the Portland Canal and provides support for the logging, mining, and exploration operations in the region. “Together, we are making history,” said Kerry Carlick, President, Tahltan Central Government. “The acquisition of this strategic asset will drive economic growth, create opportunities, and strengthen our nations’ self-determination.” The terminal primarily handles ore and logging with a breakbulk wharf and RoRo capabilities for barges. It can accommodate vessels up to approximately 50,000 dwt for the transport of ore and logs. One of the key customers is Newmont, which operates the Brucejacket and Red Chris mines in the indigenous communities’ territories and transports copper concentrate to market from the port. Newmont is strengthening its ties with the First Nations to support long-term growth of the port as a regional hub and provide the port’s new owners commercial certainty needed to move forward with the investments. The Province of British Columbia has also provided a C$5 million (US$3.6 million) grant to the two First Nations to support the purchase of the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. It is part of the government’s Northwest Strategy to support mining development and the indigenous peoples.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Master Boat Builders Expands Shipbuilding Operations,https://maritime-executive.com/article/master-boat-builders-expands-shipbuilding-operations,,26/08/2025 02:08:19,,"[By Master Boat Builders] Master Boat Builders, Inc. (Master Boat), an internationally recognized vessel and workboat manufacturer, today announced that it has invested $7.8 million to modernize and expand its shipbuilding operations in Mobile County by adding a new fabrication shop and floating drydock. The expansion project creates 85 new jobs, adding to Master Boat’s skilled workforce of more than 300 workers and further contributes to Mobile County’s strength in shipbuilding and maritime services. “This investment is about more than just expanding our ability to build more high-quality vessels. It underscores our commitment to increasing American shipbuilding capacity and we’re doing it right here along America’s Gulf Coast in Mobile County,” said Garrett Rice, President of Master Boat Builders. “By modernizing our facilities and growing our skilled workforce, we’re positioning our team to deliver critical vessels that support U.S. commerce and industry, all while training the next generation of American shipbuilders.” “Mobile’s maritime industry continues to thrive, and Master Boat’s investment underscores our region’s leadership in shipbuilding,” said Bradley Byrne, Mobile Chamber president and CEO. “By creating new jobs, retaining existing ones and investing in workforce development, this project is a powerful example of how our business community is growing alongside our thriving port and maritime economy.” The expansion includes the construction of a new fabrication building, a floating dry dock to support new harbor tug contracts, workforce training initiatives and infrastructure improvements. “Master Boat Builders is a 45-year-old, third generation, locally owned shipbuilder located in the Bayou. They have employed thousands of people over that span from local communities and currently employ over 300 people. If we can’t incentivize and support the growth of a business like Master, we shouldn’t be incentivizing anyone!” said District 3 Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt. “This expansion not only secures and creates jobs for local families, but it also reinforces the fact that Mobile County is a leader in shipbuilding and maritime innovation and will be for years to come.” This project also supports the region’s ongoing workforce development and training initiatives, reflecting the growing demand for skilled talent within the maritime and shipbuilding sectors. “Master Boat’s expansion highlights the continued momentum of Alabama’s maritime industry and reinforces Mobile County’s position as a hub for shipbuilding and repair,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “This investment not only creates quality jobs but also strengthens the region’s capacity to support a vital sector of our state’s economy.” Work on this expansion began October of 2024 and is expected to be fully operational by October of this year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Mediterranean NGO Reports Libya Shot and Damaged its Rescue Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mediterranean-ngo-reports-libya-shot-and-damaged-its-rescue-boat,,26/08/2025 01:59:48,,"The NGO SOS Mediterranee released details on an encounter in the Mediterranean on Sunday, August 24, in which it says the Libyan Coast Guard opened fire on its ship and continued to attack the ship for up to 20 minutes. The group released pictures showing shattered bridge windows among other damage, which it reports the Libyans inflicted on the small rescue boat Ocean Viking. SOS Mediterranee has been operating the Ocean Viking, a former North Sea supply vessel for the oil and gas industry, since 2019 under charter from the International Red Cross. Built in 1986 and now registered in Norway, the ship was outfitted with three rigid rescue boats and a medical facility. The group reports it made two rescues on August 23, taking aboard 47 people, including nine unaccompanied minors, who it says are mostly from war-torn Somalia. The Italians had ordered the Ocean Viking to head to Marina di Carrara, a 700 nautical mile trip that would have required 3.5 days, but they received permission to remain in the Mediterranean searching for a third boat with migrants. The Ocean Viking, they report, was 40 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast when they were confronted by a patrol boat on Sunday afternoon. According to their account of the situation, the Libyans first demanded that the vessel leave the area and head north immediately. They said the instructions were radioed in English and Arabic. Today at 3pm, the #OceanViking has been deliberately and violently attacked in intl. waters by the Libyan Coast Guard, who fired hundreds of shots at our ship. The 87 survivors and crew on board were not wounded. We are currently working on a detailed reconstruction of events. pic.twitter.com/i8RkuYI1ep Without warning or an ultimatum, SOS Mediterranee reports that two soldiers aboard the Libyan boat began shooting at the Ocean Viking. They are claiming the patrol boat circled the vessel, shooting for up to 20 minutes. Four windows on the bridge were broken, multiple antennas were destroyed, and several bullets struck and damaged the three fast rescue boats, along with other equipment. None of the migrants or crew were injured. The Ocean Viking issued a mayday and called NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian. They report that they were told an Italian navy ship was the closest NATO asset, but it did not return calls. The captain of the Ocean Viking started his vessel for Syracuse, Italy, but the authorities later ordered them to sail to Augusta. SOS Mediterranee is demanding a full investigation into the incident. It is also pointing out that the vessel that attacked them was one of two patrol boats Italy gifted to Libya in June 2023. There have been similar incidents in the past with the Libyan Coast Guard and the rescue vessels. This one, however, was more aggressive and longer. The group says its volunteers and the survivors were clearly threatened and felt in serious danger.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
U.S. Coast Guard Sets Record With 34-Tonne Cocaine Offload,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-sets-record-with-34-tonne-cocaine-offload,,26/08/2025 01:48:45,,"The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Hamilton has offloaded a record-setting 34 tonnes of cocaine at the pier in Port Everglades, a quantity of the drug rarely seen in one place. It is the service's largest single cocaine offload on record, and the Coast Guard estimated its value at a (much-reduced) price of just $470 million. An overabundance of South American cocaine exports have pushed down prices in export markets, increasing volume and reducing its value at the same time. USCGC Hamilton offloaded cocaine collected in 19 separate interdictions near Aruba, Haiti, Venezuela, Curacao, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Bonaire, and a variety of high-seas locations in the Eastern Pacific, from Ecuador to Mexico. Six different Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy vessels participated in the seizures, but Hamilton played the largest role, conducting 11 interdictions and seizing a record 47,000 pounds of cocaine. Cocaine bust off Bonaire, facilitated by destroyer USS Cole (USCG) “Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,” said Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer of Hamilton. “The commitment and sacrifice of our deployed service members and their families, who forego time together for the protection of our Nation, are to be celebrated.” A large share of the cocaine traffic through the Caribbean is destined for Europe, not the United States. European customers account for about one fifth of global cocaine demand, and have historically paid a premium for the drug. The Coast Guard priced out the shipment's U.S. wholesale value at about $14,000 per kilo, a fraction of the 2024 EU average of about $35,000 per kilo; EU street and wholesale prices have fallen since the first quarter of 2025, according to multiple European media reports, driven down by an abundant supply and a price war between cartels.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Zim Confirms Turkey’s Immediate Ban on Shipping Associated with Israel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/zim-confirms-turkey-s-immediate-ban-on-shipping-associated-with-israel,,26/08/2025 00:58:53,,"Zim confirmed the earlier reports that Turkey has begun turning away ships associated with Israel. The company, which is the ninth-largest container carrier, reports it is rerouting ships scheduled to call at Turkish ports and working on a mitigation plan. In a stock exchange filing on Monday, August 25, Zim writes, “It received a notice from the Turkish Port Authorities through the company’s local agent in Turkey, that as a result of a new regulation adopted in Turkey, vessels that are either owned, managed or operated by an entity related to Israel will not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports.” The change was said to be effective immediately as of last Friday. The Globes newspaper in Israel reports that one of the company’s ships was turned away from Istanbul last Friday. It writes that the vessel was forced to proceed to Piraeus, Greece, and that there is no clear solution for the cargo scheduled to be loaded or unloaded in Istanbul. The new regulation also impacts all vessels that are carrying military cargo destined to Israel, which Zim says it was told would not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports. Also, Turkish-flagged vessels are prohibited from calling at Israeli ports. Globes reports that while it is an expansion of the trade embargo Turkey imposed 15 months ago, it says shipping companies are still waiting for clear instructions from the Turkish government. It says other major carriers, such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, are seeking clear instructions. A ship’s flag is said not to be a guarantee that it will be permitted into a Turkish port. It is not the first country to bar Israeli shipping, for example, Malaysia took a similar step in December 2023, but it is a minor trading partner with Israel. Turkey and Israel had a large trade flow, and even after the embargo, trade continued between the countries. The ban comes as Zim has already been under pressure. Last week, the company reported a 15 percent decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2025 and a 38 percent decline in earnings (EBITDA) for the quarter. Carried container volume was down six percent in the second quarter to 895,000 TEU, but box volume for the six months was up year-over-year to 1.84 million TEU. Management cited the company’s agility and ability to respond to the challenging market conditions. Based on its outlook, it raised its midpoint guidance for the full year 2025 despite the softness in the quarter. Today, it however, warned that if Turkey’s ban remains unchanged, it is expected to negatively impact financial and operating results. Recently, there have been market rumors that management was exploring a possible buyout of Zim with an investment group. Zim went public in January 2021 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
NTSB: Barge Grounded in Prince William Sound After ATB's Lines Parted,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-barge-grounded-in-prince-william-sound-because-atb-s-lines-parted,,26/08/2025 00:41:25,,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the results of its investigation into the loss of the barge Cordova Provider, which ran aground in Prince William Sound and suffered so much damage that it was declared a total loss. Cordova Provider began life as an ice-class oil recovery barge, but in 2005 it was modified with a notch to serve as one half of a unique ATB. The other half, the tug Krystal Sea, was built at the Western Towboat yard at the same time. Instead of coupler pins like those found on an Articouple or Intercon system, the Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider fit together with a wedge-and-recess system that had no moving parts. Three wedges on the tug - one on the bow, one to port and one to starboard - would line up with corresponding recesses within the notch at the stern of the barge. Changes in relative draft could be compensated for by backing out of the notch and re-entering at a different set of recesses. Instead of a positive mechanical connection, the Krystal Sea was held in the slot by four breast lines (push lines) running from the barge to winches on the stern of the towboat, much like an inland towboat. When Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider were built, the lines and bridles were steel wire rope; the operator later exchanged the wire rope for Dyneema soft lines, which were lighter and safer for the crew to handle over the side. Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider operated in this configuration to move breakbulk cargo around Prince William Sound, within sheltered waters. On the morning of January 10, 2025, the ATB got under way from Valdez, headed across the sound for Cordova. The forecast called for winds of 45 knots, consistent with wintertime weather along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Six-foot seas were expected in the sound, rising to 10 feet after midnight. The ATB's call in Cordova was completed swiftly, and the ATB departed for Whittier at 2110. By 0200 hours the next morning, as Krystal Sea crossed the middle of the sound, seas rose to 4-6 feet, with wind and waves on the port quarter of the tug - typical conditions, according to the crew. At 0250, the mate on watch heard a line snap, followed by three more. All four of the Dyneema lines that held the tug and barge together had parted in the middle, and the Cordova Provider was adrift. The master came to the bridge and maneuvered to see if there was a way to regain control of the barge, but the surface conditions made this too dangerous to attempt. Instead, the Coast Guard put the master in contact with the operator of the escort tug Latouche, moored nearby. The Latouche arrived on scene at 0550 hours and attempted to retrieve the barge by getting a line onto a bitt on its stern. The crew succeeded, but the line parted shortly after. Latouche was forced to give up the chase as Cordova Provider drifted into dangerous shallows off Axel Lind Island. The barge then ran aground, sustained extensive hull damage on the rocks, and partially sank. It was later refloated, towed offshore and disposed of through sinking in deeper water. Investigators' focus turned to the lines that connected the two vessels as an ATB unit. The operator had switched to soft shackles and Dyneema pennant lines in 2023-4, and the captain had inspected the rigging about five days before the casualty, finding nothing amiss. After the casualty, a technician from the firm that assembled the lines determined that they were in fair to good condition, with minor abrasion. Three had parted in the middle of the pennant section, and one parted at the soft shackle. All components were rated for a 100,000-pound breaking strength. NTSB concluded that the lines likely parted due to shock loading, with cascading failure after the first line parted. As the tug had served in similar conditions before, the reason for the break on this particular trip is unknown.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Northern Lights Injects First CO2 in Subsea Storage Well,https://maritime-executive.com/article/northern-lights-injects-first-co2-in-subsea-storage-well,,25/08/2025 23:51:55,,"The pioneering Northern Lights project has injected its first shipment of carbon dioxide for long-term storage in a subsea reservoir off the coast of Norway, launching a long-anticipated service backed by Equinor (as operator), TotalEnergies, Shell and the Norwegian government. “With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” said the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, in a statement Monday. Northern Lights is the first commercial-scale project of its kind, and it is the backbone of a constellation of Norwegian carbon-capture initiatives. The offshore reservoir serves as the final destination for carbon from a variety of onshore industries, notably the Heidelberg cement plant in the town of Brevik and the Hafslund waste incineration plant in Oslo. Other future users include Yara, Stockholm Exergi and Orsted, among others, through the provision of long-distance CO2 shipping. An initial small-scale liquefied CO2 shipping service is provided by K Line. Now that Northern Lights is up and running, its backers want to expand it rapidly. The current capacity is just 1.5 million tonnes per year, about the same as the annual emissions of 320,000 non-electric cars. With backing from the EU, its owners plan to add more infrastructure to more than triple that number to 5.0 million tonnes per year. This second development phase should be completed and ready for operation in late 2028. The scope includes an additional jetty, nine new storage tanks, and more injection wells. Over the long term, Equinor wants to have 30-50 million tonnes a year of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035, primarily in Europe and in the U.S.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Italian Coast Guard Responds as Mega MSC Cruise Ship Loses Propulsion Power,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-responds-as-mega-msc-cruise-ship-loses-propulsion-power,,25/08/2025 23:20:27,,"MSC World Europa, one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a reported 8,500 people aboard, lost propulsion early Monday, August 25, off the coast of Italy. The incident drew wide media attention with sensational reports saying it had grounded or crashed. The Guardia Costiera responded to the ship, and it was emphasized that the vessel was never in any physical danger. Introduced in 2022 as the first cruise ship to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, the ship was making a week-long cruise circuit in the Western Mediterranean and sailing between Genoa and Naples when, according to passengers, the vessel stopped at approximately 0530 Monday morning. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard control center at approximately 0730, and two patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched to survey the situation. At 215,863 gross tons, the massive 1,094-foot (333-meter) vessel is reported to have a total of 8,585 people aboard, including 6,496 passengers on an end of summer cruise and 2,089 crewmembers. Some of the passengers were due to disembark today in Naples, and others were waiting to join the ship. The Coast Guard placed officers aboard the ship to survey the situation and reported it was told that the ship was experiencing an electrical problem with its propulsion. The ship is one of the largest to be fueled with LNG and uses Azipods for propulsion. It was built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and is second in size only to Royal Caribbean International’s sister ships Icon and Star of the Seas. MSC introduced a second ship of the class this year and has ordered four more World Class ships. Passengers were reported calm while the ship was drifting approximately eight miles off the coast of the Italian island of Ponza. The ship was able to continue to run its generators and was maintaining passenger services. Two tugs from the ports of Gioia Tauro and Naples were dispatched, and plans were being made to tow the ship, if necessary, the approximately 50 miles to Naples. However, by early afternoon, MSC Cruises was reporting that the crew had been able to initially restore partial propulsion. The Coast Guard did a further inspection, and the ship was moving at 15 knots with a Coast Guard escort to Naples. It docked at 2100 local time on Monday night. MSC said technicians would continue to repair and inspect the cruise ship. Passengers were proceeding with the disembarkation and embarkation. The plan called for the ship to resume its cruise on Tuesday, sailing for Messina.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
"Finnish Prosecutors Demand Jail Time for Captain, Officers of Shadow Tanker",https://maritime-executive.com/article/finnish-prosecutors-demand-jail-time-for-captain-officers-of-shadow-tanker,,25/08/2025 22:31:48,,"The trial for the captain and two senior officers of the shadow fleet tanker Eagle S began on Monday, August 25, in the Helsinki District Court. They are facing charges ranging from aggravated sabotage and aggravated telecommunications interference to lesser charges of vandalism and endangering public safety. The trial stems from the December 25, 2024, damage by the 74,000 dwt tanker Eagle S to the undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia, as well as four telecommunications cables. Prosecutors told the court that the laden tanker, which was registered in the Cook Islands, dragged its anchor for a distance of at least 55 miles in the Baltic. For the first time, they also said in court that the vessel appeared to slow as it passed over the cables, and they contended that if the Finnish authorities had not intervened and seized the tanker, it would have done more damage as it continued its trip. The prosecution is reported to be demanding jail time for the master of the vessel, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, a Georgia national, Robert Egizaryan, another Georgian who was the first officer, and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, an Indian who was the second officer on the vessel. The Finnish news outlet Yle reports the prosecution called for sentences of two and a half years in prison, which is near the minimum of two years under the law. The maximum for aggravated sabotage (criminal mischief) is 10 years in prison, while the aggravated charges for interfering with telecommunications are up to five years. They are saying the charges are “aggravated” because their actions were intentional and deliberate. Prosecutors assert the crew was required to operate the vessel safely. The three individuals are pleading not guilty to the charges. The captain speaking to the Swedish Yle last week said it was a “maritime accident.” Defense lawyers reiterated the claim that it was an accident. The captain claimed to Yle that no alarms sounded and that they did not sense changes in the ship. In court, it was revealed that the ship stopped at midday due to an engine problem and was experiencing heavy weather in the Baltic. They have not said when the anchor was deployed, but they are saying a broken safety pin could have caused it to come loose. The court was also told that the braking system for the anchor was heavily rusted and inoperable. The Vessel Traffic Service had made an inquiry to the ship during the afternoon, at which time they said the second officer denied that the anchor was down. It was not until 1845 that they were told they were dragging something on the seafloor and instructed to raise the anchor. The officers claimed that a check of the mooring deck at dinner time that night was not safe because of the weather. The court will also have to take up the question of jurisdiction. The UAE-based shipping company that managed the Eagle S contends Finland lacks authority because the damage happened in international waters and points out that Finland was not endangered because it sends power to Estonia. During the hearing today, the court was told a manager from the shipping company had instructed the captain to delete a report showing the vessel had crossed over the damaged cables. The prosecution is also asking the court to consider compensation for the damage and repairs. The Finnish and Estonian companies have said it cost them more than $70 million to repair the cables, which were out of service for months. Finland conducted a Port State inspection on the Eagle S at the beginning of January and reported 53 deficiencies ranging from fire safety to structural conditions and violations of the Master Labor Contract for seafarers. They reported that radar and firefighting equipment were inoperable and problems in the cargo pump room. The vessel was detained in Finland for 53 days before it was permitted to sail. The incident raised awareness of the dangers to the subsea infrastructure and the issues with the shadow fleet. Baltic and Scandinavian countries increased their monitoring of the shadow fleet and began challenging the vessels on documentation, including insurance coverage. The countries were also successful in getting NATO to deploy additional resources to the Baltic and North Sea. Russia has responded, denying knowledge of the vessels’ actions, and calling the Western efforts piracy, vowing to defend the shadow fleet tankers.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Egypt and Greece Reject Turkish-Libyan EEZ Claim,https://maritime-executive.com/article/egypt-and-greece-reject-turkish-libyan-eez-claim,,25/08/2025 22:31:21,,"Egypt and Greece have rejected a bilateral accord first tabled in 2019, which seeks to establish a maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya in the Mediterranean. The accord appears likely to be signed up to by the government in eastern Libya, having been agreed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government in western Libya six years ago. The purpose of the accord is to facilitate oil exploration, by establishing a boundary within the sea corridor claimed by Libya and Turkey. When the accord was originally tabled in 2019, it was met with almost universal rejection. It was regarded as a breach of the International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), by the United States, the EU, Russia and the Arab League amongst many, but in particular by Greece, Egypt and Cyprus because the Libyan-Turkish corridor was superimposed over their own UNCLOS-backed claims for 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones. The Turkish-Libyan accord is likely to be hotly contested, and it is not clear what lies behind the revived claim. It is possible that some of those who were originally vehemently opposed to the carve-up have now switched sides, conjecturing that under the Trump administration, potential economic gains could outweigh previous political understandings and the potential breaches of UNCLOS - and also believing that the revival of the Libyan-Turkish claim could become part of a settlement of Libya’s long-running political crisis. Turkey is already in dispute with Greece and Cyprus over exploitation of oil and gas reserves to the south of Cyprus, among many other issues. Greece and Turkey (and Turkey's Ottoman predecessors) have spent centuries contesting territorial control over the region, most recently including the partition of Cyprus in 1974 and the ongoing dispute over islands and maritime zones in the Aegean.

"Trump: ""We're Going to be Buying Ships From South Korea""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-we-re-going-to-be-buying-ships-from-south-korea,,26/08/2025 06:50:56,,"Shipbuilding was at the top of the agenda in talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, and the outcomes included a pledge from Trump to buy ships from Korea. In hopes of securing lower U.S. tariff rates and keeping the multibillion-dollar Korean auto industry competitive on the U.S. market, Seoul pledged an investment of $150 billion in America's shipbuilding sector. The bid was successful: Korea won a 10-point reduction in its tariff rate, putting its manufacturers on the same footing as competitors in Japan and the EU. To get the Trump administration to seal the deal, Korean trade officials came up with a slogan - ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. This gesture won the attention of the administration's trade negotiators, yielding a more favorable 15 percent tariff on Korean cars, computer chips and other exports. Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung was the first major bilateral press conference after the deal was concluded, and it appeared to yield a result that fulfills the hopes of Korean yards as well: an American intention to buy Korean hulls. ""We're going to be buying ships from South Korea,"" Trump said. ""We love their ships."" Trump told reporters that in the long term, ""we're also going to have them make ships here with our people, using our people, and we're going to go back into the shipbuilding business again."" As for timing, Trump emphasized that ""it takes a while"" and that ""shipbuilding is a tough one to start."" In addition to favoring Korean ships, Trump has also spoken highly of Finnish shipbuilding. Earlier this year, he told reporters that he has negotiated personally with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on the terms for purchasing used and new icebreakers from a non-U.S. shipyard. Two Finland-based yards, Helsinki Shipyard and Rauma, are said to be bidding for a program to build medium icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard (in cooperation with local partners in the United States). Korean state investment with U.S. guidance Coinciding with the Trump-Lee meeting on Monday, the U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management announced a partnership with Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai to launch a new ""maritime investment strategy"" focused on American shipbuilding opportunities. The new strategy, Cerberus Maritime, will also look for investment possibilities in the American maritime industry writ large, including maritime logistics, supply chains, infrastructure, ports and technology. HD Hyundai will provide shipbuilding expertise and serve as an anchor investor in the partnership. In addition, it will bring with it the Korean government's state sponsor for shipping and shipbuilding, Korea Development Bank (KDB). The policy bank is known as a lender of last resort for Korean shipyards; it was the largest shareholder in DSME before it arranged the yard's sale to Hanwha in 2022. In its investment role with HD Hyundai and Cerberus, KDB will ""facilitate investments into the Cerberus Maritime strategy"" in recognition of the initiative's importance to Korean national objectives. Cerberus and HD Hyundai have worked together in shipbuilding before. In 2022, Cerberus bought the former Hanjin-owned shipyard in Subic Bay, the biggest yard in the Philippines. Cerberus has leased out part of the space to HD Hyundai, which is investing $550 million at the site and plans to begin building product tankers there by early next year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44
Whale Atlas: An Easy-to-Use Mapping Tool for Whale-Safer Global Navigation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/whale-atlas-an-easy-to-use-mapping-tool-for-whale-safer-global-navigation,,26/08/2025 04:48:00,,"2025 has been a tumultuous year for large whales in California and beyond. At least eight gray whales have been killed by ship strikes just in the Bay Area. While the majority of ship strikes go unobserved and undetected, researchers estimate that 80 endangered whales are fatally struck each year off the West Coast of the U.S. This reality was the impetus behind creating a new online portal which offers digitized details of whale conservation zones to make it easier for mariners planning multinational transits to understand and cooperate with whale-protection measures. In many places throughout the world, high-traffic shipping zones overlap with whale foraging areas and migration routes. Marine managers aim to reduce the risk of strikes by slowing ships down or asking them to avoid certain areas at certain times of the year. For the past ten years, Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies (BWBS) has engaged shipping companies, asking them to reduce their speeds voluntarily to a whale-safer level of 10 knots or less off the coast of California during peak whale migratory season. Programs like BWBS, which verifies cooperation with NOAA’s voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) requests, work collaboratively with industry, and have been proven to be effective - reducing fatal strike risk by 50%. Where and when vessels reduce speeds is just as important as the slowing down itself. Resource managers use the best available science to determine the placement and timing of VSR zones. Video credit: Katherine Brook; vessel and whale footage by Adam Ernster Advancing global awareness and collaboration around whale protection measures Whale conservation programs and protection measures centered on reducing shipping impacts on whales exist around the world, including in the Strait of Gibraltar; Hellenic Trench; Bering and Salish Seas; Costa Rica; Gulfs of Panama, Hauraki and Saint Lawrence; and the Canadian Arctic. In 2023 and 2024 the World Shipping Council released a first-of-its-kind Whale Chart Report that compiled and outlined whale protection measures across the globe in order to raise awareness to mariners of opportunities to reduce biodiversity impacts. This included VSR zones, Areas to be Avoided (ATBAs), and Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), all aimed at directing vessel traffic to either reduce speeds within or stay away from critical whale habitat areas. Seeing an opportunity to make this valuable information more interactive and user-friendly, California Marine Sanctuary Foundation (CMSF) and the BWBS team developed an online platform to enhance how mariners access and engage with the information critical to understanding and cooperating with whale protection measures. CMSF is proud to introduce “Whale Atlas: A Mariners Guide to Whale-Safer Shipping” This new, online portal showcases digitized whale conservation zones and protection measures relevant to maritime shipping activities. It houses information on: Whale Atlas with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary selected, part of the NOAA voluntary VSR request, and Blue Whales Blue Skies program in California Whale conservation zones represent areas where mariners are requested to either: reduce speeds or avoid important habitats for a few months or year-round. Whale Atlas provides this information, as well as the source/administering agency, so mariners can zoom in and out of relevant geographies, learn about opportunities to operate more sustainably, download layers in relevant formats, and incorporate measures into their transit plans. CMSF and the BWBS team will regularly update the data to ensure that the conservation zones are current as guidance, data, and priority zones evolve. Maritime shipping is a global industry, and Whale Atlas brings us one step closer to ensuring that mariners consider whale-friendly shipping practices on the same global scale. Whale Atlas is now live and can be found on the new Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies website at https://bluewhalesblueskies.org/resources/.

Career Submariner Takes Helm as Navy's New Top Officer,https://maritime-executive.com/article/career-submariner-takes-helm-as-navy-s-new-top-officer,,26/08/2025 04:13:21,,"Adm. Daryl Caudle has been sworn in as the Navy's newly-confirmed Chief of Naval Operations, taking over from Vice CNO Adm. Jim Kilby, who has been in the top post in an acting capacity since the dismissal of Adm. Lisa Franchetti in February. Caudle is a chemical engineer by training, and he commissioned into the Navy after graduating from North Carolina State; he holds a masters in physics and another in engineering management, plus a doctorate in organizational leadership. He has run Fleet Forces Command, the Navy's training and sustainment arm, since 2021; before that, he was a career submarine officer, culminating in an appointment as Commander, Submarine Forces - the Navy's top undersea domain officer. ""The sailor will be front and center in my vision throughout my tenure as CNO — hands down, no exception,"" Caudle said at his change of command ceremony. ""To ensure that they are ready to fight and win decisively — today, tomorrow and well into the future — we will view everything we do we through an operational lens focused on three priorities: the foundry, the fleet and the way we fight."" The new CNO also emphasized that the Navy must transform itself with AI, robotics, autonomous systems, hypersonics and other advanced technologies in order to maintain deterrence. ""The way we fight today will not be the way we fight tomorrow,"" Caudle said. Caudle has a reputation as a persistent solver of technical and organizational problems. He was selected at a time of pressing need: all of the Navy's new construction programs are behind schedule, and existing surface combatants, subs, amphibs and carriers face delays at repair yards, reducing availability. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan made clear that Caudle's troubleshooting skills were valued. ""Admiral Caudle, 'the honey badger,' is the right man for the job,"" Phelan said. ""He has a reputation for challenging the status quo, demanding results and refusing to accept excuses. I look forward to seeing that relentlessness pursuit of excellence and persistence pervade the halls of the Pentagon."" Caudle takes the helm at a time of rapid change for the Navy, both in personnel and in structure. Last week, Navy Reserve chief Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Navy Special Warfare commander Rear Adm. Jamie Sands were both dismissed from their posts. The Navy has not provided a reason for the dismissals; both leaders had been promoted to their positions in August 2024. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to pull responsibility for sub procurement out of the Navy's command structure and put it directly under the deputy secretary of defense, according to USNI. A new three-star ""submarine czar"" in the Pentagon will have budget control over sub maintenance, oversee the multibillion-dollar industry-boosting program for the sub supply chain, and work with the Navy to set requirements for new submarines - all functions that previously existed within Naval Sea Systems Command.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44
