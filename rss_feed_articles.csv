"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Iain Macneil MNM and Kat Heathcote Macneil MBE return to their roots with the announcement of a new CBT Joint Venture initially focussing on the burgeoning Maritime Security Sector. Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Great Lakes Announces the Delivery of its Newest Hopper Dredge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/great-lakes-announces-the-delivery-of-its-newest-hopper-dredge,,22/08/2025 18:43:30,,"[By Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp.] Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation (""Great Lakes"" or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GLDD), the largest provider of dredging services in the United States, today announced it took delivery of its newest Jones Act-compliant hopper dredge, the Amelia Island from the Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, Louisiana.

MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Mano Cruises Crown Iris was forced to skip ports and has also reported delays as protestors vented their anger over the war during the ship’s port visits.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
China Coast Guard Up-Guns its Presence at Scarborough Shoal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-coast-guard-up-guns-its-presence-at-scarborough-shoal,,22/08/2025 01:09:58,,"The China Coast Guard has up-gunned its patrol forces at Scarborough Shoal after a series of high-profile security developments at the reef, including an embarrassing collision between a Chinese PLA Navy warship and a China Coast Guard cutter earlier this month. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Hurricane Erin Creates Risk for Shipping off U.S. East Coast,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hurricane-erin-creates-risk-for-shipping-off-u-s-east-coast,,21/08/2025 03:50:54,,"The outer bands of Hurricane Erin have reached the coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic states, bringing risks to shipping and to the general public in beachfront communities. Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines.

In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre.

We look forward to sharing our vision and meeting with global maritime and logistics leaders during this innovative conference and exhibition” he added. Bahri's commitment to excellence is evidenced by its recent significant investments in fleet expansion. In August 2024, the company secured a landmark $1 billion deal to acquire nine Very Large Crude-oil Carriers (VLCCs) from Capital Marine and Trading Cooperation, reinforcing its position as one of the largest VLCC operators worldwide. This acquisition was part of a broader fleet modernization initiative that sees Bahri operate an impressive fleet of 103 owned vessels, and three floating desalination barges. Bahri's strategic vision extends beyond fleet expansion to include the development of a comprehensive maritime ecosystem within Saudi Arabia. The company has formed strategic partnerships with key national entities to strengthen the Kingdom's maritime capabilities including: a strategic Letter of Intent with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma'aden) to explore collaboration opportunities for localizing maritime industries and developing resilient supply chains; partnership with the Saudi Logistics Academy to enhance employment opportunities and skills development in the maritime logistics sector, and expansion of Bahri Ship Management's service portfolio to provide technical ship management and crewing services to other maritime operators. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey toward becoming a global maritime cluster under Vision 2030, Bahri stands at the helm, navigating the Kingdom toward a prosperous and sustainable maritime future on the world stage. This year’s Saudi Maritime Logistics Congress is organised by Seatrade Maritime, part of Informa Markets and with Founding Strategic Partner, Bahri, alongside Main Partners, Mawani, and TGA. According to Chris Morley, Group Director, Seatrade Maritime, “The maritime industry represents a crucial component of Saudi Arabia's ""blue economy"" strategy, which recognizes the potential for significant returns on maritime investments as part of the broader economic transformation agenda. Our objective is to showcase the phenomenal opportunities available through collaborations with both national and international companies, as well as deep dive into the multiple ongoing projects. The conference agenda will spotlight investment, innovation and sustainability amongst other key topics and bring together over 100 regional and international experts.” “Our ultimate aim is to facilitate fruitful cooperation between the public and private sector entities that catalyses growth for our industry.” Morley concluded. The two-day event includes both an international exhibition and a detailed conference programme spread across two stages with multiple free-to-attend sessions. The sixth edition in the annual cycle follows on from a record-breaking 2024 which saw more than 10,000 visitors converge on Dhahran Expo to do business and gain up-to-date knowledge from industry specialists.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa. Russia also struck the oil refining and gas transportation infrastructure in the Poltava region in central Ukraine.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas. Leading by Example “Port Tampa Bay believes nature and industry can coexist,” said Paul Anderson, Port Tampa Bay President & CEO. “Our partnership with DarkSky illustrates our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship. We’re proud to help pioneer this important program and guide the maritime industry toward more sustainable practices.” Throughout 2024, DarkSky and Port Tampa Bay engaged lighting designers, marine infrastructure experts, and environmental advocates to ensure the program meets both operational needs and ecological goals. The resulting guidelines are now available for adoption by other ports and marine facilities worldwide.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Towboat Hits Bridge On Colombia's Magdalena River,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towboat-hits-bridge-over-colombia-s-magdalena-river,,20/08/2025 00:00:08,,"On Sunday morning, a large towboat hit a bridge over the Magdalena River at Barrancabermeja, a refinery town about 160 miles north of Bogota, Colombia. At about 0615 hours, the towing vessel Ciudad de Medellin was operating near the Guillermo Gaviria Bridge, upriver from the Ecopetrol refinery. The river was rising due to heavy rains, and video from the scene shows that the current was running strong. While attempting a turn, the towboat had a hard allision with a bridge pier, resulting in extensive damage to the vessel. The top of the pilothouse was cut off as the towboat passed under the bridge. No injuries were reported, and good Samaritans arrived swiftly to help the crew. Video footage from the immediate aftermath suggests that the towboat took on water and listed to starboard after the casualty. The vessel partially sank by the stern by the time salvors arrived.

The towboat appears to have been outside of the navigation channel, according to local fishermen; the causes are under investigation. The operating company is arranging for a salvage operation to remove the wreckage and ensure safety of navigation. Ciudad de Medellin is a 2,000-horsepower towboat operated by Naviera Rio Grande.

Bulk of Oil Removed During Salvage of MSC Baltic III in Canada,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulk-of-oil-removed-during-salvage-of-msc-baltic-iii-in-canada,,19/08/2025 23:26:04,,"The Canadian Coast Guard signaled a milestone in the ongoing salvage operation for the MSC Baltic III, which grounded five months ago during a fierce winter storm off Newfoundland, Canada. After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

When Atlantic Treasure started taking on water overnight Sunday, the crew of the nearby fishing vessel Maid Of Amsterdam answered their mayday call and brought them to safety within hours. The Atlantic Treasure was under way on a fishing trip to the Grand Banks over the weekend. Late Sunday, the vessel suddenly began taking on water at a fast rate - possibly from a burst pipe, skipper Noah Deveau told CBC. Deveau had three crewmembers deploy the liferafts and gather all needed survival gear, then turned everyone else to the task of attempting to save the ship. The flooding overwhelmed the bilge pumps, and within a short period of time the Atlantic Treasure was taking water on deck. When the power to the pumps went out, Deveau had the crew abandon ship into the life raft while the deck lights were still lit. All hands made it safely aboard the raft and away from the sinking vessel. Deveau got a mayday out before abandoning ship, and Maid Of Amsterdam's skipper responded. The Amsterdam was about three hours away, headed back to port ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Erin. It diverted to meet up with the drifting raft, and in calm surface conditions, all Atlantic Treasure crewmembers transferred over safely and headed back for Nova Scotia. The timing of the rescue was fortunate: Hurricane Erin is expected to pass off the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on Saturday with winds of about 80-100 knots.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Bulker Suffers Cargo Hold Explosion in Baltimore Harbor,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bulker-suffers-cargo-hold-explosion-in-baltimore-harbor,,19/08/2025 04:19:15,,"On Monday night, a major explosion and fire occurred aboard a bulker in the Port of Baltimore's inner harbor, three miles from the site of the former Francis Scott Key Bridge. At 1830 hours local time, the vessel W Sapphire (IMO 9605645) was departing the CSX Curtis Bay coal pier in laden condition. Just off the dock, the vessel sustained a massive explosion in the forward hold, followed by a fire. A web cam operated by StreamTime captured video of the event, with some of the elements of the Key Bridge visible in the background. Multiple firefighting vessels responded immediately to the scene and began response efforts. According to the Baltimore City Fire Department, no injuries were reported on board, but the vessel sustained signs of explosion and fire damage. The fire has been extinguished and plans for the vessel are still being arranged, according to the Coast Guard. The captain of the port has established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the vessel. The cause of the blast is under investigation. Coal cargoes have known fire and explosion risks related to methane emissions, with the degree of risk varying by type of coal and the ventilation of the hold. The incident may resurface longstanding concerns about health and safety in fenceline communities around the 140-year-old coal pier. In a study published last month, researchers from Johns Hopkins found that ""the coal terminal is a significant driver of air pollution burdens"" in the Curtis Bay community. An on-terminal explosion occurred in 2021, caused by ""a localized build up of methane within the conveyor belt tunnel used to load coal to ships,"" according to the operator. The blast resulted in an airborne coal dust release, neighborhood complaints, a temporary shutdown and a $1.75 million settlement agreement. The coal pier is one of CSX's largest, and the rail company says that it is economically vital. ""It's important for both the global economy by ensuring coal reaches the market, and for our customers and the health of their business,"" said John Healy, CSX director of sales for export coal, in a statement last year.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Sir Anish Kapoor Designs Offshore Sector's First Public Art Installation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/sir-anish-kapoor-designs-offshore-sector-s-first-public-art-installation,,19/08/2025 03:59:56,,"Working with Greenpeace UK, sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor CBE has completed an unauthorized and potentially illegal modern art installation at a platform in the North Sea. It may be the first piece of ""fine art"" - designed and conceived by a figure from the modern art world - ever to debut aboard an offshore oil and gas structure, Greenpeace said in a statement. Kapoor, known best for public installations like ""The Bean"" on the Chicago waterfront and the ""Orbit"" sculptural tower in London, has a background in stainless steel and structural steel artworks, so the choice of a steel offshore platform is within keeping for his work. For the debut of this piece, Kapoor selected the Skiff wellhead platform, an outlying facility at the Brigantine gas field cluster. The platform is located in the North Sea about 60 nautical miles northeast of Bacton, a town on Britain's Norfolk coast. Without authorization from facility owner Shell, Greenpeace UK mobilized a climb team, a large canvas, and a 40-foot-tall ""frame"" of aluminum tubing to the Skiff site. In foggy but calm summer weather, the team boarded the platform from a RIB, assembled the frame and stretched the canvas across it. Then they hoisted a high-pressure hose to the top and sprayed about 250 gallons of food-based nontoxic dye onto the fabric, completing Kapoor's design.

Drunken Yacht Skipper Arrested Twice for Endangering Shipping in Rostock,https://maritime-executive.com/article/drunken-yacht-skipper-arrested-twice-for-endangering-shipping-in-rostock,,19/08/2025 02:39:57,,"Last week, a local yacht skipper landed in trouble with police in Rostock for drunk boating and endangering marine traffic - twice. On Wednesday, the skipper ran his eight-meter sailboat into a pier in Rostock's harbor. The pier happened to be near a turning point for ferry traffic, and the casualty - while minor in itself - forced the ferry Skane to halt a planned turn, according to VesselTracker. For any merchant vessel, this can become a dangerous situation: if an unexpected obstacle forces the pilot and master to deviate from the passage plan, the other alternatives may be less than ideal. The yacht sustained minor damage in the allision with the pier, but no water ingress. The state water police administered a breathalyzer test to the skipper upon responding to the scene. The 54-year-old man had a blood alcohol level of about 0.3 percent (BAC), consistent with severe intoxication, and the police filed charges against him for endangering shipping. While that investigation got under way, the man was released and allowed to return to his yacht. Two days later, his boat was spotted adrift in Dierkow Bay, headed for shore and apparently not under command. According to local outlet Focus, good Samaritans woke the man up by shouting and helped to secure the boat. Once again, police administered a breathalyzer test, and this time the skipper's blood alcohol level measured about 0.1 percent (BAC) - lower than before, but still well in excess of Germany's drunk-driving limits for motor vehicles. The run-in earned the man a second charge of endangering shipping traffic.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Protesters Block Asbestos-Removal Project for Classic Ferry at Brodosplit,https://maritime-executive.com/article/protesters-block-asbestos-removal-project-for-classic-ferry-at-brodosplit,,19/08/2025 01:55:28,,"Brodosplit Shipyard has landed in hot water with local residents over plans for restoring an aging cruise ship, the Moby Drea. The vessel has asbestos partition panels inside, and the shipyard's work plan called for removing them - but local citizens were not interested in the perceived risks, and pressed successfully for a government order for the ship's removal. Moby Drea (ex names Tor Britannia, Prince of Scandinavia) is a 1975-built cruise ferry, originally designed with fine lines and high speeds in mind. In service in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, the vessel made up to 27 knots with four Pielstick diesels. A 1998 refit added more steel amidships, increasing bed capacity, broadening the beam by about 10 feet and raising gross tonnage by about 6,000 GT. The cruise ferry is now 50 years old, well past the age for demolition for most commercial vessels. As recently as May, the ship was reported sold for delivery to Aliaga, Turkey for scrap value. However, on July 22, Croatian shipyard Brodosplit announced that it would be accepting Moby Drea into its facility for specialized asbestos removal work. Two days later, Shipping Italy confirmed that the vessel will be cleaned of asbestos, then moved to Piraeus for a refit for continued commercial service. The new owner is reportedly a bunkering company based in Messina, Med Fuel. The Moby Drea's interior contains metal partition panels with an asbestos core, amounting to about 350 tonnes of asbestos in total; the work will be performed by a contractor focused on this specific line of work, with special post-removal handling to minimize risk of environmental contamination. The ship arrived at Brodosplit under tow in late July, and its berthing was approved by local port authorities. But the project immediately met a speed bump: a citizens initiative to halt the work. The group organized protests outside the shipyard's gates in an attempt to prevent work from going forward, and it filed a petition with Croatia's government to demand the ship's removal, questioning whether the Moby Drea is undergoing repair or has another ultimate fate. For its part, Brodosplit said that the asbestos was fully encased in the panels and would be handled and disposed of safely. Air testing on board the ship was carried out and detected no sign of contamination before the start of work, the firm said in a statement to local media. Local sensitivities are high because of the region's history. Vranjic, a small town near Split, was once the site of a large asbestos construction material factory; the area has considerable experience with the dangers, including hundreds of fatalities over the decades. The public memory of trouble with asbestos is still alive and well, and - any statistical risk profile for the specifics of the Moby Drea project aside - protesters have expressed a strong desire to avoid returning to those days. Croatia's Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure has sided with residents and issued an order for the vessel's prompt removal from Brodosplit. The Moby Drea must be towed out of Croatia and its territorial seas by early September. Owner Med Fuel confirmed that on receipt of the stop work order on August 11, all construction activity was suspended, and none of the asbestos panels will be removed going forward. The owner is now solely focused on securing a safe tow to get Moby Drea out of Croatia, and the ministry has granted it an additional 15 days to complete the task. Split's port authority is assigned to oversee compliance. Top image: Moby Drea (Lucarelli / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58

Data Sector Consolidation for Shippers as Xeneta Buys eeSea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/data-sector-consolidation-for-shippers-as-xeneta-buys-eesea,,19/08/2025 01:05:47,,"The consolidation of the maritime data sector is continuing with freight and data logistics company Xeneta buying maritime and supply chain intelligence company eeSea. The move reflects the increasing sophistication of the shipping sector as companies increasingly use data to manage rapidly shifting markets. By adding eeSea’s market-leading global schedule, transit time, and reliability data to their existing range of freight rate data, Xeneta says it will enable BCO Procurement teams to manage freight contracts and suppliers based on service levels, and not just cost. They said to customers that it will help them to get the right service at the right price, no matter what the market conditions. “Coming together with eeSea, and combining our data and skills, furthers our shared mission to bring transparency and efficiency to how ocean freight is bought and sold,” said Patrik Berglund, Xeneta CEO. He said they would be able to provide customers with more actionable intelligence to control freight spend, as well as delivery reliability. Founded in 2012, Xeneta rose to prominence in the shipping community with its freight rate benchmarking and market analytics platform. More recently, it has increased its market analytics including adding well-known analyst and commentator Peter Sand to the team. It points to increasing challenges for shippers who need visibility on freight rates, contracts, and delays. It points to recent factors ranging from tariffs to wars, geopolitical challenges, and carriers' response with blank sailings and increased transshipment, as well as factors such as port congestion, all challenging shippers. “A true partnership between carriers and cargo owners relies not only on the freight rates paid, but also on the operational performance provided by the carrier, such as transit times, reliability, canceled sailings, weekly stability, and schedule forecasting accuracy,” says eeSea founder and CEO Simon Sundboell. eeSea was started a decade ago and has built its services focused on maritime and supply chain intelligence.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
The Launch of a Pure Battery-Powered EV Harbor Tugboat Development Project,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-launch-of-a-pure-battery-powered-ev-harbor-tugboat-development-project,,19/08/2025 00:56:27,,"[By: Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd.] Tokyo Kisen Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Yokohama; President & CEO: Hiroyuki Saito, hereinafter “Tokyo Kisen”) and Marindows Inc. (Head Office: Tokyo; CEO: Yasumasa Suetsugu, hereinafter “Marindows”) have officially launched Japan’s first pure battery-powered EV harbor tugboat development project. This EV harbor tugboat which will be operated in the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki is aiming to contribute to “zero GHG emissions from the ports” in accordance with the Carbon Neutral Port (CNP) policy. In January 2023, Tokyo Kisen put into service “TAIGA” which was the Japan’s first series-hybrid electric-powered tugboat equipped with a large-capacity 2,486 kWh battery. Building on two and a half years of operating experience with electric-powered tugs, this project advances to the next stage—enabling truly zero-emission (zero CO?) operations—by developing and constructing a pure battery-powered EV tugboat. This could be possible by the combination of a large-capacity onboard battery system (6.66 MWh) and MW-class fast chargers. Project and Vessel Overview Planned Schedule 2025: Detailed feasibility study and concept design. (Final construction decision will be made based on the results of the detailed FS including the concept design.) 2026: Basic design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2027: Detailed design (vessel, key equipment/systems, fast chargers). 2028: Construction starts of the vessel and fast-charging pier works. 2030: Commercial service starts at the ports of Yokohama and Kawasaki.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Seaspan and CSSC Complete Big Order Chinese-Financed in Local Currency,https://maritime-executive.com/article/seaspan-and-cssc-complete-big-order-chinese-financed-in-local-currency,,19/08/2025 00:23:32,,"Seaspan became the latest to jump into containership newbuilding, placing another big order with China State Shipbuilding. In addition to the size of the order, estimated by analysts at more than $1.2 billion, it is drawing attention as it is Chinese-financed and will be denominated in the Chinese currency, renminbi, extending China’s efforts to break free from linking newbuilds to the U.S. financial markets. As the largest independent containership leasing company, Seaspan rivals the largest carriers. It currently reports a capacity for its owned fleet of approximately 2.4 million TEU, which rivals Hapag-Lloyd as the first largest carrier by capacity. However, Seaspan’s fleet operates mostly on long-term charters to the major carriers. The company reports a fleet of 227 vessels (fully delivered, including current construction orders) and a 99 percent utilization rate. The new order is for a dozen 9,000 TEU ships to be financed by ICBC Financial Leasing. During the signing ceremony on August 15 at CSSC’s Hudong-Zhonghau Shipbuilding subsidiary, they highlighted the deal as a “prime example of the integrated development of “Made in China + China Financed,” which is a not-so-veiled response to the U.S.’s efforts to impose port fees on Chinese-built or operated vessels. CSSC hailed the order as “creating a new model for international ship trading.” There was no indication of which of Seaspan’s major customers will be the operator of the new ships, which are due for delivery by 2029. They said the ships will be conventionally fueled but have a mature linear design, an efficient powertrain, and a refined layout to maximize cargo space. Seaspan has grown rapidly and continues its pace since being taken private in an investor-led deal with management and participation by Ocean Shipping Network (ONE). In May, it was linked to a letter of intent for six 11,400 TEU vessels for COASCO. It is also reported to be building six methanol-ready 8,300 TEU vessels for COSCO.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Video: American SailGP Boat Suffers High-Speed Collision,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-american-sailgp-boat-suffers-high-speed-collision,,18/08/2025 23:08:53,,"America’s boat in the Rolex SailGP Grand Prix Season 25 event taking place in Sassnitz, Germany, over the weekend, suffered a catastrophic collision with its British rival. The boats were closing, each travelling at over 40 mph in heavy winds, when the collision occurred and caused significant damage. The American boat, which was sailing on port and therefore did not have priority, had its front hull sliced off by the rudder of the British boat. Luckily, and by the narrowest of margins, there were no casualties. In the spirit of the competition, the British boat was repaired overnight and sailed the next day with material salvaged from the American boat. The U.S. boat is owned by a group of high-profile sports star investors, chaired by founding Uber engineer Ryan McKillen. Damage after the high-speed collision (SailGP) Boats representing 12 countries are competing in a racing series that, like Formula 1 car racing, travels the world. The competition was founded by Russell Coutts and Larry Ellison in 2018. Events in the 2025 season have already taken place in Dubai, Auckland, Sydney, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Portsmouth, and Sassnitz, with races still to come in St Tropez, Geneva, Cadiz, and the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The F50 catamarans regularly reach speeds of over 60 mph when up on hydrofoils, with racecourses optimized for spectators viewing the racing on land. Each team competes with an identical boat, meaning that results are based on the skill of the crews and tactics adopted. The hydrofoils and rudders used on the boats are made of higher modulus carbon fiber, the strength of which was evident in the collision between the two boats last weekend. The hydrofoils are designed to delay the onset of cavitation, when air bubbles create friction and drag resistance. Crashes and capsizes are rare, but are high-impact events when they occur because of the speeds involved. Halfway through the 2025 series, Australia, New Zealand, and Spain are in the top three places, with the American boat falling out of contention, having started the weekend’s sailing at Sassnitz strongly.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Wan Hai 503 Remains at Sea 10 Weeks Seeking Port of Refuge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wan-hai-503-remains-at-sea-10-weeks-seeking-port-of-refuge,,18/08/2025 22:43:44,,"Ten weeks after the fire was reported aboard the containership Wan Hai 503, the vessel remains at sea in search of a port of refuge. It has turned into the vessel no one wants, as India almost immediately said it would not permit its ports to receive the ship, and more recently, Sri Lanka declined the application made for the vessel’s refuge. Owner/operator Wan Hai Lines issued its most recent update at the end of last week, reporting the vessel is stable and being monitored. “We, in close coordination with our appointed experts and the salvage team, are in the process of liaising with potential ports of refuge,” reported Wan Hai. “Decisions on the final port of refuge will take into account the overall suitability for the vessel as well as the handling of fire-damaged cargo.” The fire began on June 9 while the vessel was in India’s EEZ as it was sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Nhava Sheva, India. The Indian Coast Guard responded, assisting in the evacuation of the crew and an extensive firefighting effort. After salvage teams got secure tow lines, India, however, ordered the ship taken further out to sea, fearing a repeat of incidents such as the loss of X-Press Pearl and the ongoing problems after the MSC Elsa 3 sank weeks before the Wan Hai fire. As of July 24, India reported the vessel was outside its zone and that it was relinquishing involvement to the Maritime & Ports Authority of Singapore as the vessel’s flag state. Conditions aboard the vessel had dramatically improved with no more flames and only residual smoke in bays 29 to 35. Twenty salvers were reported aboard the ship, continuing cooling efforts and undertaking dewatering efforts. Conditions aboard as of mid-July (DGS) Wan Hai has continually reported since the end of July that the fire is extinguished and that teams continue to improve the onboard situation. However, Hapag-Lloyd, which shared cargo aboard the ship, confirmed on August 13, “The request for a port of refuge in Sri Lanka has been declined by the authorities.” They said the ship was 130 nautical miles from the Indian coast (Cape Comorin). The plan was to move it further out to sea while discussions continued on a port of refuge. This has continued, although the area is subjected to monsoons at this time of year. There is no clear determination for the direction of the ship and a potential resolution. It has been suggested it might be towed to the Middle East. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which suffered a container fire off the Indian coast, ended up gaining refuge at Khor Fakkan, in the UAE, in September 2024, about seven weeks after its fire started. That vessel, also, was not a constructive loss and returned to service. Similar salvage efforts to what are required for the Wan Hai 503 were recently completed in the Port of Aberdeen, Scotland, after the Solong was towed there after the collision and fire in the North Sea. The hulk was cleared of its debris in Scotland and arrived last week at a recycling facility in Belgium. Although a lot has been incinerated during the fire on the Wan Hai 503, the concerns raised continue to be about potential pollutants and the danger of the ship sinking.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Lost and Found: Navy Yard Logbook From the Pearl Harbor Attack,https://maritime-executive.com/article/lost-and-found-navy-yard-logbook-from-the-pearl-harbor-attack,,18/08/2025 22:32:10,,"By miraculous coincidence, conservators at the U.S. National Archives have recovered the logbook for Pearl Harbor Naval Base for the period before and after the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941. It is the only record of its kind from the ""date which will live infamy,"" and it was nearly lost to a trash bin before finding its way into private hands, according to the previous owners. The logbook covers the status of vessels in the yard during the period from March 1941 to June 1942, a period of extremely rapid and momentous events. During the time period when the first entries, the U.S. was on a peacetime footing and was in diplomatic talks with Japan; nine months later, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entered the war; and by the end of the logbook, just seven months further on, the U.S. Navy won strategic victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, and was gearing up to retake the Solomon Islands. The log nearly didn't make it. According to Michael William Bonds, who inherited it from his mother Oretta Kanady, the recordbook somehow ended up at Norton Air Force Base in California, where Kanady worked as a civilian employee in the 1970s. Bonds told the Washington Post that Kanady found the logbook in a trash bin and asked if she could take it home. It wasn't classified, and she received permission. Bonds took possession of it when she passed in 2000, and has had it in storage ever since. Only recently did he realize what it was, and its exceptional historical value. The record documents moments of tragedy and triumph for Pacific Fleet. It notes the untimely arrival of USS Oklahoma and USS Arizona on December 5, just in time for their destruction at the hands of Japanese pilots two days later. On the page for December 7, it details the time of arrival of the first Japanese aircraft, and the time of arrival and departure of Navy warships in response to the strike (top). On the morning of December 8, as salvors dealt with the aftermath of the attack, the log noted that the capsized hull of the battleship USS Utah ""appears to be drifting out into channel,"" recommending a tug to be sent to secure the wreck. It also shows the Pearl Harbor yard's essential work in repairing Navy warships after the Japanese attack, putting cruisers and destroyers back in the fight after severe damage. Within six months, the yard had taken in and redelivered the damaged battleships Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Tennessee; cruisers Honolulu, Helena, and Raleigh; destroyers Helm and Shaw; and three auxiliaries, all fully repaired or patched up for transit for permanent repairs.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Fincantieri Sues Citing $100M in Damages from Fraudulent Fire Insulation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fincantieri-sues-citing-100m-in-damages-from-fraudulent-fire-insulation,,18/08/2025 21:40:15,,"Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri is suing the manufacturer of fire insulation panels it used in the construction of three cruise ships and eight military ships, alleging fraud and misrepresentation that it says caused over $100 million in economic damages as well as reputational harm. The shipbuilder is alleging that Paroc Group, which is owned by Owens Corning, obtained safety certificates under “false pretenses by submitting altered materials for testing,” and conspired to maintain the fraud and sell a defective product which endangered safety. Paroc Group, which was acquired by Owens Corning in 2018, launched a new line of stonewool insulation products sold as fire safety panels for marine applications. The Navis line was promoted as a lighter-weight, fire-safe marine insulation for use in steel decks and bulkheads. Fincantieri reports that it and its subcontractors selected and began using the product in 2019 for both cruise ships and military vessels that required materials meeting the Class A-60 fire integrity standard. A-60 is the highest-rated fire insulation material under the SOLAS regs and is designed to prevent the transfer of heat for a minimum of 60 minutes. It is typically used for steel bulkheads, such as with galleys or casings, to provide protection from the potential to transfer heat and fire aboard a vessel. Fincantieri reports that it relied on the certification and the repeated assurances of the supplier for the integrity of the material. In 2023, a competitor of Owens Corning Paroc reported that it tested certain of the Navis products and found that they “did not in fact meet the fire integrity standards for Class A-60 products.” The competitor lodged a complaint, and independent testing by the Danish Institute of Fire and Security Technology in April 2023 confirmed the products were not compliant. They allege in the suit that it required a deliberate effort to undermine the initial testing process leading to the certification. They further state that the fraud required manipulation of testing materials and repeated and coordinated falsification. The product was recalled in May 2023, but Fincantieri writes in the lawsuit complaint that it “did not advise or instruct that any remedial actions be taken for completed vessels in service.” The Navis line was discontinued as of May 31, 2024. Fincantieri identified that it used the product on a total of 11 ships, including the already delivered Discovery Princess, which went into service for Carnival Corporation’s Princess Cruises in March 2022, as well as two luxury cruise ships, Explora I and Explora II, under construction for MSC’s Explora Journeys. The other eight vessels, including two under construction, are military vessels. Delivery of MSC’s Explora I was postponed for 21 days due to the need to replace the defective products. Fincantieri says it also delayed the delivery of Explora II in 2024 and Carnival Corporation’s Sun Princess being built for Princess Cruises. Fincantieri says that it is incurring over $100 million in harm. It says the direct costs include to investigate, repair, and remediate affected vessels, as well as increasing construction costs. It also incurred liquidated damages and other costs resulting from delayed deliveries. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio, where Owens Corning is headquartered. The corporation, a leader in building materials, was involved in more than 20 years of litigation related to the use of asbestos in shipbuilding materials before filing for bankruptcy and settling those suits in 2000.",Maritime Executive,23/08/2025 14:06:58
Maersk Reports Crew Stopped Spread of Container Fire on Vessel Off Africa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/maersk-reports-crew-stopped-spread-of-container-fire-on-vessel-off-africa,,18/08/2025 20:44:41,,"The container fire, which began last week on one of Maersk’s larger boxships, Marie Maersk, is believed to have stopped spreading, as firefighting efforts are expected to intensify. The 19,000 TEU vessel remains off the coast of Africa while the company is considering a port of refuge as the first step toward determining the full extent of the damage. “This was also achieved thanks to the assistance of four assets, three tugboats and a Platform Supply Vessel,” said Maersk in its update. The company said the vessels had brought firefighting equipment to the Marie Maersk over the past days, and AIS signals show they remain in proximity to the ship. “We expect firefighting efforts to intensify further once the external firefighters can board Marie Maersk.” The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the vessel early on August 13 while they were bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and China. Maersk has said the crew remains safe with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational. The Marie Maersk was diverted towards the West African coast to get landside support as fast as possible, and because of the large number of vessels diverting around Africa, additional Maersk vessels and others have also been in the vicinity. “Due to the prevailing conditions in the respective cargo bays, we still cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on the cargo yet,” Maersk stated. The goal is to get the vessel into a port of refuge where they can offload damaged containers and complete an inspection to determine the extent of the spread of the fire, smoke, and heat. The company has not said how many containers are aboard currently, but because they are outbound from Europe, it is possible the vessel is not fully loaded or is carrying empties. Maersk reports the vessel will be diverted to a port of refuge, which is under contemplation. The goal is to get landside support as fast as possible. The challenge is also finding a port that is willing to accept the vessel and has the capabilities to handle a container fire. In the case of the Maersk Frankfurt, which caught fire off India in July 2024, after the fire was brought under control, the vessel diverted to the Middle East. Another operator, X-Press Feeders, is again highlighting that ports in Qatar, India, and Sri Lanka refused permission when its vessel X-Press Pearl was desperately seeking refuge with a leaking container that ultimately caught fire and contributed to the total loss of the vessel.

Trump Administration Orders “Stop Work” on 80% Installed Offshore Wind Farm,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-orders-stop-work-on-80-complete-offshore-wind-farm,,24/08/2025 00:38:20,,"In a surprising move on Friday, August 22, the Trump administration took action against an 80 percent installed offshore wind farm being built by Denmark’s Ørsted and a subsidiary of BlackRock. The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a “halt to ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind project on the outer continental shelf (OCS) to allow time for it to address concerns that have arisen.” Unlike previous orders, which stopped projects before construction commenced, Revolution Wind has been under construction since 2024. Ørsted reports that the project is 80 percent complete, with all its offshore foundations installed and 45 out of 65 wind turbines installed. Steel in the water started in May 2024, and the first turbine installation was completed in September. The company says Revolution Wind is employing hundreds of local union workers both on and offshore and that approximately two million labor union hours have been spent on the project. The shore operations are at ProvPort and Quonset in Rhode Island, and State Pier in New London, Connecticut. BOEM was vague in its reasoning, writing in the letter to Ørsted North America that it is “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interest of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas and the territorial seas.” The letter signed by Acting Director of BOEM Matthew Giacona also refers to “concerns that have arisen” during its review under the President’s Memorandum of January 20 which directed agencies to review the industry. “Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously,” the company said in a statement confirming it was complying and taking steps to stop offshore activities. “This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution, as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026.” In its statement, the company notes the project spent more than nine years in review and is fully permitted. It received approval of its Construction and Operations Plan in November 2023. Revolution Wind is located more than 15 miles south of Rhode Island and 32 miles southeast of Connecticut, with power contracts with both states. The nearest point of land is Martha’s Vineyard with the project approximately 12 miles southwest. Power was expected to start by the spring of 2026, and when the project is completed, it would generate a total of 704 MW, with 400 MW going to Rhode Island and 304 MW to Connecticut. Ørsted points out that the project is using the same turbine technology as South Fork Wind, which was completed as the first large, commercial offshore wind farm in the United States in 2024. The stop work order pertains to all offshore activities on the OCS. The company can continue any emergency or safety work, as well as onshore activities. BOEM says the project may appeal this determination. Ørsted said in its statement that it is considering “a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.” The company is 50 percent owned by the Danish state, and just announced it was facing financial challenges due to the actions of the new U.S. government. It launched a rights offering to raise $9 billion from existing shareholders, which it is said is necessary to fund the construction work for another U.S. wind farm, Sunrise Wind, as well as completing Revolution Wind, after investors determined the risks are too great in the U.S. market based on the uncertainties raised by the Trump administration’s assault on wind energy. Last year, Eversource sold its 50 percent interest in its partnership with Ørsted to Global Infrastructure Partners and its Skyborn Renewables fund. GIS was acquired last year by BlackRock to expand the group's investment in renewable energy and infrastructure, with BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, reported to be a friend and supporter of Donald Trump. This is the second time the administration has issued a stop work order on an offshore wind farm. In April, the Department of the Interior suspended licenses to Equinor just as offshore work was due to begin on the Empire Wind project off New York. The suspension lasted for a month and drew broad criticism, while there were reports of pressure, including from the Norwegian government, which owns Equinor. There were reports of a deal where New York State will permit an oil pipeline it was blocking in exchange for the lifting of the stop work order on Empire Wind. Equinor reported it would take a $1 billion impairment charge related to the impact of the U.S. actions on the project and the offshore wind industry. Last week, the Trump administration also announced a further review of the manufacture of wind turbines and their components. Trump has repeatedly said they are made in China, although none of the U.S. projects are using Chinese turbines. The Commerce Department was ordered to start a trade investigation citing national security concerns over the importing of components for wind energy projects. Experts point out that 40 percent of the components for wind energy projects come from Europe, while Mexico is supplying more than 30 percent of the material used in the construction. The Trump administration has said it will include aluminum and steel components for wind turbines in the 50 percent tariff on imports, and the new trade investigation could impose further tariffs on components. The administration has already suspended future licensing and revoked previous approvals. Trump has promised to “stop the windmills.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Coast Guard Arrests Intoxicated MSC Containership Captain After Ship Docks,https://maritime-executive.com/article/coast-guard-arrests-intoxicated-msc-containership-captain-after-ship-docks,,23/08/2025 23:26:40,,"The US Coast Guard arrested the master of a containership this week after the pilot guiding the ship to port reported the captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 04:51:44
Chicago Propeller Club Hears Industry Cry from MARAD Acting Administrator,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chicago-propeller-club-hears-industry-cry-from-marad-acting-administrator,,24/08/2025 00:47:04,,"[By: Chicago Propeller Club] The United States has entered a new era of maritime strength, the head of the Maritime Administration told the Chicago Propeller Club’s flagship summer event at Chicago Yacht Club. In a speech to guests including all the Great Lakes Port Directors, Acting Administrator Sang Yi said America will invest in four keys areas – people, ships, cargo, and ports. “This is a pivotal time. We are in a new era thanks to President Trump bringing back U.S. maritime power stronger than ever. It is time to make your voice heard. For too long our U.S. maritime industry has been ignored. Yet the maritime industry is vital for our economic strength and national security. We are going to work hard every day to make it stronger. We are going to help build the best maritime workforce in the world. We are going to boost demand for U.S. shipping. And we are going to invest in our ports.” The audience of more than 100 senior figures from ports, shipping, logistics, marine services and infrastructure sectors warmly applauded Acting Administrator Yi’s speech. The reception, sponsored by J.D. Fields, a national leader in steel products and infrastructure solutions, provided a welcome opportunity for networking with key figures in the maritime industry on the eve of the American Great Lakes Ports Association annual conference in Chicago. Chris Carr, president of the Chicago Propeller Club, encouraged guests to continue to back the club after it was named International Port of the Year in 2024 after rechartering following a 16 year hiatus: “We really appreciate the great turnout from membership and ports leadership.” Chicago Propeller Club vice president Ben Pinnington welcomed the AGLPA conference to Chicago for a third year: “The AGLPA conference is important because under the new administration maritime has its highest profile arguably since World War II. It is vital that the Great Lakes and Midwest projects its maritime prowess to the USA to attract investment.” Deb Deluca, recently retired executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, received a special award in recognition of her achievements from AGLPA executive director Brian Oszakiewski and Port of Monroe executive director Paul La Marre. And she called on everyone present to combine their efforts and make the voice of the maritime industry stronger in Washington DC. “Working together our potential is so much greater and it will strengthen our voice in Washington,” she urged. Jackie Carter the Port of Milwaukee director was also honored on the evening as she moves to a new role with the City of Milwaukee. In a look to the future, Jack Dougherty, co-founder and owner of autonomous shipping company Janus Marine and Defense underscored the need for the maritime industry to embrace new technologies, stay ahead of the competition, increase operational efficiency and job safety, and boost national security. In addition, veteran led Chicago charity No Salt Sailing made an appeal for support. The charity helps veterans and their families cope with PTSD by learning to sail on the Great Lakes.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

A field sobriety and breathalyzer test administered by the USC after the vessel docked found the captain was impaired more than six times the legal limit for commercial mariners. The vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX, is a 108,770 dwt containership with a capacity of 8,800 TEU. The ship had arrived in the anchorage near Everett, Washington, coming from Busan, South Korea, with a stop in Vancouver, Canada. Built in 2008, the vessel, which is registered in Liberia, appears to have joined the MSC fleet in March 2025. A Puget Sound pilot boarded the MSC Jubilee IX on August 20 to guide the ship to port in Seattle and reported to the US Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound that the vessel’s captain was exhibiting signs of intoxication. The pilot and first mate operated the vessel during the transit from an anchorage to Terminal 5 at the Port of Seattle without incident. After the vessel docked, a Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service boarded the ship and commenced a port state control examination. During the investigation, they administer the sobriety test. The captain was arrested and transported to the King County Jail, where charges were referred to the King County Prosecutor for boating under the influence. The vessel was detained by the Coast Guard until a relief captain was identified and confirmed. The vessel was later cleared to resume operations and departed Seattle on August 22 for Prince Rupert, Canada, and a return trip to Yantian, China. The incident is similar to a January 2024 arrest when the captain of another MSC containership, a Polish national commanding MSC Roshney V, was also detained after the pilot in Felixstowe in the UK also suspected the master was intoxicated. Tests revealed his blood alcohol level was nearly four times over the limit. The master pleaded guilty in a UK court and was given a suspended sentence and a small fine. He told the court he was sorry for his actions and that his career at sea was over.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Le Groupe ALMACO to Outfit Canadian Coast Guard’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-to-outfit-canadian-coast-guard-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,23/08/2025 21:24:45,,"[By: ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed an over 100M CAD Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada’s premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie’s skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie’s facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group’s Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec’s role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada’s broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO’s role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province’s advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO’s Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada’s Maritime Future “Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,” said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. “We’ve maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We’re not just outfitting a ship—we’re helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together.” “Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. “Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada.” Davie is a key player in Canada’s National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. “This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada’s shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. “The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,” said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. “Davie’s leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,” said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. “The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions’ naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec’s position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century.” A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group. Their previous partnership to deliver the CSS Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy in 2017 created lasting impact on the Canadian and international maritime industries. The Polar Max contract highlights the trust and shared commitment to delivering top-tier marine outfitting and advancing shipbuilding excellence in Canada. Introducing Mobile Cabin Factory for Modular Cabins A local “cabin factory” will be established in Québec. This facility, a first of its kind in Canada, will allow Le Groupe ALMACO to produce pre-fabricated modular cabins on site, significantly improving project logistics, efficiency, and quality assurance. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie’s shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

"U.S. Seizes 13,000 Pounds of Cocaine in Operation Pacific Viper",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-seizes-13-000-pounds-of-cocaine-in-operation-pacific-viper,,23/08/2025 02:30:15,,"The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is carrying out another major operation in its fight against drug cartels and human smuggling in the Eastern Pacific. Recent efforts in coordination with the U.S. Navy have already led to the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of 11 suspects. Homeland Security announced that just days after the USCG embarked on Operation Pacific Viper with the deployment of large numbers of forces and warships to fight Latin American drug cartels, the results are evident. In a matter of days, the agency has hunted down, interdicted, and boarded several illegal vessels, resulting in seizures and arrests. The first seizure happened on August 8 when the Legend-class cutter Hamilton interdicted a drug smuggling vessel south of Mexico, seizing over 4,000 pounds of cocaine and arresting three smugglers. Three days later, the Navy guided missile destroyer Sampson was operating in the known drug trafficking corridor when she interdicted a smuggling boat. Sailors, together with USCG Law Enforcement Detachment officers onboard, identified the suspicious vessel, prompting the launch of MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter and a rigid-hull inflatable boat to intercept it. Destroying smugglers' boats (USCG) The smuggling vessel attempted to flee with the traffickers trying to dump their cargo overboard before they were subdued, leading to the seizure of about 1,300 pounds of cocaine and the arrest of two suspects. Due to deteriorating seaworthiness and heavy seas, the smuggling vessel was left to sink. In yet another case on August 16, USCG cutter Stone interdicted a smuggling vessel south of the Galapagos Islands, with officers disabling it by shooting its engine out from a helicopter. Three suspected drug smugglers were detained with over 3,500 pounds of cocaine being confiscated. The vessel was set on fire. A day later, Stone carried out another interdiction, disabling the engine on a smuggler’s vessel with fire from a helicopter. It resulted in the arrest of three smugglers and the seizure of over 4,000 pounds of cocaine. The suspects arrested in the two cases are said to be Ecuadorian nationals. Another seizure of nearly 3,000 pounds of cocaine occurred on August 19 after Stone yet again interdicted a smuggling vessel. On the same day, a boat launched from the Reliance-class medium endurance cutter Venturous seized over 750 pounds of cocaine that was jettisoned by a target of interest. Seized cocaine on the deck of USS Sampson (Homeland Security) “80 percent of illicit drug seizures occur at sea,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The U.S. Coast Guard is surging maritime interdictions in the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations, cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.” Operation Pacific Viper is taking place while reports indicate that President Donald Trump has also ordered the deployment of three warships off the coast of Venezuela to intensify the fight against drug trafficking. Reuters is reporting that the Aegis guided-missile destroyers USS Graverly, John Dunham, and Sampson, and a contingent of 4,000 sailors and marines are designed to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, for whom the U.S. is offering a $50 million reward for his arrest over his alleged links to cocaine trafficking.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Port of Auckland Gets Greenlight for Expansion Under New Fast-Track Regime,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/port-of-auckland-gets-greenlight-for-extension-under-new-fast-track-regime,,23/08/2025 01:58:35,,"The Port of Auckland in New Zealand is finally set to embark on major infrastructure expansion projects aimed at enhancing its competitiveness. It is proceeding after getting a government greenlight under a new law designed to cut red tape in the approval process for huge infrastructure and development projects. Under the Fast-track Approvals Act, Auckland’s wharf expansion project has become the first mega project to be granted consent. The greenlight now allows New Zealand’s main import terminal to proceed with the implementation of the Bledisloe North and Fergusson North projects, as well as the construction of a cruise passenger terminal and other upgrades. The consent was granted by an expert panel set up under the Act, which was introduced in Parliament in March last year and enacted in record speed as part of the coalition government’s plan for its first 100 days in office. The Act, which received Royal Assent in December and became effective in February, establishes a permanent fast-track regime that makes it easier and quicker for large projects to gain approvals. The decision came just 66 working days after the panel was convened. “The Act helps cut through the tangle of red and green tape and the jumble of approvals processes that have, until now, held New Zealand back from much-needed economic growth,” said Chris Bishop, New Zealand Infrastructure Minister. Having become the first to get approval under the act, the Port of Auckland will, starting next month, embark on implementing key projects that are critical to future growth. The Bledisloe and Fergusson wharves expansion forms the core of the projects that will not only allow berthing of larger containerships but also make Auckland a hub for cruise shipping. The Bledisloe North wharf project will include a new reinforced concrete-piled wharf at the terminal, giving it enough depth for large cruise ships and RoRos. For Fergusson North, the project involves a wharf extension that will enable the port to handle 10,000 TEU ships in the future. Currently, the port can only handle ships with a 5,000 TEU maximum capacity. Auckland has termed the projects as once-in-a-generation infrastructure that is needed to serve the city for decades to come, not only by making the port “big ship capable” but also by providing long-term fit-for-purpose infrastructure. In February, the port that is owned by the Auckland Council revealed it intends to invest NZ$120 to NZ$150 million (US$70 to $88 million) over the next three to four years in infrastructure expansion. “The Bledisloe North wharf extensions will enable larger cruise ships to berth, and increase New Zealand’s importing and exporting capacity,” said Bishop. The project will deliver lasting economic benefits by boosting the efficiency of a critical part of Auckland’s economy and supporting long-term growth. Auckland’s infrastructure investments come when the port, the second largest after Port of Tauranga, is recording growth in container throughput to hit the 900,000 TEU mark in 2024. The Auckland project was among a total of 149 projects on the fast-track list, with others involved in mining, power, and residential development, among others, being under consideration.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
APM Terminals Plans $1B Investment to Develop Indian Ports,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/apm-terminals-plans-1b-investment-to-develop-indian-ports,,23/08/2025 01:40:03,,"APM Terminals, the terminal operations for AP Moller-Maersk, has entered into an agreement with the authority overseeing ports on India’s east coast along the Bay of Bengal. Under the Memorandum signed in India on August 22, they plan to explore the development of ports to create an “Eastern Gateway” as part of India’s plan to expand trade. According to officials, the agreement while help realize the vision of creating Andhra Pradesh as the logistics hub of the east. The region has more than 620 miles of coastline. The vision is to develop marine infrastructure such as ports, fishing harbors, and fish landing centers every 30 miles. The region is currently home to Visakhapatnam, a port city and industrial center, which is the third-largest port by volume in India and one of the country’s 12 major ports. However, it is mostly a bulker port with smaller container operations in the region. The coast currently hosts a total of 15 ports in eight coastal districts, with five operational non-major commercial ports and four green field projects, which will be operational by 2026. Working with APM, the goal is to accelerate port and terminal development in the state. APM has expressed its intent as part of the MoU to invest approximately $1 billion to modernize ports and terminals. They will focus on the development of the Machilipatnam, Mulapeta, and Ramayapatnam ports and infrastructure. These are three of the ports currently being developed by the authority in the region. In June, the local authorities reported that Ramayapatnam Port was the most advanced with Phase 1 work nearly two-thirds (64 percent) completed. Both Machilipatnam and Mulapeta have completed more than 40 percent of their Phase 1 development. APM is seen as a logical partner for the next phase of development, with the local officials noting that it is at the forefront of introducing advanced cargo handling technologies, promoting sustainable operations, and enhancing efficiency in container and bulk handling. APM Terminals has been present in India since 2004 and operates two key assets. The Gujarat Pipavav Port is located 152 nautical miles (10 hours steaming time) from Nhava Sheva in Mumbai. It was India’s first public-private port operation and has a capacity for 1.35 million TEU annually. APM is also in partnership with India for the operations of APM Terminals Mumbai (Gateway Terminals India), which is the largest container facility in the country. Efforts are currently expanding its capacity above 2 million TEU annually.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Alaska Carrier is Latest to Suspend Transport of EVs Due to Fire Risk,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/alaska-carrier-is-latest-to-suspend-transport-of-evs-due-to-fire-risk,,23/08/2025 00:18:59,,"Fire concerns and the potential for toxic, runaway fires spurred by lithium-ion batteries continue to weigh heavily on the shipping industry. Lynden’s Alaska Marine Lines has become the latest carrier to report it will no longer ship electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles due to the increased safety risk. The company operates a vital cargo barge service across Alaska as well as to Hawaii. It is a vital connection for moving commercial freight and is used by Alaskans for shipping materials or to bring items from the “Lower 48.” “Although we have previously shipped EVs and PHEVs, the increased complexity and fire risk associated with shipping large lithium-ion batteries on vessels at sea has caused us to reevaluate how to best keep our employees and equipment safe. While issues with lithium-ion batteries are infrequent, the inability to extinguish or contain this type of fire, especially while at sea, can lead to catastrophic results,” the company said in a customer statement released on August 12. The new policy is effective immediately for Central Alaska, Western Alaska, and Hawaii. The company said it would continue to carry the vehicles for the next few weeks until September 1 for Southeast Alaska. The decision does not impact other hybrid vehicles, smaller electric recreational vehicles, e-bikes, and four-wheelers. Alaska Marine Lines said it will continue to reassess the ability to safely ship these vehicles as industry standards and safety procedures improve. Alaska Public Media highlights that the restrictions will be especially hard for the Southeast, where electric vehicles are growing in popularity. It reports that the State of Alaska’s Alaska Marine Highway System and its ferries will continue limited transport of EVs. The ferry system limits just two EVs per trip, and a spokesperson told KCAW Alaska that special precautions are in place on the ferries. They have designated spaces with more area around the two spots for EVs, and each ferry carries two special fire blankets designed to smother EV battery fires. Alaska Marine Lines’ policy follows a similar decision announced by Matson in June. The carrier reported that its vessel from California to Hawaii and Guam would no longer transport EVs despite the precautions that it had put in place to control possible fires. Similar policies have also emerged in Europe. Havila, for example, which carries cars on the Norwegian Coastal voyages, announced in 2023 that it was banning EVs and hydrogen vessels from its ships.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Equinor Will Not Proceed with Australian Offshore Wind Projects,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/equinor-will-not-proceed-with-australian-offshore-wind-projects,,22/08/2025 23:26:03,,"Equinor, one of the leading developers in the offshore and renewable energy industry, is not proceeding with its development projects in Australia, marking another setback for the developing industry. The Norwegian company had been working in Australia for the past few years and was positioned to be one of the first to develop a project. Australia’s Energy Minister, Chris Bowen, said that Equinor and its Australian partner, Oceanex Energy, had been unable to agree on terms for the next phase of the development project. They had been selected by the government in February to receive a feasibility license to proceed with the research for the project, but according to Bowen, the company has decided to decline the license for the proposed Novocastrian Offshore Wind Farm. Oceanex has spent years developing the plan and the local expertise for the project, which is one of the projects selected for the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The plan calls for a mega 2 GW floating wind farm located more than 12 miles offshore south of Newcastle. The proposed timeline expected construction to begin in 2028 and operations by 2031. No official reason was given for the decision not to proceed, but it is being pointed out that Equinor has withdrawn from a number of projects both in Australia and elsewhere in recent months. Novocastrian was positioned according to Oceanex to be “at the forefront of deep-water deployment.” Equinor had launched its partnership with Oceanex in 2022, citing the strong potential for offshore wind energy in Australia and the government’s strong desire to develop the industry. Oceanex is also developing offshore plans for the Illawarra and South Coast regions. Equinor last month quietly withdrew from another project, its third in Australia, the Bass Offshore Wind Energy project. To be located near Tasmania in the Bass Strait, it calls for 70 to 100 turbines with a capacity of 1.5 GW. Equinor was working with the Australian company Nexsphere, which assumed full ownership of Bass from Equinor. Unlike Novocastrain, Bass has not yet been selected for a feasibility license. Bowen said that Oceanex wants to continue to pursue the project, but it lacks the access to capital required. He believes that both Oceanex and Nexsphere will be shopping for new international partners. The changing economics for offshore wind energy and the challenges of developing a new market have weighed heavily on Australia’s plans. Last month, Blue Float Energy, which is developing the plans for a Victoria offshore project, reported it was not proceeding. The plan calls for a 2 GW project for the Gippsland region, but reports said the company’s lead investor, Quantum Capital, determined the project was no longer commercially viable. The changing economics have also challenged projects in other parts of the world. Ørsted recently announced it would not proceed with the Hornsea 4 project in the UK in its current proposed form. The company has also reported that it was unable to secure an investment partner in the United States for its Sunrise Wind project. It is planning to sell rights to its current shareholders to raise more than $9 billion, which will primarily be used to complete construction of the U.S. project. Bowen reiterated that the Australian government remains firmly committed to renewable energy. Analysts, however, question whether the government can meet its goals as the leading offshore projects have stalled before reaching feasibility and the final investment decision.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

The ship has resumed sailing as it works to get additional help from shore in its efforts to extinguish the fire. “One container, which has been flooded with water, still shows an elevated temperature while being under control,” reports a spokesperson for Maersk. “Marie Maersk is sailing slowly eastwards off the West African coast to meet another supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment which will be loaded onboard.” The last AIS signal from the containership showed it sailing at more than 10 knots eastward into the Gulf of Guinea. It had been holding off Liberia on the West Coast during the first phase of the firefight. The ship was bound from Rotterdam to Malaysia and then China when the smoke was spotted on the morning of August 13. The ship initially moved closer to shore so that equipment and personnel could be brought out to aid the efforts. An external firefighting team boarded the vessel on Tuesday, August 19. Maersk reports together with the crew of Marie Maersk, they have the fire under control, while it is still not completely extinguished. “The expert Crisis Response Team of Maersk remains in constant touch with the vessel crew, salvage operator, flag state authority, and classification society to take qualified decisions about the next steps,” the spokesperson told The Maritime Executive on August 22. The port of destination is “under contemplation,” with the goal of finding the best solution for the crew, Maersk’s customers and their cargo. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU, but it is unclear exactly how many containers are currently aboard and how many might be empties. Maersk says that due to the prevailing conditions in the affected cargo bays, it cannot confirm the exact impact of the fire on each container. The expectation is that the ship will be taken to a port of refuge to offload the damaged containers and ascertain the full extent of the damage.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Witherby Publishing Group's owners are delighted to announce the signing of an exclusive MoU between themselves and Steve Richards and Cathy Wallwork of VIRSEC. Capt. Macneil, CEO of Witherbys and original founder of Seamanship International said, ""while it's been a while since we stepped away from CBT creation to focus on our takeover of Witherbys and expanding that portfolio of technical, operational and compliance guidelines, I always felt we may well return to the CBT sector under the right circumstances. We have been extremely impressed with VIRSEC and indeed, as part of my own re-qualification as Master Unlimited in 2024, I used their online STCW Ship Security Officer (SSO) course: while onboard ship, in my own time, at a pace that suited me, prior to successfully completing an online examination to receive an MCA Approved Certificate. Since then we have looked more closely at the company and its owners and feel their style and values align with our own. Their sharp focus on their area of expertise and their accreditation from bodies such as the MCA and ABS makes them the ideal partner, and we very much look forward to adding our maritime expertise to their undoubted security and course creation skills. With an initial focus on security aspects such as: Port Security, Drug Trafficking, Piracy and Armed Robbery, Cyber Security, Stowaways and Distressed People in Small Boats, it is our intention to specialise in the training required for compliance and certification before expanding the portfolio in support of STCW, SOLAS, MARPOL and the ISM Code. Our last foray into CBT was the highly successful internal competence management system developed for Shell, and we are really pleased to be moving back into this area alongside this excellent small company.” Steve Richards, Operations Director at VIRSEC added: “We are really excited to be working with Witherbys on this Joint Venture and view this as a unique opportunity to transform how maritime professionals access and experience training.

New Zealand Looks to Future for Troubled Interisland Ferry Service,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-zealand-looks-to-future-for-troubled-interisland-ferry-service,,22/08/2025 21:12:48,,"August has marked what many hope will be a turning point and the start of a new beginning for New Zealand’s KiwiRail and its troubled interisland ferry service. It reports that the previous iReX ferry program has been brought to a close with a final settlement with the shipyard, and this week it retired its oldest vessel as the first step in the modernization program. The company provides a vital passenger and freight operation running RoRo ferries between the North and South islands. According to company data, each year it moves US$8.5 billion in freight, making more than 4,000 crossings. The company says it transports nearly 800,000 passengers and 250,000 cars annually on three vessels, the oldest of which was built in 1988, while the others were built in 1995 and 1998. With government support, in 2020, it announced plans for two much larger ferries to enter service in 2025 and 2026. Each would have been 50,000 gross tons with a capacity for more than 1,900 passengers, versus the current ships, which have a maximum capacity of 650 passengers. They would also have accommodated 650 passenger cars versus the current 250. Contracts were signed in 2021 with Korea’s Hyundai Mipo Dockyard to build the vessels, which were to be hybrids with battery-electric power. A new government elected in 2023 was critical of the project and reported it was canceling funding in part due to runaway cost estimates. KiwiRail terminated the order and began settlement negotiations with Hyundai Mipo. Last week, it was reported that a final settlement was completed at a cost of NZ$144 million (US$84.6 million). Along with a previous payment, KiwiRail reports the total cost was NZ$222 million (US$130 million) to Hyundai Mipo and an additional NZ$449 million (US$264 million), including costs of landside infrastructure. “Doomsayers said cancelling the contract would cost the taxpayer the full NZ$551 million contract value, but these are some of the same people who accepted Project iReX ballooning from NZ$1.45 billion when approved in 2021 to Treasury warning it was on course to NZ$4 billion in 2023 thanks to eyes-bigger-than-their-mouths ambitions and absentee management,” said Ministers Nicola Willis (Finance) and Winston Peters (Foreign Affairs), in a joint statement on the settlement agreement. They contend that there was not sufficient consideration given to the port infrastructure requirements for the two massive ferries. After winning the election, they allege they were confronted with “billion-dollar blowouts” due to the mismanagement by the prior government of the infrastructure projects. “KiwiRail remains focused on working with Ferry Holdings Limited and the port companies to deliver two new rail-enabled ferries and the required infrastructure upgrades in Wellington and Picton by 2029. We’re looking forward to ensuring the safe and smooth transition of the new fleet into service for our people and customers when the time comes,” said Jason Dale, KiwiRail Chief Financial Officer. The service has also experienced breakdowns, reports of poor maintenance, and management issues. In 2023 regulators said they would prosecute the company over maintenance issues which caused one of the vessels to black out during its crossing. In 2024, another one of the ferries went aground departing port with the investigation saying the crew did not know how to turn off the autopilot. This week, the company began its plan by officially retiring the Aratere after its final sailing on August 18, a three-hour crossing between Picton and Wellington. The retirement of the vessel, which had been commissioned in 1999, is designed to permit the development of new port infrastructure. Aratere was the company’s only rail-enabled ferry, meaning freight cars were moved to the vessel and across the Cook Strait. Aratere’s wharf in Picton is due to be demolished later this year as part of the new ferry project. Aratere required specialized wharf infrastructure to load and unload, including integrated rail tracks, so it cannot use Interislander’s other berths. Until the new ferries are delivered, freight will have to be transferred into trailers and trucks for the trip between the islands. The ferry was laid up in Wellington with KiwiRail reporting it is considering options for its sale with a shipbroker. It says the plans for the new ferries are on schedule. Due for delivery by 2029, they will be larger, replacing all three current ships, and will reintroduce rail freight capabilities to the route.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Australia Investigating After Bulker Blacks Out and Drifts Toward Newcastle,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australia-investigating-after-bulker-blacks-out-and-drifts-toward-newcastle,,22/08/2025 19:49:45,,"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the circumstances around an incident where a larger bulker lost power and drifted dangerously close to Newcastle. It will be looking for critical safety issues, and if they are identified, the ATSB will immediately notify the operators of the ship and the port, and other relevant parties, so that appropriate and timely safety action can be taken. The incident began on the morning of July 30 when the Marshall Island-registered bulker Basic Victory was holding offshore awaiting its berth. Newcastle is one of the busiest ports in Australia, reporting that it handles over 4,400 ship movements each year. Over 152 million tonnes of cargo are handled annually at the port. The bulker, which was built in the Philippines in 2021, was about 20 miles off the Port of Newcastle while waiting to berth when it reported around 8:00 a.m. local time that its main engine had failed. The ship was drifting towards the coastline north of Newcastle and by about 1730 that afternoon had closed to within three miles of the nearest land. The ship’s master reported the propulsion failure to Newcastle vessel traffic service and, as they were drifting close to shore, requested permission to anchor. Shortly afterward, the crew succeeded in restarting the main engine and the ship steamed clear of the coastline. After the ship had berthed in Newcastle on August 7, ATSB reports its investigators boarded the ship for an inspection and to collect evidence, including interviewing the master and crewmembers. They also obtained recorded data and documentary evidence. After repairs were completed, the Basic Victory sailed from Australia on August 9. The vessel is at sea bound for Japan, where it is due to arrive next week. Australia has a reputation for its enforcement of safety regulations and detailed inspections of ships. The Australian Maritime Safety Administration has administered bans on ships that are repeat violators or have failed to undertake proper repairs and maintenance.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
U.S. Deports More Cruise Ship Crewmembers as Visa Review Expands,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-deports-more-cruise-ship-crewmembers-as-visa-review-expands,,22/08/2025 19:09:19,,"Advocates for the Philippine community report that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is continuing its enforcement efforts, rapidly deporting individual crewmembers off cruise ships that it says have violated their work visas. This comes as the Trump administration confirmed on Thursday, August 21, that it was expanding its review of all current U.S. visas and specifically suspending work visas for foreigners as commercial truck drivers. The Pilipino Workers Center (PWC) reports CBP officers once again met the Carnival Cruise Line ship Carnival Sunshine last Sunday, August 17, when the ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia, from its weekly cruise. Four Filipino crewmembers out of a crew of over 1,000 people were reportedly taken into custody, removed from the ship, placed in a hotel under guard overnight, and flown out of the United States the following day. The advocacy groups contend that the crewmembers are being “fast-tracked” for deportation with no legal process. They said no evidence, no charges, and no hearings are being conducted. Instead, the crewmembers are told they must sign deportation paperwork or face the potential of a $250,000 fine or jail time. As part of the deportation, they are also barred from returning to the United States for 10 years. The group reports the four crewmembers taken into custody on Sunday were told they were being targeted because they participated in an online chat group that had links to child pornography. No evidence was presented, and the group says all four individuals denied the allegations. The groups report that 28 crewmembers from the Carnival Sunshine have now been removed from the ship and deported since the crackdown began this spring. Over 100 crewmembers from various cruise ships around the United States, all holders of valid crew visas for work on commercial vessels, have been deported. CBP confirmed the actions to 13News Now in Virginia, saying that the individuals were “found inadmissible and were denied entry into the United States,” as part of “ongoing cruise vessel operations” where immigration law is being enforced. The Pilipino Workers Center reports it is speaking with the Philippine government about the matter. The U.S. State Department confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing what it said are 55 million U.S. visas, looking for any violations that could lead to deportation. Associated Press noted there are 12.8 million foreigners with residency papers known as a “Green Card” and an additional 3.6 million people in the U.S. on visas. It believes the remainder of the 55 million figure is outstanding multi-entry visas where the people are not currently in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted online that as part of the review, his department was suspending visas for commercial truck drivers. He wrote that foreigners operating large tractor-trailer trucks endanger American lines and undercut American truck drivers. The Trump administration has already increased rules to ensure English language competency for commercial truck drivers. A portion of the drivers now being targeted are the ones who move containers from the U.S. ports and around the country. Advocates highlight an existing shortage of drivers and the potential to further impact supply chain operations.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau Consortium Improves Thruster Performance,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/meyer-fassmer-spezialschiffbau-consortium-improves-thruster-performance,,22/08/2025 18:19:55,,"[By: Elomatic] Elomatic, an international consulting and engineering company, has successfully completed the installation of its patented ElogridTM tunnel thruster technology on the 10,000 GT special purpose research vessel, the METEOR IV, built by the MEYER FASSMER spezialchiffbau consortium. As part of a joint venture between FASSMER and MEYER Group, the 125-meter research vessel is being constructed for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), to support their worldwide multifunctional and interdisciplinary projects, with a focus on climate and environmental research within the Atlantic. This contract marks another milestone in the adoption of Elomatic’s Elogrid tunnel thruster solution as it continues to be selected as part of innovative newbuild projects, engaging the versatility of Elomatic competences. All previously installed applications were as part of retrofit projects on existing vessels to provide immediate benefits in fuel consumption reduction and thrust increase. For the METEOR IV project, the thrust increase was the main objective, which is why MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau selected the Elogrid solution, to improve the vessel’s dynamic positioning capability to support their mission profile, while also reducing fuel consumption. Elogrid is an energy saving technology which is designed to maximize side thrust force to enhance maneuverability, whilst unlocking new levels of performance, efficiency, and sustainability. The Elogrid technology is predicted to reduce fuel consumption ranging from 1% to 4% per vessel in normal operating conditions. It achieves this by reducing flow entry into the bow thruster tunnels at cruising speeds. Elogrid blades are designed to improve side thrust when tunnel propellers are in use, resulting in a 5-8% increase in side thrust compared to operation without grids. Jari Yli-Tolppa, Vice President Shipowner Services, said: “Our collaboration with MEYER FASSMER Spezialschiffbau marks a significant step forward in the development of the Elogrid solution. The METEOR IV project is a prime example of how the Elogrid solution can be incorporated into the initial design phase of a vessel, establishing a blueprint for future new build projects, to support ship owners that are looking to improve their vessel’s performance, increase efficiencies, as well as reduce their carbon footprint.” Jan Oskar Henkel, Managing Director, FASSMER, said: “Our collaboration with Elomatic allows us to meet the specific performance requirements for the METEOR IV’s dynamic positioning capability. The Elogrid technology enhances the vessel’s performance while contributing to efficient operations.”",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Royal Navy Tracks Russian Destroyer Through the English Channel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/royal-navy-tracks-russian-destroyer-through-the-english-channel,,22/08/2025 06:21:54,,"The Royal Navy has tracked a Russian destroyer and two accompanying vessels through the English Channel, its latest mission to keep an eye on Russia's frequent naval movements in British waters. The mission began when patrol ship HMS Trent picked up the trail of the Russian destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov off Great Yarmouth. On August 10, Trent was seen following Kulakov westbound through the English Channel, bracketed by a steady stream of ""shadow fleet"" tankers. Ship spotter Dover Strait Shipping identified more than a dozen Russia-linked tankers passing through during a 24-hour time period around Kulakov's transit. Clockwise from upper left: Skobelev, Sparta, Vice Admiral Kulakov, HMS Trent (Royal Navy) Kulakov continued onward to waters off Ushant, where the destroyer met up with the Russian military ro/ro cargo ship Sparta, a well-known and heavily-sanctioned vessel. AIS data suggests that Sparta was on a return voyage from the former Russian naval base at Tartus, where Russian forces have been demobilizing equipment. The tanker General Skobelev - often used by Russian forces as a fleet oiler - was sailing with Sparta and joined the convoy. Together, they turned and headed eastbound to go back through the channel. After a brief pause in Lyme Bay, off Britain's southern coast, they made the transit into the North Sea, then north to the Kattegat and into the Baltic. Sparta (green) and General Skobelev (red) on the long voyage from the Eastern Mediterranean to the Baltic (Pole Star) HMS Trent followed Kulakov throughout the round-trip voyage through the English Channel, according to the Royal Navy, as is standard practice when Russian warships transit UK waters. Vice Admiral Kulakov is an Udaloy-class antisubmarine warfare destroyer, built to challenge the U.S. Navy's sub fleet in the late years of the Cold War. She was commissioned in 1981, entered a refit period in 1991, and returned to active duty 19 years later. A dedicated antisubmarine warfare platform, Kulakov carries a missile-launched torpedo system as her primary weapon, not a purpose-built anti-ship missile system.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Semi-Autonomous Barge Spills Fuel on Belgium's Albert Canal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/semi-autonomous-barge-spills-fuel-on-belgium-s-albert-canal,,22/08/2025 04:45:00,,"A semi-autonomous barge has spilled fuel oil into a canal near Antwerp, prompting a cleanup operation and temporarily shutting down marine traffic on the waterway. On Tuesday evening, the barge River Drone 4 passed through the Olen lock complex on the Albert Canal. Soon after, it began to leak fuel, and it released an estimated 10,000 liters into the water before the leak stopped. Antwerp's municipal water utility draws drinking water from the canal, downstream of the spill site, and the city's mayor told Belgian broadcaster VRT that the damage from fuel contamination in the water system would be ""incalculable."" Luckily, the Olen lock complex was between the spill and the city, and there was no risk of transfer across the lock (so long as it remained out of operation). The waterway was closed, both to enable cleanup and to keep the lock complex shut. A marine services company responded to the scene and began removing the fuel slick, first by containing it and then by absorbing it with sorbent booms. Work proceeded through the night, and marine traffic resumed at 1400 hours on Wednesday. The Mars Food factory in Olen - which makes prepackaged rice for the Ben's Original label - temporarily shut down production because of the strong fumes from the spill. ""To protect our employees and products from the odor, we preemptively halted all production,"" spokesperson Kathy Heungens of Mars Food told VRT. The vessel itself reportedly sustained a puncture in a fuel tank above the waterline while transiting the Olen lock, Mayor Gebruers told HLN, and it should be easily repaired. The circumstances of the leak are under investigation, and the master of the barge has been questioned by Belgian authorities. River Drone 4 is a 3,800-tonne inland barge with semi-autonomous capability, according to operator Naval Inland Navigation. Naval's fleet is fitted for remotely controlled navigation with the use of SEAFAR technology, a system that allows an offboard crew to operate the vessel from a shore control center. It is not yet established whether the vessel was being operated by an onboard master or an offboard control operator at the time of the spill. Last December, sister vessel River Drone 5 had a collision with another inland vessel near Rotterdam. At the time of that collision, River Drone 5 was under the control of the onboard master, not Seafar's navigation system.

Le Groupe ALMACO Secures Contract to Outfit Canada’s Polar Max Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/le-groupe-almaco-secures-contract-to-outfit-canada-s-polar-max-icebreaker,,22/08/2025 03:53:57,,"[By: Le Groupe ALMACO] Le Groupe ALMACO, a proudly Canadian subsidiary of ALMACO Group, today announced it has signed a $105M Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract with Chantier Davie Canada Inc. (Davie), Canada's premier shipbuilder, for the outfitting of the Polar Max Icebreaker – a flagship project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS) and a cornerstone of the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) future fleet. The move supports Le Groupe ALMACO and Davie's shared vision of building local capabilities and fostering long-term industrial growth in the Canadian marine sector. Polar Max: a Unique Project Executed Across Continents The execution plan for Polar Max is a truly international collaboration between Davie and ALMACO, spanning both Canada and Finland. The hull will be constructed at Davie-owned Helsinki Shipyard, with Le Groupe ALMACO delivering interior accommodation spaces and other essential areas during this stage. In parallel, in Québec, Davie's skilled shipbuilders and Le Groupe ALMACO will lead the design, procurement, and fabrication of the 1,400-ton superstructure – the top part of the ship. This dual-build approach not only leverages expertise across two continents but also accelerates the project timeline by allowing major work to proceed simultaneously in both locations and guarantee the timely delivery of the ship to the Government of Canada. Once the hull is transported from Finland to Canada, the superstructure will be integrated at Davie's facility in Lévis, Québec. This approach follows a proven process, successfully used for the delivery of Combat Support Ship (CSS) Asterix to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Work on the superstructure begins in late summer, with final integration and vessel delivery to Canada by 2030. Expanding ALMACO Group's Presence in Québec To support the Polar Max project and to create a long-term presence, ALMACO is expanding its operations in Canada. ALMACO set up operations in Québec already in 2022 and will open a new Le Groupe ALMACO office in Québec City in September 2025. Québec's role in the Polar Max program further reinforces its position as a global shipbuilding hub, recognized for innovation, technical excellence, and a highly skilled workforce. In delivering the project, Davie and ALMACO intend to collaborate extensively with subcontractors across Québec and Canada's broader shipbuilding industry, ensuring that expertise and economic benefits are shared nationwide. As part of this effort, ALMACO's role in the Polar Max will generate new jobs in Québec, creating opportunities for local talent and driving long-term growth in the province's advanced marine sector. The company has launched a major recruitment program, combining the know-how of ALMACO's Europe-based employees with the skills of Canadian professionals. Le Groupe ALMACO is committed to employing local talent in all functions – from engineering and project management to manufacturing and other roles. A Shared Commitment to Canada's Maritime Future ""Working with Davie again is a proud moment for us,"" said Vilhelm Roberts, Executive Chairman of the Board and Co-owner of ALMACO Group. ""We've maintained a close relationship with their team ever since the Asterix Project, and this new contract confirms our shared ambition to deliver world-class vessels while growing local expertise and capacity. We're not just outfitting a ship—we're helping to build the future of Canadian shipbuilding together."" ""Polar Max is a once-in-a-generation project that demands the very best from every partner involved, said Davie co-owner and CEO, James Davies. ""Our work with ALMACO on Asterix proved that when we combine their world-class expertise with Canadian ingenuity, we deliver faster, better and with greater impact. This is a lasting partnership which will not only help deliver Polar Max on time and to the highest standard – it will also create jobs and develop skills and industrial capability here in Canada."" Davie is a key player in Canada's National Shipbuilding Strategy. ALMACO is honoured to support this important national initiative and looks forward to continuing its collaboration with Davie on Polar Max, and beyond. ""This is great news that ALMACO has chosen Québec to expand its activities and partner with Davie on the Polar Max Icebreaker project. The National Shipbuilding Strategy continues to generate exciting opportunities for Canada's shipbuilding industry, creating high-value jobs and strengthening our economy while advancing shipbuilding expertise in Québec and across the country,"" said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Québec Regions. ""The Polar Max project is an excellent example of how Canadian industry and international partners can collaborate to deliver world-class capabilities while creating good-paying jobs here at home. With ALMACO expanding its footprint in Québec, we can expect more skilled jobs, greater shipbuilding expertise, and a stronger, more resilient Canadian marine sector. As a key project under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, the Polar Max icebreaker will contribute to a more modern, capable Canadian Coast Guard fleet and secure long-term economic growth and shipbuilding capacity for our country,"" said the Honourable Stephen Fuhr, Secretary of State for Defence Procurement, Canada. ""Davie's leadership in the Polar Max project is a powerful driver of economic growth for Québec,"" said Christopher Skeete, Minister for the Economy. ""The collaboration between Davie and the ALMACO Group will generate business opportunities in both jurisdictions' naval sectors. It will also consolidate Québec's position as a shipbuilding hub, while recognizing the strategic importance placed on the Arctic in the 21st century."" A Trusted Partnership Renewed The Polar Max project represents a significant milestone in the long-standing collaboration between Davie and ALMACO Group.

U.S. and UK Each Launch Sanctions on Facilitators of Iranian Oil Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-and-uk-each-launch-sanctions-on-facilitators-of-iranian-oil-trade,,22/08/2025 03:33:36,,"On the same day, the United States and the United Kingdom each announced moves sanctioning more facilitators of the Iranian oil trade. Both countries highlighted in their independent statements that Iran continues its actions across the Middle East and uses the oil trade to fund its efforts and supports its proxies. In a rare concurrent move by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, they are targeting international facilitators of the trade. Under the new Trump administration, the U.S. has sought to extend its efforts from directly in Iran to those facilitating the trade internationally. While the administration has not yet used its favored weapon of tariffs, it is increasingly sanctioning Chinese entities for their involvement in the trade, as well as tanker operators and networks involved in the sale and distribution of Iranian oil. The State Department launched its fourth round of sanctions targeting China-based terminal operators. Previous rounds targeted so-called teapot refineries, smaller independent operators in China. In today’s announcement, State says it is “taking more aggressive action to stem the flow of revenue” that Iran uses to support terrorism. It says China’s terminals are facilitating the import of millions of barrels of Iranian-origin oil onboard U.S.-designated tankers. One of the sanctioned operators is in the Dongjiakou Port area of Shandong Province (Qingdao Port Haiye Dongjiakou Oil Products Co./DJK Oil Products), which State says operates multiple crude oil and product berths as well as storage facilities. The company is reported to have imported at least 65 million barrels of Iranian-origin oil by numerous show vessels since December 2024. Yangshan Shengang International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., a China-based crude oil terminal and storage operator in the Yangshan Port Area of China’s Zhejiang Province, is also being sanctioned. The U.S. cites at least six shipments of Iranian oil totaling over four million barrels. The terminal is also linked to port calls by sanctioned tankers. The Treasury Department is imposing sanctions on a Greek national, Antonios Margaritis, and his network of companies. The U.S. contends Margaritis’s shipping network has facilitated the transport of Iranian oil and petroleum products for many years. As part of its actions, Treasury is also listing nearly a dozen vessels linked to Margaritis’ network, as well as others from operators ranging from the UAE to Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands. The UK also announced today, August 21, that it was following the U.S. and the EU, which have already sanctioned Hossein Shamkhani, the son of a top political advisor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The U.S. in July mapped out an elaborate network run by Shamkhani, facilitating oil trading for Iran and Russia and leveraging his father’s political ties. The EU also added Shamkhani as the director of UAE-based Admiral Shipping to its list of sanctions. The UK added Shamkhani, citing his network as supporting Iran’s efforts in the Middle East. With this addition, the UK highlighted that it has sanctioned more than 450 Iranian individuals and entities in response to the regime's human rights violations, nuclear weapons program, and its influence and support of proxy networks.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Turkey Bars Ships with Ties to Israel and Suspends All Trade,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-turkey-bars-ships-with-ties-to-israel-and-suspends-all-trade,,22/08/2025 02:34:25,,"The Turkish government has reportedly taken steps to suspend trade with Israel and stop the movement of ships between the two countries, as well as possibly international shipping with an Israeli connection. The full extent of the moves is unclear pending official government statements, but it comes after the Houthis made it clear they were tracking shipping between the countries. Officially, Turkey said it had suspended trade with Israel more than a year ago in May 2024, but both reports from Bloomberg and Reuters have tracked ongoing trade. Turkish ships have also been used to transport aid to the residents of Gaza (one is currently holding off the coast of Israel), and international shipping has made port calls between the two countries. The Trade Ministry of Turkey told Reuters today, August 21, that it was moving to restrict exports on a wide range of products until a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. This is said to include building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment. Turkey has been a leading supplier of construction materials to Israel, with the Bank of Israel reporting more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 move, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes. Other reports today have indicated that the Turkish government is also quietly imposing restrictions on all shipping to Israel. Turkish media and Reuters were reporting without an official announcement, Turkey is beginning to impose a ban on any direct ship traffic between the two countries. The report said the instructions were being delivered verbally by the port authorities to agents and other representatives of the shipping companies. Ships registered in Turkey are reportedly being told they can no longer call in Israeli ports. Israeli shipping companies are told their vessels are barred from Turkey’s ports. Globes and Reuters, however, are suggesting the ban is more comprehensive. Their reports cite unnamed sources that say Turkish authorities are also asking for statements confirming ships are not linked to Israel or engaged in operations linked to Israel. They are also saying that transportation of military or hazardous cargoes to Israel is banned. It is believed the effort will also forbid the handling of any cargo or transshipment of cargo through Turkey to Israel. At the beginning of August, the Houthi militants in Yemen increased their threats against ships and shipping companies calling in Israeli ports. As part of it, they cited the tracks of ships sailing between Israeli ports and Turkey as well as Egypt, warning that it was a violation of the group’s “embargo” on Israeli ports. Turkey’s new move comes after repeated protests in multiple countries, primarily in the Mediterranean region, over the handling of cargo to Israel. Multiple ships have been targeted with accusations that they were carrying military equipment and materials to support the Israeli war effort. Shipping companies with U.S. government contracts to transport materials have also been accused of aiding the war effort. The protests have also grown to include an Israeli-owned cruise ship carrying tourists to ports in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regularly monitors Chinese movements at Scarborough Shoal, which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. Philippine fishermen maintain a presence at the reef, supported by regular government resupply missions, and the China Coast Guard routinely attempts to curtail or harass their operations. According to the AFP, China Coast Guard small boats at Scarborough have now been fitted with crew-served weapons, a development not previously seen in the area. The up-gunned small craft are a concerning development for the AFP: China Coast Guard boarding teams used similarly-equipped fast boats during the armed attack at Second Thomas Shoal last year, a violent altercation which resulted in one Philippine marine losing a finger. The AFP patrol spotted five China Coast Guard vessels at Scarborough, along with 11 fast boats and two Chinese aircraft. Some of the CCG cutters were observed practicing the use of their water cannons, which have been used in the past to intimidate or damage Philippine vessels. AFP Monitoring Reveals Increased Chinese Movements in Ayungin ShoalThrough its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) monitoring, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has observed an increase in the presence of Chinese vessels in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal on August 20.China... pic.twitter.com/Ad55gg7DDT Scarborough Shoal has been a flash point in the territorial conflict between China and the Philippines for more than a decade, but the intensity of the confrontation has been heating up. On August 11, while chasing a pair of Philippine Coast Guard cutters around Scarborough, a Chinese PLA Navy warship cut across the bow of a China Coast Guard cutter at high speed, initiating a collision that damaged the Chinese cutter and generated embarrassing press coverage. Two days later, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Higgins sailed past Scarborough on August 13, challenging China's claims of control and drawing stern protests that the passage had “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security."" China claims most of the Philippines' western exclusive economic zone as Chinese sovereign territory, even though it is located hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland. Beijing bases its claim on a historical map feature from the 1940s, the ""nine-dash line,"" which purports to show Chinese control over the majority of the South China Sea. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague invalidated these historical claims in 2016, but China has ignored the ruling.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Saturation Diving Begins Effort to Remove Fuel from MSC Elsa 3 Casualty,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saturation-diving-begins-effort-to-remove-fuel-from-msc-elsa-3-casualty,,22/08/2025 01:05:19,,"Salvage efforts at the wreck site of the casualty MSC Elsa 3 have moved into a critical phase, reports India’s Directorate General of Shipping. Starting on August 20, saturation diving began on the hulk as the salvage team hired by MSC and the insurers started the efforts to pump the remaining fuel from the vessel. It is a challenging operation because of the depth of the wreck, which lies at approximately 51 meters (167 feet), and the potential for adverse weather conditions. The operations were suspended in July after the first phase capped vents and ports that were thought to be weeping small amounts of fuel. The site, which is 14 nautical miles off the Indian state of Kerala on the West Coast, is exposed to the seasonal monsoons. The salvage plan submitted by SMIT Salvage, the firm engaged by the shipowners and the Protection and Indemnity insurer North Standard, targets completion of the fuel extraction by September 25. SMIT was hired as a specialist for this phase of the effort, replacing the earlier salvage firm. They note the schedule is a tentative timeline for oil removal and associated activities, which may be impacted by weather conditions. Estimates are that there was a total of 450 metric tons of fuel aboard the containership when it went down on May 25. It consists of approximately 85 tons of diesel, and the remainder is VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil). Since the vessel sank, there have been small quantities of fuel on the surface, which have dissipated in the sea conditions. The Directorate General is advising local fishermen and other vessels not to enter a one-nautical-mile exclusion zone around the operation. It is being supported by Diving Support Vessels and other crafts to ensure the safety and monitor for pollution. In addition to the fuel removal, the DGS reports that so far, 655 tons of plastic nurdles have been collected from the coastal areas. There was a total of 650 containers aboard, of which the DGS says 66 have been recovered after washing up on the coast along with various other debris. Sri Lanka, which is hundreds of miles away, reports debris has also washed up on its shores. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the owners of the vessel, and the insurance companies continue to face a growing list of legal challenges associated with the casualty. The company has moved to limit its liability while rejecting the extent of the damage claims made by Kerala in court. The court has detained five MSC containerships while they were making port calls in India as security against various claims by fishermen and shippers who had cargo on the ship. Four of the vessels have been released after bonds were posted, but the MSC Akiteta II has been stuck in port for a month as it was attached as part of the $1 billion claim made by Kerala. The company told the court that India is threatening trade and its supply chain. It said the terms in the case are setting a bad precedent that shipping companies would not be able to meet. Sri Lanka has filed separate claims for the impact on its environment from the wreck.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Ship With Critical Aid From Cyprus for Gaza is Holding 48 Hours Offshore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ship-with-critical-aid-from-cyprus-for-gaza-is-holding-48-hours-offshore,,22/08/2025 00:14:34,,"The latest effort to get a meaningful amount of aid into Gaza for residents is underway, but appears to have been slowed as the vessel is circling off the coast near the port of Ashdod, Israel. The ship had been scheduled to dock on Tuesday night, August 19, but as of Thursday night continues to sail in circles. The Republic of Cyprus took a leading role in organizing the aid shipment. It contributed over 700 tons of food and material, along with 500 tons from the Government of Malta. Humanitarian organizations from the United States, Italy, Malta, and Kuwait have also participated, and the Government of the United Arab Emirates was reported to be instrumental in the entire effort. The vessel, Henke, a 5,000-dwt general cargo ship registered in Panama, was loaded at the port of Lemesos, Cyprus, for departure on Monday, August 18. The ship, which is Turkish-owned and managed, has a spotty record, including 16 deficiencies identified during a Port State inspection in May, which caused it to be detained for eight days, but it is providing a vital lifeline to the residents of Gaza. The ship is loaded with a total of 52 containers holding 1,200 tons of relief aid. Among the supplies provided are pasta, rice, baby food, canned goods, and other vital supplies, which are to be handed over to the charitable organization World Central Kitchen as the final contractor and distributor. The effort is underway under the auspices of the United Nations delivery mechanism, reports Cyprus. Η Κυπριακ? Δημοκρατ?α συνεχ?ζει την ?μπρακτη δρ?ση στο ανθρωπιστικ? πεδ?ο.

Associated Press reports Israeli customs officials screened the shipment before it left Lemesos. Cyprus said the agreement calls for the cargo to be transferred via the Port of Ashdod without additional security checks at the point of arrival. It is unclear, however, what the delay is for the vessel, which was to have begun offloading on Wednesday, August 20, according to the announced schedule. AIS signals show the vessel underway at 5 knots circling off the northern Israeli coast. It is not the first time Cyprus has served as a staging point to send aid to the citizens of Gaza. The United States used Cyprus in its failed effort at setting up a floating harbor for Gaza. The World Central Kitchen organized a barge loaded with aid that was also towed from Cyprus in 2024. This latest effort comes as the ceasefire talks and proposals for the release of the remaining Israeli hostages teeter back and forth. Israel has announced its plans to intensify its efforts in the remaining sections of Gaza while also calling for the immediate release of all hostages. It is believed that Hamas is still holding as many as 50 Israelis, although the Israeli government has said it believes between 25 and 35 of them are likely deceased. Hamas alleges that as many as 62,000 Gazans have been killed in the 22-month war. The need to get food and water to the residents of Gaza is acute, with the UN calling this mission a crucial step.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Navy Fighter Pilot Rescued From the Sea Off Virginia,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/navy-fighter-pilot-rescued-from-the-sea-off-virginia,,21/08/2025 23:56:54,,"On Wednesday morning, a U.S. Navy strike fighter went down during a routine training flight off the coast of Virginia, and the pilot was rescued from the sea after spending about an hour in the water. A Navy spokesperson confirmed that an F/A-18 Super Hornet from Virginia Beach-based Strike Fighter Squadron 83 was operating off the coast that morning, and at about 0950 hours, the pilot had to eject. The pilot survived, went into the water, and was found by Coast Guard SAR crews at 1121 hours. The rescuee was delivered to a hospital for a medical evaluation; the Navy has not provided further details on the pilot's condition. Given the rough surface conditions caused by Hurricane Erin in the mid-Atlantic, the pilot could have faced serious danger - and a challenging SAR scenario - if the timing or location had been different. The wreck of the aircraft remains on the bottom, the Navy said. The service often recovers downed fighters from the seabed in order to investigate crashes and deter espionage. It is the fourth Super Hornet that the Navy has lost since December. Three fighters assigned to the carrier USS Harry S. Truman were lost due to accidental causes during the Red Sea campaign in late 2023 and early 2024. At $67 million per unit, the Super Hornet is about 30 percent less expensive than the stealthy F-35C; the Hornet's heavy payload and long range make it the mainstay of the service's carrier strike capabilities. The platform is older and non-stealth, but the Navy expects to keep it for decades, and it ordered 17 more Super Hornets in 2024 to offset attrition in the fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Chinese-Born U.S. Navy Sailor Convicted of Selling Secrets,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-born-u-s-navy-sailor-convicted-of-selling-secrets-to-china,,21/08/2025 23:11:30,,"On Wednesday, a court in California convicted a U.S. Navy sailor on charges of selling military secrets to China at a bargain price. Machinist's Mate 3rd Class Jinchao ""Patrick"" Wei was assigned to the amphib USS Essex at Naval Station San Diego. In February 2022, according to DOJ, Wei began working with a Chinese intelligence officer who information about Essex's systems, among other sensitive information. Wei sent him photos and videos of the ship, plus 60 technical manuals for Essex's weapons control systems, propulsion, steering system, elevators and casualty control systems. Wei also ""disclosed what he believed to be a weak point of the USS Essex,"" according to prosecutors. Wei was born in China, and at the time the offenses began, he was not an American citizen (though he applied for and gained U.S. citizenship during the course of the plot). Prosecutors said that Wei's mother told him to spy for Chinese intelligence so that he would be able to get a future job with the Chinese Communist Party, a coveted career path in China. The near-term financial incentives were slim: for committing serious federal crimes, Wei was paid only $12,000 in total. Wei was arrested in 2023 and charged with delivering defense information to a foreign government and exporting defense articles without a license, along with related charges. He was held without bail as a serious flight risk, since he was a Chinese citizen and his handler had previously offered to fly him out of the country. Over the course of the past week, a federal jury heard his case and convicted him on six counts. He faces sentencing on December 1. “The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money.""

"Captain of Eagle S Says Dragging Anchor, Cable Damage was Accident",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/captain-of-eagle-s-says-dragging-anchor-cable-damage-was-accident,,21/08/2025 22:36:35,,"The week before the trial is due to begin in Helsinki, Finland, over the damage to five subsea power and communication cables, Swedish public broadcaster Yle has released an interview with the captain of the tanker Eagle S. The broadcaster posted excerpts online (in English) during which the captain defends the ship’s actions and called the incident a “marine accident.” A Georgian national, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, along with the first and second officers (Indian nationals) of the tanker Eagle S, are due to go on trial in the Helsinki District Court on Monday, August 25, after having been banned from leaving Finland since the incident which took place on December 25, 2024. The most serious charges are aggravated sabotage and aggravated communications interference for the power and communications cables, as well as lesser counts of criminal mischief, vandalism, and endangering public safety. The captain told the interviewer that the Finns tracked his ship and had information that they were possibly dragging their anchor. He says they could have called his ship, telling him to check the anchor. He highlights that it would have taken 5 to 7 minutes to bring the laden 74,000 dwt tanker to a stop. Asked why the crew did not detect that the anchor was dragging, he responds that no alarms went off on the bridge. He says the autopilot did not alert them that the vessel was heeling or changing course. They did not detect increasing vibration, impacts, or bouncing movement, and did not hear abnormal noises. He contends that an examination of the anchor windlass does not show dents or distortions or traces of soot, which would normally be the case if there had been an uncontrolled release of the anchor. He does not explain when or how the anchor was lowered. The captain confirms the vessel lost speed but cites high winds and increased waves that afternoon. He also says the chief engineer reported problems with the engine. Captain contends 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard ""like they catch some terrorists or something"" (Finnish Border Guard) When the Coast Guard vessel Turva made contact that evening, it told the crew of the Eagle S that its port anchor chain was out. The captain reports a bad feeling when they pulled the chain up and discovered the anchor was missing. He says he complied with the demands of the Turva to steer into Finnish waters, although he knew they lacked authority since the ship was in international waters. He says his concern was for the safety of the crew, his vessel, and the cargo. Vadatchkoria says he thought there would be an orderly boarding, but instead alleges the helicopter boarding was a “breach of maritime safety.” He says the troops dropping from the helicopter were not experienced and notes there are normally strict rules to prevent static electricity that could cause sparks on the deck of a tanker, especially his, which was laden with gasoline and diesel fuel. He says 60 or 70 armed soldiers or police came aboard “like they catch some terrorists or something.” The captain further claims the Finns later threatened him at gunpoint to move the tanker to a closer anchorage for a port state inspection. He says the crew was sleeping on the floor of the mess and was individually integrated. Electronic devices, computers, cameras, and phones were confiscated from the Eagle S. The reports that there was “Russian espionage equipment” aboard are strongly denied. Yle reports prosecutors have found no evidence pointing to a conspiracy, but continue to allege intention and say the dragging was deliberate. Lawyers for the captain and two officers have asserted that Finland does not have legal authority to prosecute since the incident took place in international waters. It will be the first issue the court will address when it convenes next week. The captain told Yle they are innocent and he has trust in the Finnish court.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Italian Police Arrest Ukrainian Suspect in Nord Stream Sabotage Case,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-police-arrest-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case,,21/08/2025 22:25:20,,"Police in Italy have arrested a Ukrainian man who is suspected of involvement in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline system. In September 2022, subsea blasts breached three out of the four parallel gas lines in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 systems, resulting in the largest manmade methane release in history. These giant lines were installed on the seabed of the Baltic to transport gas from Russian state producer Gazprom to customers in Germany, providing German industry with low-cost energy. German, Swedish and Danish investigators have all confirmed that the explosions were an act of sabotage. The German inquiry into the cause of the blast continued for years, starting with the examination of a Ukrainian-chartered yacht operating out of Rostock. In June 2024, German officials issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian professional diver, identified only as Volodymyr Z. The suspect was believed to be in Poland, but departed before he could be arrested, according to prosecutors in Warsaw. The suspect, in a phone interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, denied that he was aware of the plot or the warrant. On Thursday, Germany's federal prosecutor general said that Italian police have detained another Ukrainian suspect who is alleged to have participated in the attack. The individual, identified only as Serhii K., was arrested in Rimini, a resort destination on the Adriatic coast. The man faces charges of anti-constitutional sabotage, destroying infrastructure and causing an explosion, and will have to be extradited to Germany to stand trial - a process that may take time. Ukraine's government has consistently denied any involvement in or knowledge of a plot to blow up the Nord Stream pipelines. In the past, Ukraine has accused Russia of sabotaging Nord Stream 1 and 2 in order to cause disruption, even though Russia stands to gain from Nord Stream's operation if the lines are ever restarted.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Pictures from the site show the 106-meter (348-foot) vessel’s bow and forward section protruding from the water. The Hellenic Coast Guard termed it a “vertical sinking to the starboard side,” reporting the vessel went under during the morning hours of August 19. Salvage operations had been underway for most of the month after the vessel grounded on July 24, approximately 3 nautical miles west of the northeastern tip of Crete. The vessel had loaded a cargo of gypsum in the port of Sitia on Crete and departed that evening bound for Lebanon. Built in 1994, the vessel was registered in Sierra Leone and had a crew of 14 aboard who were rescued and brought to shore by fishing boats and the port authority. The captain and watch officer of the MN Kostas were being investigated for causing a shipwreck and failing to avoid collisions, which in this case was the reef. The authorities stated that the reef was marked on navigation charts. The forward section of the vessel is protruding out of the water (Hellenic Coast Guard) A local salvage company, Seagate, was retained after the grounding. It reports that 37 tons of diesel fuel were removed along with other potential pollutants, including lubricants and paints. They had also brought in a crane and a second ship and offloaded most of the gypsum cargo before the vessel sank. The Coast Guard reports ventilation and other opening had been sealed during the salvage operation. Earlier this year, the same ship was cited for charges of failing to pay its crew, with the International Labour Organization reporting the crew was due nearly $18,500 in pay. It said the crew had only received half pay for four months, but that the situation was corrected.

Iranian Navy Conducts First Post-War Exercise,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/iranian-navy-conducts-first-post-war-exercise,,21/08/2025 18:48:09,,"Possibly in response to the presence of the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) Carrier Support Group (CSG) in the area, the regular Iranian Navy (Nedaja) has sallied from Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor, and commenced an exercise in the Gulf of Oman on August 21. This is the Nedaja’s first Southern Fleet exercise since the 12-Day War with Israel. Codenamed Exercise Sustainable Power 1404, the exercise is being coordinated by the Nedaja’s 2nd Flotilla, which is headquartered at the new naval harbor at Jask. Some limited additional activity was noted at piers in the Jask naval harbor on August 17. The 2nd Flotilla is commanded by Rear Admiral Abbas Hassani. Planned long-range missile firing outlined by Admiral Hassani on August 19 (Landsat, Copernicus, Google Earth, CJRC) Anti-ship missile firings took place on the first day of the exercise. Alvand Class frigate IRINS Sabalan (F73) fired at least one Qadir anti-ship missile. The Qadir has a range of approximately 125 miles, with a 200kg warhead, a development of the Noor missile first reverse-engineered from the Chinese C-802 missile. IRINS Sabalan completed a refit in November 2024, in which 12 Noor missile boxes were replaced by 16 Qadir launchers. At the time the refit was completed, the Iranian Kayhan website speculated that the Sabalan had also been fitted with 650-mile range Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis anti-ship missiles. A short-range Nasir missile, a derivative of the Chinese C-704, was also fired from the Hendijan Class auxiliary IRINS Ganaveh (A1408) during the first day, and the Velayat-2 coastal defense system was used to ground-launch an anti-ship missile, probably a Qadir. Descriptions of exercise activity published by the Tasnim news agency and others often use illustrative imagery from previous exercises and confuse missile types, so reports and pictorial evidence of firings cannot be relied upon. A picture released by the Tasnim news agency shows a 250-mile range Bavar-5 one-way attack drone being launched from what appears to be a Delvar Class replenishment ship. (CC BY 4.0) In the lead-up to the exercise, Rear Admiral Hassani gave a briefing indicating that a long-range anti-ship missile would be fired from the Gulf of Oman at a target some 1,400 miles away to the west of the Maldive Islands. There are no indications that a Notice to Mariners has been issued, or that the Maldives government has been informed. But such a flight trajectory would take any Iranian missile launched over the sea area where the Nimitz CSG is now believed to be operating. This may be a gesture of defiance on the part of the Nedaja, and it remains to be seen if the Nedaja will actually carry out this intent on the second day of the exercise. E-2D surveillance aircraft from Squadron VAW 12 aboard the Nimitz will no doubt be monitoring the potential threat, and also the positions of the Nedaja vessels which have left Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor but which are not participating directly in the exercise. Exercise Sustainable Power 1404 is likely to conclude on August 22 with some form of long-range missile firing, either of an anti-ship missile or of ballistic missile fired from the deck of an Iranian warship. Iranian ships capable of deck-firing missiles however - Shahid Madhavi (C110-3), Shahid Bagheri (C110-4) and the Nedaja’s IRINS Makran (K441) - remain off Bandar Abbas as of August 20.

He used the occasion of his latest onboard visit to call for ""rapid expansion of nuclearization"" of the country's armed forces, including its naval fleet. During a tour of first-in-class destroyer Choe Hyon on August 18, Kim called ongoing drills by U.S. and South Korean forces a threat to North Korea's security, and claimed that ""the security environment around the DPRK is getting more serious day by day."" He called for doubling down on Pyongyang's nuclear-centric defense strategy, including a transformation of the country's aging naval fleet to make it ""high-tech and nuclear-armed."" ""The Navy will become a reliable force firmly performing a part in the composition of the state nuclear forces and the realm of nuclear use in the near future,"" Kim said in comments paraphrased by state news agencies. Stressing speed, Kim called for the armed forces to ""extremely rapidly develop the capabilities for operations of our Navy."" The new ""destroyers"" are frigate-sized at about 5,000 tonnes, but are heavily armed. They carry a combined 74 VLS cells of various sizes, including large cells for possible ballistic missile armament, plus angle-launch cruise missile racks and (analysts believe) a Pantsir-ME short range air defense system. In form, they appear to be a stretched variant of Russia's Admiral Grigorovich-class frigate, according to Janes analyst Mike Plunkett. If North Korea's claims are correct, the first two hulls were built in just over a year's time, a pace unmatched by advanced shipbuilding nations. The rushed timeline has prompted questions about whether the vessels were even fitted with engines; first-in-class Choe Hyon has not been seen making way under its own power, and appears to be riding unusually high in the water. The vessels are few in number and readily tracked, and Western analysts have questioned their survivability and deterrence value as nuclear launch platforms; but their military capabilities may be secondary to their propaganda mission, according to Khang Vu, a defense scholar at Boston College. ""Big and modern warships confer national leaders with a great sense of achievement. The North Korean chairman will soon enter his 15th year in the top job, and leaving a legacy that can rival those of his father and grandfather is highly important,"" Vu wrote for the Lowy Interpreter. ""Turning the navy from a coastal to a blue-water force was a task neither his father nor grandfather could accomplish. He is using the launch of the destroyers – successful or not – to demonstrate his regime’s ability to innovate and to correct its mistakes."" The second hull in the series is under repair after a failed side-launch sequence, and the third hull is under construction. Nampho Shipyard's workforce has pledged to deliver the third vessel in just 14 months, according to North Korean state media.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Helsinki Shipyard Cuts Steel for Canada's Next Polar Icebreaker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/helsinki-shipyard-cuts-steel-on-canada-s-next-polar-icebreaker,,21/08/2025 04:59:22,,"Chantier Davie's Helsinki Shipyard has cut steel for the Canadian Coast Guard's next polar icebreaker, the future CCGS Imnaryuaq. It is the second of the two different heavy icebreakers that the Canadian government has ordered under the National Shipbuilding Strategy. Heavy icebreakers are unique and challenging vessels, requiring extra-thick hulls, special steel and heavy internal framing to brace the ship against ice pressure. Most icebreakers are built in Finland, and few other nations maintain an industrial base for icebreaker construction. To compete for Canada's business, Chantier Davie bought Helsinki Shipyard from its previous Russian owners, acquiring an experienced Finnish workforce along with tooling and yard capacity. It may not be located in Canada, but Helsinki can build the hull right away, and Chantier Davie can complete fitting-out at its yard in Quebec. ""With construction now underway on the Polar Max icebreaker, the project will progress while developing the skills and expertise of Canadian workers,"" said Canadian secretary of state for defense procurement Stephen Fuhr. ""This international collaboration provides our workers with the opportunity to learn best practices and advanced methods that will strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding industry for years to come."" The Helsinki Shipyard / Davie hull is scheduled for delivery in 2030. The other polar-class hull on order under the NSS, Seaspan's polar icebreaker, has been delayed to make room for other government shipbuilding priorities. Canada's government began initial design work on the project in 2012, and Seaspan cut first steel earlier this year. It is scheduled to deliver in 2032, two years after Davie's Finnish/Canadian hull. Canada's heavy icebreaker procurement program is an expensive venture. By comparison, the latest independent estimate for the U.S. Coast Guard's heavy icebreaker program puts the all-in unit cost at about US$1.7 billion per hull, about 175 percent over the original contract price agreed by Halter Marine. The Canadian orders cost far more: not including future overruns, Chantier Davie's one-ship program cost US$2.3 billion, and Seaspan's one-ship program cost a combined US$3 billion. Canada's parliamentary budget office estimates that the all-in procurement cost will be just over US$6 billion for the two hulls.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Erin became a Category 1 hurricane last week, and rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm overnight Friday. In jumping from wind speeds of 75 mph to 160 mph in about 24 hours, Erin became one of the fastest-intensifying hurricanes in history. After undergoing an eyewall replacement Sunday, the storm weakened, but its horizontal extent broadened. It is producing waves of about 50 feet high near the center of the storm, and wave heights of 12 feet or more extend 400 nautical miles from the center - a ""very large area of extremely large and hazardous seas,"" according to the National Hurricane Center. Satellite AIS data shows that shipping interests are giving it a wide berth. Wind and wave height forecast for August 20 (NHC TAFB) Shipping traffic off U.S. East Coast, August 20 (Pole Star) The forecast track is expected to keep Erin's high winds far offshore, but storm surge, wave action, rip currents and heavy rains are expected. State and local officials along the eastern seaboard are encouraging the public to stay out of the water until after the hurricane has passed by, and the Coast Guard is repositioning assets to be in place for response needs. Wave and water hazards pose the greatest threat. Storm surge levels in parts of North Carolina could reach two to four feet, creating a risk of coastal flooding. Residents of North Carolina's Outer Banks could end up cut off for days due to inundation of Highway 12, the tenuous road link that connects the barrier island communities. Hatteras and Ocracoke are under evacuation orders, not because of any imminent hazard, but because they may soon become unreachable for first responders. An estimated 2,000 people departed by Wednesday morning. As the storm heads further north, authorities are taking precautionary measures. Public beaches in New Jersey, Delaware and the outer boroughs of New York City are closing down in advance due to the risk of rip currents. Two more tropical systems are in line behind Erin, and NHC is tracking their development. The peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is approaching, and forecasters expect more activity still to come.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"CMB.TECH Completes Merger of Golden Ocean, Creating 250 Ship Fleet",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/merger-of-golden-ocean-into-cmb-tech-approved-and-set-to-close,,21/08/2025 01:10:35,,"After the shareholders of Golden Ocean Group officially ratified the proposed merger, CMB.TECH completed the merger, assuming the operations of the dry bulk carrier into its fleet. The resulting company is an industry giant that further diversifies CMB.TECH’s overall fleet and setting the stage as it continues to push forward with a strategy tied to the energy transformation of the shipping industry. Golden Ocean confirmed that August 19 was the last day of trading for its stock in the United States on NASDAQ and the Euronext Oslo Børs. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding common share of Golden Ocean was exchanged for nearly 96 million newly issued CMB.TECH ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of 0.95 ordinary shares of CMB.TECH for each common share of Golden Ocean. CMB.TECH also launched a listing on the Euronext Oslo Børs, as well as continuing to trade on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Brussels. “Today, we are delighted to close the merger between CMB.TECH and Golden Ocean,” said Alexander Saverys, CEO of CMB.TECH. “In less than 18 months, we have transformed a pure play crude oil tanker company into a large and leading diversified and future-proof maritime group.” Plans for the merger were announced in April with Saverys calling the transaction “another great step forward” in building a diversified maritime group. CMB.TECH, which was formed by the 2024 takeover of Euronav, owns and operates more than 160 seagoing vessels in the crude oil tankers, dry bulk, containership, chemical tanker, offshore wind, and workboat sectors. CMB.TECH’s dry bulk fleet before the merger included 28 Newcastlemax vessels as well as two smaller coasters operating under the Bocimar brand. Saverys said in April, explaining the rationale for the merger, “The value of our fleet would reach more than $11 billion and, combined with our public listings and enhanced liquidity in our shares, we will have all the necessary firepower to continue to invest in our fleet and seize opportunities. Our focus on decarbonization is starting to generate meaningful long-term contracts, and the recent IMO decisions on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from shipping give us even more wind (and ammonia) in our sails.” The combined fleet numbers approximately 250 vessels with Saverys an average age of vessel of just over six years. Dry bulk becomes the largest portion of the group’s operations. The transaction in effect brings Golden Ocean and the bulker fleet full circle 20 years after the company emerged as an independent operator. Originally part of Frontline, Golden Ocean was spun off in 2005 to create a pureplay bulker company separate from Frontline’s tanker operations. The company grew to a leading position in the dry bulk. The Golden Ocean fleet consisted of 89 dry bulk vessels, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 13.5 million deadweight tonnes. The ships are now being reflected as part of CMB.TECH’s Bocimar brand with a combined fleet of 119 ships. Analysts have speculated that a portion of the dry bulk fleet might be sold now that the merger is completed.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Video Shows Rare Drone-on-Drone Boat Collision off California,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-video-shows-rare-drone-on-drone-boat-collision-off-california,,21/08/2025 00:42:34,,"Reuters has released video footage of a collision between two cutting-edge drone boats off the coast of California last month. The incident appears to be the first high profile case of an accidental drone-on-drone vessel casualty. The brief clip comes from a trial exercise involving multiple unmanned systems. The footage shows an immobile gray drone adrift, and a black drone approaching from starboard at high speed. The black drone hit a wave, rode up out of the water, struck and rode over the foredeck of the immobile drone, and appeared to continue on its course. Reuters reports that prior to impact, the gray drone had stopped moving unexpectedly, and that Navy operators were attempting to diagnose a software issue with it when the black drone hit it. The outlet identified the drones involved as models produced by Saronic and BlackSea Technologies. By visual identification, the drifting drone appears to be a Saronic Corsair, and the drone that hit it appears to be a BlackSea Technologies GARC. Both firms have been contacted for confirmation. It was the second such incident in two months. On June 23, a BlackSea boat that was under tow accelerated unexpectedly after a human participant sent ""an inadvertent command that turned the engine on."" It hit a support boat, capsizing the vessel and tossing the skipper into the water. The skipper was unhurt. The GARC is a widely fielded unmanned boat designed for high speed operation in combat. It is in full production and more than 100 units have been delivered. With a 1,000-pound payload, its mission sets include ISR, strike, survey work and interdiction. It supports both autonomous and remote-control operation. Human-induced collisions occur regularly, but the unmanned incidents have attracted extra attention. Reuters reports that they are part of a string of setbacks that have prompted Pentagon leaders to question the success of Naval Sea Systems Command's Program Executive Office Unmanned and Small Combatants (PEO USC). The NAVSEA division is home of the troubled Constellation-class frigate program, the scaled-back Littoral Combat Ship program, and the Navy's various unmanned-ship initiatives, like the newly-announced Modular Attack Surface Craft (MASC) program. PEO USC chief Rear Adm. Kevin Smith was removed from command of the division in May. The reported shakeup at PEO USC comes as the Navy prepares to deploy more funding than ever for unmanned vessel acquisition. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $1.5 billion for small USVs, $2.1 billion for medium USVs, $188 million for unmanned vessel R&D, and $174 million for an autonomy test center.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
UK Funds Project to Combine Carbon and Emission Capture in Southampton,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-funds-project-to-combine-carbon-and-emission-capture-in-southampton,,21/08/2025 00:39:18,,"The UK is supporting the next step in emission capture systems that can be deployed in ports as a cost-effective means of reducing emissions. The new project will combine the emissions capture capabilities of STAX Engineering with the carbon capture technology of Seabound. The project, which also involves Associated British Ports, is receiving an award of £1.1 million ($1.48 million) as a grant under the UK Government’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. They were selected as one of the recipients in the recently completed Round 6 of the competition. “This project is a breakthrough moment for ports and for the maritime decarbonization landscape,” said Stylianos Papageorgiou, Managing Director of lomarlabs, a maritime venture lab which is also supporting Seabound’s expansion. “By integrating carbon and emissions capture in a scalable, barge-based system, we’re unlocking a practical path to cleaner port operations without retrofitting ships.” The new project will be the first opportunity to integrate the two technologies and deploy them at the Port of Southampton. The companies had previously announced their plan to deploy three emission capture barges in collaboration with ABP, and will now expand the effort with the integration of carbon capture technology. STAX launched its operation in California and won the recognition of the California Air Resources Board as the state moved to stop in-port emissions from docked vessels. STAX’s uses barges that are placed alongside the ship and cap the funnel, capturing emissions. It removes up to 99 percent of particulate matter and 95 percent of nitrogen oxides. Seabound’s modular carbon capture units, sized to match standard 20-foot containers, will be integrated onto STAX’s barge-based emissions capture and control system. The purified gas coming from the STAX system will then flow into Seabound’s compact capture unit, which isolates and stores up to 95 percent of carbon dioxide and 98 percent of sulfur (SO?), before releasing cleaned exhaust. The project positions Southampton as the first UK port to host a fully-integrated solution that captures both CO2 emissions and criteria pollutants, including sulfur oxides (SO?) and nitrogen oxides (NO?), while ships are docked. The companies assert that the solution provides maritime operators with an immediate, practical path to meet tightening environmental regulations and decarbonization requirements without requiring vessels or ports to undergo retrofits and costly structural changes. ABP, as the largest port operator in the UK, is supporting efforts to advance the new technologies. In 2024, the company launched its Energy Ventures Accelerator program to aid a variety of early-stage clean energy innovators. In addition to providing support to STAX and Seabound, other initiatives supported by the accelerator include the UK’s first investment in shore power facilities at scale being developed for the Port of Southampton. For Seabound, this is its second award from the UK Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition. It received support in Round 3 for the demonstration of its carbon capture technology on an in-service vessel. Working with Lomar Shipping and lomarlabs, they demonstrated the system on the Sounion Trader, achieving 78 percent CO2 capture efficiency and over 90 percent SO2 removal. Lomar Shipping plans to deploy its carbon capture solution across the company’s fleet.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
HD Hyundai Buys Manufacturer as it Seeks Expansion in Vietnam Shipbuilding,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-buys-manufacturer-as-it-seeks-expansion-in-vietnam-shipbuilding,,20/08/2025 23:45:30,,"South Korea’s HD Hyundai is continuing to pursue opportunities to grow its shipbuilding business and increase its competitive position against the Chinese. It is acquiring a Vietnamese manufacturing business for components, including tanks and cranes, while also moving to expand its Vietnamese shipbuilding and being linked to other international deals. HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering has agreed to acquire Doosan Vina from Doosan Enerbility, a Vietnamese offshoot of the Korean industrial company Doosan. HD KSOE will pay $207 million for full ownership of the Doosan Vina business, which was established in 2006. The industrial manufacturer is located south of Da Nang in central Vietnam. Doosan Vina is a manufacturer of tanks and other components for LNG plants as well as port cranes, thermal power plant boilers, and other industrial components. HD KSOE highlights the growing need for tanks that can be used with LNG and other gas carriers, as well as the next generation of eco-friendly shipping. The acquisition comes as the company is also expanding its shipbuilding capacity in Vietnam. Its Vietnamese operations were launched as a joint venture in 1996, focused on ship repair and conversion. It completed work on over 900 ships and, starting in 2008, entered into shipbuilding. Since 2011, the operations have been totally focused on shipbuilding, with the yard mostly delivering product/chemical tankers and bulkers. Last year, HD Hyundai announced plans to expand its shipbuilding operations in Vietnam. It has a capacity to build 12 vessels a year, which it said would be increased to 15 ships per year. It is working to improve the efficiency of the shipbuilding operation. It also said it would review the possibility of expanding the capacity in Vietnam to 23 ships per year by 2030. Elsewhere in its international operations, HD Hyundai is in the process of restarting the former Hanjin shipbuilding operation at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Product work will resume by the start of next year, with the Philippine yard ramping up to a capacity of 10 ships per year. The company has also been linked to a bid for a developmental shipyard in Morocco, and it recently signed partnership agreements in the United States and India. Already the largest shipbuilder in South Korea, HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding group is focused on eco-friendly future ships and is also looking to develop new capacity and capabilities to keep up with demand and competition.

Salvors Refloat Tour Vessel That Was Caught By High Waves off Honolulu,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/salvors-refloat-tour-vessel-that-was-caught-by-high-waves-off-honolulu,,20/08/2025 22:16:52,,"Salvors have refloated and removed the tour vessel that was pushed off course by heavy wave action near Kewalo Basin, Honolulu earlier this month. On the morning of August 9, the 75-foot passenger vessel Discovery was inbound for the Kewalo Basin, a small-craft harbor in Honolulu. High waves of 10-12 feet were rolling towards the beach, and a high surf advisory was in effect. In these conditions, Discovery's master attempted to make a run through the narrow channel into the harbor. As the boat approached the channel entrance, it was overtaken by a wave. The vessel then veered sharply to starboard, broadside to the wave. Luckily Discovery was large and stable enough that it did not capsize, but the boat was disabled by impact and drifted aground on a nearby reef. The #USCG is monitoring an aground passenger vessel, the Discovery, approximately 60 feet outside Kewalo Basin Harbor with 2 people on board. The captain plans to refloat at high tide; no pollution has been reported. #hawaii pic.twitter.com/b0xojhoSvw Initial efforts to refloat Discovery were unsuccessful, but the boat had drifted up next to a seawall, and it was secured for easy access for pollution abatement crews. Oil and diesel were pumped off swiftly, reducing risk while awaiting a salvor. On August 19, a contractor working with the Coast Guard and the State of Hawaii's Division of Conservation and Resources conducted a careful refloat and removal operation. During the run-up, dive teams from the division explored the reef and determined a route that was least likely to result in harm to the coral. Larger coral colonies were documented and their coordinates were passed on to the salvor. “What we found so far is mostly damage to live rock with a couple of coral colonies that had some fragments,” said DAR Aquatic Biologist Jake Reichert in a statement. “For the removal we tried to give them a corridor that had the least amount of coral.” Now that the removal is complete, the division's biologists will conduct further assessments of the reef to evaluate any damage from the grounding and the refloat.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
New Law Paves the Way for Abandoned Vessel Removal in Charleston,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/new-law-paves-the-way-for-abandoned-vessel-removal-in-charleston,,20/08/2025 21:29:13,,"A contractor working for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has extracted a former U.S. Navy torpedo recovery vessel from a marsh outside of Charleston, South Carolina, the first boat recovered under the state's new statute on vessel abandonment. Four years ago, private citizen Mohamad ""Sam"" Kodaimati bought the torpedo retriever TWR-841 from a surplus auction, paying a total of $86,000 for the disused 120-foot vessel. TWR-841 was purpose-built for the needs of torpedo R&D at Naval UnderSea Warfare Center Newport in 1986, one of a series of 10, and was decommissioned in 2019. The vessel had useful attributes for a general-purpose coastal survey or research boat - CTD sensors, twin Cat 3512 engines, a stern U-frame, a deck winch with 5,000 feet of wire, a knuckle crane, berthing for 10 scientists or techs, and a max science payload of 17 tonnes. Kodaimati renamed TWR-841 as the Hazar and got under way to relocate the vessel. Hazar was boarded in New York on June 24, 2021 and cited for hazardous conditions and unsafe operation. The citation was lifted, and Hazar arrived in Charleston, South Carolina the following month. On July 16, 2021, the Charleston Captain of the Port ordered Kodaimati not to operate Hazar any further because the vessel lacked appropriate federal documentation. That order was never fully resolved, and Hazar remained in the backwaters of Bohicket Creek, southwest of Charleston. Over the years, Hazar took on water and settled to the bottom at her anchorage. The Coast Guard pumped off the boat's tanks to remove oily water and minimize environmental harm, but the vessel remained. Residents complained to state and local officials about the environmental hazards and unsightliness of the wreck, and petitioned for its removal. The state obliged: Earlier this year, South Carolina's legislature passed a new, stringent law to impose penalties for abandonment and create state procedures for removing derelict vessels, paving the way for a refloat operation. This week, Stevens Towing Company mobilized to the wreck site and began preparations to remove Hazar under contract to the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. The wreck was pumped out, refloated and extracted from the mud on the bank of the creek. A tug relocated the vessel to a nearby boat yard for disposal; it is as yet undetermined whether the Hazar will be reefed or cut up for scrap. The new law also provided for Kodaimati's arrest. He was detained in July and charged with two counts of abandoning a watercraft; if convicted of these misdemeanor charges, he faces potential fines in the five figures, plus restitution for the state's removal costs, which were in excess of $200,000.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

Earlier they had reported the fire was contained, but they had twice requested the assistance of Japanese forces to fight the fire aboard the vessel, which is currently anchored off Okinawa. The U.S. Navy has released few details only reporting that the cause of the fire is currently under investigation. Two sailors were reportedly taken to the New Orleans’ medical facilities for minor injuries, but the vessel is stable with no reports of pollution. The plan calls for the crew to remain aboard the ship, which according to media reports did not have a detachment of Marines aboard when the fire began. The Japanese media is reporting that the ship, which was commissioned in 2007, has been anchored off Okinawa for the past few days. It is assigned to the 7th Fleet and has been based in Sasebo, Japan, since 2019. The ship is 24,400 tons displacement and 684 feet (208 meters) in length with a maximum capacity of approximately 800 Marines. Footage shows Japanese Coast Guard ships battling a fire on the USS New Orleans (LPD-18) off Okinawa. pic.twitter.com/n0FBTtwjVo The fire appears to have begun in the forward part of the vessel around 4:00 p.m. local time on August 20. Spectators reported seeing smoke coming intermittently from the forward part of the vessel or midship. Video on Japanese TV showed tugs near the forward part of the ship spraying water on the hull. The fire was reported to the Japan Coast Guard, which sent a patrol boat to determine the extent of the situation. Around 5:00 p.m. local time, the Coast Guard reports it received a request for assistance from the U.S. Navy. However, that first call was withdrawn within the hour, and the U.S. Navy was instructing vessels to stay about one mile away. The request for assistance from the Japanese was reinstated around 7:30 p.m. local time. The Navy reports that the crew of a sister ship from the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock class, USS San Diego, which was moored at White Beach Naval Facility, assisted in fighting the fire. The Japan Self-Defense Force reported its vessels were conducting firefighting efforts to aid the crew of the USS New Orleans. The Japan Coast Guard was providing assistance. As the fire progressed, they employed a total of four tugs with two on each side of the warship to cool the full. The US 7th Fleet command thanked the Japanese for their aid. The reports emphasized that there have been no requests to evacuate any of the U.S. personnel from the vessel.

External Fire Teams Reach Marie Maersk Off Africa,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/external-fire-teams-reach-marie-maersk-off-africa,,20/08/2025 19:32:50,,"The container fire that started a week ago aboard the Marie Maersk is continuing to burn, according to the latest update from the company. Additional resources have been brought to the vessel, which is holding off the coast of Africa, and they believe the fire is contained while plans are being developed for the ship. The crew reported smoke coming from containers on the morning of August 13 as the vessel was sailing from Rotterdam bound for Malaysia and China. At the time, they said the vessel was moved toward the coast near Liberia so that shoreside resources could aid the crew. Tugs and an OSV arrived, bringing firefighting equipment to the vessel, and over the weekend, Maersk said the crew had been successful in stopping the spread of the fire. “The external firefighter crew is on board Marie Maersk since yesterday (Tuesday) and actively fighting the fire alongside the Marie Maersk crew,” Maersk said in its latest update. “As reported, the fire has been contained but not suppressed completely, and a port of refuge is also still under contemplation.” Maersk has not said the extent of the fire, such as the number of bays involved or the number of containers. The ship has a capacity for 19,000 TEU, although heading east toward Asia, the load could be smaller or include a significant number of empties. The company reports it is “in close contact with all customers who have cargo on board.” It said it is, wherever possible and known, giving customers an indication whether their cargo was likely impacted by the fire or not. At 213,971 dwt and 1,039 feet (399 meters) in length, the vessel is one of the largest in the Maersk fleet. A limited number of ports on the west coast of Africa are equipped to handle the largest containerships. The current reported position puts the vessel off southern Liberia. Multiple vessels, however, are also passing the location due to the number of ships diverting around Africa due to the closure of the Red Sea. Maersk has reported that the crew is safe. The vessel, which was built in 2013 and is registered in Denmark, is said to be in stable condition, with all machinery, steering, and navigational equipment fully operational.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Russian Drones Damage Tanker During Attack on Oil Terminal in Izmail,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/russian-drones-damage-tanker-during-attack-on-oil-terminal-in-izmail,,20/08/2025 18:50:13,,"Russia appears to have intensified its attacks on the Ukrainian fuel logistics infrastructure with a series of attacks, including targeting the largest terminal in southern Ukraine. The Triton Oil Depot came under fierce drone attacks overnight, inflicting heavy damage and catching a tanker during its offloading operations. The product tanker Excellion (7,842 dwt) had arrived from Sulina, Romania yesterday, August 19, reporting it was fully loaded, likely with diesel fuel. Built in 2008, the vessel is registered in Panama and listed as being operated by Makoil Group of the UK and managed from Estonia. According to the Russian accounts, the tanker was alongside and unloading when the drone attack began on the Port of Izmail on Tuesday evening. The reports are saying the attack was staged with drones and that there were at least 20 direct hits. Reports said there were at least 30 explosions and a large-scale fire. It went on for approximately one and a half hours. The tanker was at the Eastern Berth and sustained significant damage in part because the lines were pressurized for the ongoing offloading of fuel. Ukrainian media accounts are saying the starboard side of the vessel sustained damage, along with the pumping equipment, valves, and lines. Local officials confirmed the attack on the terminal facility in the port, but only announced one injury. A total of 54 rescuers and 16 units were dispatched to respond to the fires and subsequent explosions. (photo SSE) Russian accounts are saying there were six large storage tanks in the depot. Two of them, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters, were preliminarily reported as destroyed. A third tank was also reported damaged, with reports of a fire as it depressurized. Other parts of the facility are also being reported as heavily damaged. This includes the fuel transfer infrastructure, high-pressure pumping station, and other controls. Triton is a critical asset for Ukraine. It is reported to handle up to 20,000 tons of fuel and products each week. It is a key transfer station with the Russians claiming it was being used to supply Ukraine’s troops in the disputed eastern regions. Last night saw a widespread series of attacks across Ukraine, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. The city of Okhtyrka in eastern Ukraine, north of Kharkiv, was reportedly targeted with a heavy barrage, injuring 14 people. The attacks have increased on the fuel infrastructure, including a repeated series of attacks on the SOCAR facility near Odesa.

DarkSky International Launches New Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/darksky-international-launches-new-port-marine-terminal-lighting-program,,20/08/2025 16:10:14,,"[By: DarkSky International] DarkSky International, the leading global authority on light pollution, has launched a groundbreaking new certification program to bring responsible lighting to industrial-scale ports. The DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting Program is designed to significantly reduce light pollution, safeguarding sensitive coastal ecosystems and nearby communities, while enhancing safe and efficient working conditions. A model for sustainable industrial-scale lighting Initiated in 2023 in partnership with Port Tampa Bay, this pioneering project aims to transform Berths 301 and 218, active material handling terminals, into a model for responsible industrial lighting—while protecting sensitive wetlands and an adjacent nature preserve. Through this collaboration, the port engineering team selected state-of-the-art LED fixtures with advanced optical controls, dimming capabilities, and shielding to reduce glare and minimize light trespass beyond the port property—virtually eliminating uplight spilling into the night sky and helping protect critical marine and coastal habitats. These improvements were achieved while still meeting OSHA-required light levels and maintaining uniformity. A trusted third-party certification DarkSky Approved Port Marine Terminal Lighting is the latest addition to the DarkSky Approved programs suite, a trusted, third-party validation program that recognizes lighting products and projects that protect the night. Grounded in DarkSky’s Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting, developed in partnership with the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), this DarkSky program represents a significant leap in applying these principles to large-scale industrial environments. “The program marks a pivotal shift in how we approach lighting at an industrial level,” said Ruskin Hartley, CEO of DarkSky International. “Our partnership with Port Tampa Bay shows that dark sky quality and community-friendly lighting can be effectively scaled, reducing light pollution while maintaining and even improving operational efficiency and working conditions. It’s a win not only for Port Tampa Bay, but the community and nighttime environment as well.” Why It Matters More than 22% of the world’s coastal waters are exposed to artificial light at night, disrupting marine ecosystems, including wetlands and beaches critical for birds, pinnipeds, and nesting sea turtles, as well as habitats for fish and coral. Port terminals are often intensely illuminated, with glare and light trespass spilling into nearby communities and fragile environments. With the majority of the world’s population living along coastlines and global trade continuing to grow, balancing development with environmentally responsible lighting has never been more urgent. The new certification fills a critical gap, guiding ports in transitioning to LED lighting with proper optical control, shielding, and dimming systems. These solutions ensure light is used only where and when it’s needed, while virtually eliminating unnecessary spill into surrounding areas.

The Navy has confirmed that USS San Antonio, USS Fort Lauderdale and USS Iwo Jima have returned to the naval base to wait out rough weather. Hurricane Erin is currently moving north off the Bahamas as a Category 2 storm, and is expected to generate high waves off the U.S. East Coast through Friday. Seas of about 30 feet are in the forecast for Thursday in coastal waters off the Mid-Atlantic states, according to the National Weather Service. Significant wave height forecast (in feet) off the Eastern seaboard, Thursday, Aug. 21 (NWS) Prior to returning to base, the Iwo Jima ARG was off North Carolina to take aboard elements of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). According to Task and Purpose, Reuters and CNN, the combined 4,500-servicemember, three-ship task force was scheduled to head south to the Caribbean on a rare, undisclosed mission to deter drug-trafficking cartels. The Coast Guard (with help from the Navy) operates in the region to interdict drug traffickers, and it has historically conducted all law enforcement boardings. USNI noted that the Iwo Jima ARG's departure was the first deployment of any fully-equipped ARG in eight months. The Navy's amphib fleet readiness is deteriorating due to advancing age and persistent maintenance delays; it currently stands at about 40 percent, an official told Military Times this week - just half of the Marine Corps' desired level of Navy transport capability.

Chinese Smuggler Gets Eight Years for Shipping U.S. Guns to North Korea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/chinese-smuggler-gets-eight-years-for-shipping-u-s-guns-to-north-korea,,20/08/2025 05:06:21,,"A Chinese national who has been living in the U.S illegally has been jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to exporting weapons to North Korea in containers departing the Port of Long Beach. Shenghua Wen, 42, a Chinese national who has been in the U.S. since 2012 on an expired student visa, admitted to exporting firearms, ammunition and other military items to North Korea in a scheme that netted him $2 million from Pyongyang to procure the weapons. The guns were hidden in containers departing Long Beach for Hong Kong, then forwarded to North Korea. Wen was arrested in December last year, and pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and one count of acting as an illegal agent of a foreign government. A team of U.S investigators led by the Federal Bureau of Investigations was able to piece together the conspiracy. The scheme started in 2022 when Wen was contacted by two North Korean government officials through an online messaging platform with instructions to smuggle firearms and other goods, including sensitive technology. He is said to have met with officials from North Korea’s government at a North Korean embassy in China where he was directed to procure goods on behalf of Pyongyang. The first shipment happened in 2023 after three containers full of firearms left the Port of Long Beach to China en route to North Korea. To conceal the weapons, Wen is said to have filed false export information regarding the contents of the containers. Investigators established that in order to run the operations, Wen even purchased a firearms business in Houston that was paid for with money sent by one of his North Korean contacts. Through acquaintances, Wen oversaw the purchasing of many firearms in Texas that were transported to California for shipment to North Korea. In one of the shipments in December 2023, Wen misrepresented the box's contents as a refrigerator. The weapons shipment was later transported from Hong Kong to Nampo, North Korea. In September last year, Wen bought approximately 60,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition that he intended to ship to North Korea. Apart from weapons, the Chinese national also obtained sensitive technology including a chemical threat identification device and a handheld broadband receiver that detects known, unknown, illegal, disruptive or interfering transmissions, all of which he intended to send to North Korea. As part of the scheme, which North Korea financed by wiring $2 million, Wen also tried to buy a civilian airplane engine and a thermal imaging system that could be mounted on an aircraft, which could be used for reconnaissance and target identification. Having pleaded guilty, Wen will serve eight years in prison, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
US Navy Looks for a Commercial Manager for Marine Corps' New Landing Ship,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/us-navy-looks-for-a-commercial-manager-for-marine-corps-new-landing-ship,,20/08/2025 04:32:08,,"Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is exploring the idea of hiring a vessel construction manager to handle the future Landing Ship Medium (LSM) program, the Marine Corps' new landing craft. It is the first time in recent memory that NAVSEA - the Navy's construction manager - will outsource this role to a third party. The idea of putting an intermediary between government owner and private shipbuilder was invented during the Maritime Administration's National Security Multi-mission Vessel program. MARAD hired TOTE Services as VCM, effectively making TOTE the prime contractor, and TOTE subcontracted the construction work to Philly Shipyard. With TOTE standing between MARAD and the yard, Philly was insulated from the paperwork, bid protests and change orders that accompany government shipbuilding projects. Philly has been completing the NSMV program on budget and schedule. By contrast, all of the Navy's newbuild programs are behind schedule, some by years, according to Navy Secretary John Phelan. NAVSEA is known for strict requirements, and has been known to issue change orders; a VCM model raises the prospect of reduced friction between owner and yard, valuable if the Navy wishes to look at bids from smaller yards that have less experience with government contracting. The Landing Ship Medium is a small transport vessel for the Marine Corps, a connector to support the service's mobile anti-ship missile batteries in the islands and littorals of the Western Pacific. In the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, LSMs would help specially-equipped Marine Corps units disperse, resupply and reposition within theater, without attracting as much attention as a full-size amphibious assault ship. In April, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that Bollinger will build a lead-ship LSM based on the U.S. Army's Besson-class landing ship, as adapted by Bollinger for export sale to the Israeli Navy. NAVSEA has bought the technical data packages for both Bollinger's Besson-class variant and Damen's LST-100 design, a popular landing ship used by several allied navies. According to the Navy's request for information, the vessel construction manager will take the supplied technical data package for the LSM, help pick yard(s) to build it, and make sure that the ships get built to specification. The delivery timeline is about 36 months per hull with an initial series of eight, plus options for more.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Nuclear Cruiser Admiral Nakhimov Returns to Sea After 28 Years,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nuclear-cruiser-admiral-nakhimov-returns-to-sea-after-28-years,,20/08/2025 04:02:40,,"The nuclear-powered battlecruiser Admiral Nakhimov, pride of the Soviet fleet, has completed a decadal modernization and refit program. The vessel was recently spotted departing Sevmash Shipyard for long-awaited builder's trials on the White Sea. Admiral Nakhimov is the third of four Kirov-class nuclear battlecruisers laid down in the twilight years of the Soviet era. Designed as a true multirole surface combatant, the Kirov-class carried heavy weaponry built to target NATO's submarines, carriers, aircraft and destroyers. The large size and weight of these weapons systems influenced the selection of a large platform: the design weighs in at 28,000 tonnes full load displacement - about three times the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The class is the largest surface combatant in service today, and the only one with a nuclear powerplant. Fitted with a pair of nuclear reactors and twin oil-fired boilers, the Kirov-class can hit 32 knots at full steam. Commissioned in late 1988, Nakhimov served in an active role for nearly a decade. But Russia's struggling economy in the 1990s meant that funding was scarce for a super-warship like Nakhimov; the vessel tied up at a Murmansk pier in 1997 and didn't sail again under her own power for the next 28 years. Beginning in 2010, Nakhimov's reactor was defueled, and from 2014 onward the vessel underwent a deep refit. The weapons systems were largely removed and replaced, and Nakhimov was fitted out to carry the more modern Kalibr anti-ship missile and the S-300FM surface to air missile system. The project's scope was ambitious and has been delayed multiple times; it is currently about seven years behind schedule, but has finally been seen out on sea trials. Today, the Project 11442M Kirov-class heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser Admiral Nakhimov after repair and modernization went to sea for factory sea trials. Alekseeva/Aristovahttps://t.co/WS9nujMe60 pic.twitter.com/7j9PqKKvIe Nakhimov (in her original configuration) sailed with a crew of 700 officers and enlisted sailors. Russia's ongoing activities in Ukraine have created manning challenges, highlighted by reported crew reassignment from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. But the Nakhimov's sea trials suggest that the Russian Navy can still generate at least a minimum operating crew for its largest, most complex platforms. Only one other Kirov-class remains. Sister ship Pyotr Velikiy (top) was completed in the post-Soviet era and is in service with the Northern Fleet; the vessel has not been modernized, and is rumored to be headed for removal from service after Nakhimov's reactivation. The first two Kirov-class hulls have already been decommissioned. With Admiral Kuznetsov's refit canceled, Nakhimov appears next in line to become the flagship of Russia's navy.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
MOL and ITOCHU Plan Ammonia Bunkering Demonstrations in Singapore,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mol-and-itochu-plan-ammonia-bunkering-demonstrations-in-singapore,,20/08/2025 02:45:56,,"Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, which has announced its plans to operate some of the first ammonia-powered vessels, is joining with ITOCHU Corporation to advance plans for pioneering ammonia bunkering demonstrations. The announcement comes as the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition released its annual report highlighting that one of the largest challenges remaining for ammonia as a marine fuel is bunkering. The first ammonia bunkering of a vessel took place in Singapore at the beginning of 2024 on a demonstration basis. Since then, Japan and China have also conducted ammonia bunkering, but it is still very much on a trial basis. The Getting to Zero Coalition highlights that so far, there have not been any ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering, although a test to simulate the transfer of ammonia was undertaken off Australia nearly a year ago. Singapore has been at the forefront of mapping the safety and management requirements to develop this new field of bunkering. Norway has also issued the first safety permits, while Rotterdam is also preparing for ammonia bunkering. Under the new joint development agreement, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on initiatives with the aim of carrying out the demonstration of ship-to-ship ammonia bunkering in Singapore. They look to position as first movers in the field of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. Through the demonstrations which are planned to be carried out in the second half of 2027, MOL and ITOCHU aim to promote the early implementation of ammonia bunkering vessels and ammonia-fueled vessels. ITOCHU ordered the world's first newbuilding 5,000 cbm ammonia bunkering vessel in June 2025. The vessel will be built by Sasaki Shipbuilding Co. in Japan and is to be flagged under the Singapore Registry. It is scheduled to be delivered in 2027. Through conducting ammonia bunkering demonstrations, ITOCHU says it aims to establish safe offshore bunkering operations of ammonia as a marine fuel. Furthermore, it aims to commercialize the ammonia bunkering business at key maritime traffic locations in Singapore and other countries worldwide. ITOCHU has launched a specific-purpose company, Clean Ammonia Bunkering Shipping Pte, to proceed with the development of the ammonia bunkering business and to lead the demonstrations in Singapore. MOL has already announced that it will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH. The vessels will be built by China State Shipbuilding Corporation's Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co. and are expected to be delivered between 2026 and 2027. These vessels, chartered by MOL, will be the world's first ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers, and they will participate in the bunkering demonstration with ITOCHU’s bunker vessel. Developing the protocols and demonstrating the safety and efficacy of ammonia bunkering is seen as a key step toward developing the commercial market.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Report: Methanol and Ammonia Fuel Are Quickly Moving from Theory to Reality,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-methanol-and-ammonia-fuel-are-quickly-moving-from-theory-to-reality,,20/08/2025 02:05:02,,"The age of methanol and ammonia-powered vessels is quickly emerging, finds a new report from the Global Maritime Forum’s Getting to Zero Coalition. Based on interviews from across the industry, the report finds that both alternative fuels have made significant progress and have “arrived” as shipping fuels. The Coalition highlights that it has been tracking the process since 2020 and, based on its findings, says it believes both fuels are now ready. This is a significant increase in maturity since the first report in 2020, but they also highlight the need for significant support to get the fuels from the pilot stage to maturity. The report warns that the fuels require a concerted push if they are to be mature enough to rapidly scale from around 2030, in line with the industry’s targets. Based on the progress, the report this year focuses specifically on methanol and ammonia as marine fuels. It notes that they are relatively early in their adoption, yet have significant potential in the long term. They also shifted the analysis to three stages, starting with proof of concept, then initial scale, and finally maturity. Methanol, the report notes, is rapidly moving from proof of concept to early scale (more than 60 methanol-capable vessels in operation, 300 more on order, and bunkering available at around 42 ports). Early adopters are finding it relatively safe and straightforward to integrate. Its lower energy density, however, presents operational trade-offs but has not proven a barrier, and new retrofit kits and the relative ease of converting tanks are making retrofitting conventional vessels feasible. They note that methanol is relatively easy to bunker as it can use existing vessels with limited modifications and faces limited concerns from port workers. The key challenge for methanol to achieve broader scale-up is the availability of green methanol, which makes up only a small share of the total supply and remains challenging for shipping companies to access. Most methanol used on ships to date they note has been grey methanol, with only small volumes of bio-methanol being bunkered since 2023 and the first volumes of e-methanol being bunkered in May 2025. China, they note, is at the forefront of supplies of green methanol, but it is costly and must be accessed through long-term offtake agreements. Ammonia is acknowledged as less mature, while the report concludes it is rapidly approaching proof of concept as a marine fuel, with engine tests suggesting it can cut tank-to-wake emissions by up to 95 percent. The first ammonia-powered vessels have been successfully piloted, engine testing is near completion, and bunkering trials are underway – none of which have revealed any fundamental barriers to adoption. Operators report confidence in safely operating ammonia-powered vessels and will likely phase the fuel in over time to build operational experience. One of the big challenges they note for ammonia is mixed reactions from seafarers about the prospects of working on ammonia-fueled ships and hesitations. The Coalition notes that training of crews to operate the first wave of ammonia-powered vessels is underway. The testing they report, however, is very positive for ammonia. They note the concerns, including nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia slip, saying either could represent showstoppers for the fuel. Early engine tests, the report highlights suggest that operating on ammonia could reduce a ship’s tank-to-wake emissions by between 90 and 95 percent. They said this addresses earlier uncertainty for ammonia-fueled engines. “We are only at the start of our journey, and technology readiness is not enough by itself. To scale zero-emission fuels at the pace required, we need action from the International Maritime Organization, national policymakers, and the industry to create the right enabling conditions; this will be just as vital as the development of the technology itself."" The key area the report concludes that must be addressed is the fuel supply chain. In the case of methanol, they highlight the need for enhancing the availability of green molecules. The key points for ammonia are validating and rolling out commercial ammonia bunkering at key ports. To achieve the concerted push required to meet the industry’s decarbonization goals, the Getting to Zero Coalition says targeted policy incentives still need to be provided along with funding to close the cost gap and support early adopters. They also call for establishing robust, harmonized fuel certification systems and aggregating fuel demand to create the investment case for developing the bunkering infrastructure. They also believe that CAPEX grants will be necessary for the investment in bunkering infrastructure, and especially for bunkering vessels.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
DP World Carbon Inset Credits Rise Fivefold,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dp-world-carbon-inset-credits-rise-fivefold,,20/08/2025 01:23:58,,"[By: DP World] Credits offered by DP World to customers through its world-first Carbon Inset Programme trial will see a fivefold increase, helping businesses reduce their indirect (Scope 3) emissions. Following the programme’s initial success, which has seen over 200,000 TEUs worth of registrations since January this year, every loaded container imported through DP World’s UK ports from 1 October 2025 will qualify for Carbon Inset Credits of 250kg CO2e, up from the 50kg CO2e of credits previously offered. The additional carbon credits address the emissions associated with the entire port call of container ships when manoeuvring into London Gateway or Southampton over their ‘last nautical mile’, including the emissions of tug and pilot boats. The additional credits are enabled by the use of incrementally lower carbon fuels by both DP World’s subsidiary Unifeeder, across its Northern European shipping network, and Svitzer, under a world-first partnership that will see its tug boats in the UK transition to these fuels. John Trenchard, Vice President for Sustainable International Supply Chains at DP World, said: “The strong interest in our Carbon Inset Programme since its launch in January shows that our customers are looking for practical, tangible ways to decarbonise their supply chains. Expanding the programme allows more cargo owners to immediately benefit from emissions reductions within their logistics operations. At DP World, we’re making more sustainable trade flow through pioneering initiatives, such as using lower carbon fuels, smarter logistics, and seamless port operations, which together deliver sustainability and competitiveness side by side.” Ekaterina Riegels Hjorth, Head of Decarbonisation at Svitzer, said: ""We’re proud to team up with DP World to expand the Carbon Inset Programme to the 'last nautical mile'. This initiative demonstrates what’s possible when partners across the port ecosystem unite around a shared ambition to deliver real, scalable emissions reductions.” Those importers who have already registered for the programme will automatically qualify for the increase in available carbon inset credits. For companies not yet registered, they can register at DP World Carbon Inset Programme Trial. DP World’s market-leading sustainability initiatives, including the Modal Shift and Carbon Inset Programmes and the use of lower carbon solutions at London Gateway and Southampton, earned the company the ‘Sustainability Company of the Year’ award at the 2025 Multimodal Awards.

CMA CGM Takes First Delivery of Containers Made in Vietnam,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/cma-cgm-takes-first-delivery-of-containers-made-in-vietnam,,20/08/2025 00:46:55,,"CMA CGM highlighted today, August 19, that it took delivery of 1,000 twenty-foot containers manufactured in Vietnam. It was the first time the French shipping company had sourced containers built in Vietnam. While a small step, it was still a symbolic move in the ongoing efforts to break China’s stronghold on the segments of the shipping industry. Estimates show that between 85 and 95 percent of all containers are manufactured in China. A ranking of the top container manufacturers prepared by Container Xchange, an equipment matching platform for boxes, shows that four of the top five box manufacturers are based in China. CIMC (China International Marine Container Group) is the largest manufacturer created by COSCO, and now with 11 factories able to churn out roughly two million boxes annually. It is closely followed by Dong Fang International Container Group (DFIC), which says it has a capacity to build 1.6 million boxes annually. Then commissioner of the Federal Maritime Commission, Carl Bentzel, studied the container manufacturing market for the FMC. In a 2022 report, Bentzel concluded that it was not accidental that the Chinese had taken control of the container manufacturing market, much like they have also taken control of the manufacture of large shoreside cranes used to transfer boxes in ports. The report noted the critical role of containers and challenges that emerged in 2020 and beyond during the pandemic and the surge in shipping. Carriers were fighting for every box while Bentzel concluded China had been slow to ramp up production. He raised the question of possible price manipulation among other concerns. “It is clear to the author (Bentzel) that the issue of Chinese state control of the manufacture of containers and chassis issue needs much closer review. The current supply chain disruption provides illumination on the larger issues related to monopolistic control of critical elements needed to facilitate international trade in containers,” the report concluded. CMA CGM, in announcing that it had taken delivery of the 1,000 containers, positioned it as part of the group’s ongoing expansion in Southeast Asia. The boxes were manufactured by Hoa Phat Group, which is billed as the largest container manufacturer in Vietnam. CMA CGM said the boxes would strengthen its equipment availability, shorten turnaround times, and optimize supply chain efficiency. Vietnam is looking to take advantage of the opportunities it sees emerging in the market. It has launched shipbuilding and other services such as container manufacturing. It is also expanding its ports and positioning them as a possible transshipment location, creating new supply chains for Southeast Asia and beyond.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56

After a slow start delayed by weather and the remote location of the vessel, the latest update said the bulk of the oil has been removed from the internal tanks, and nearly three-quarters of the containers have been offloaded. Fuel has been and remains the largest concern for the vessel, which is firmly aground in a cove on the western shore of Newfoundland. The weather and grounding caused cracks in the hull, and the vessel has been weeping small amounts of oil, with a few tar balls found along the shorelines. The ship blacked out on February 15 and was driven ashore, with the Canadians conducting a daring helicopter rescue of the 20 crewmembers aboard. When they were able to begin a survey of the vessel, at first, they said there was as much as 1,710 metric tons (1.7 million liters) of heavy fuel oil and Marine Gas Oil aboard as fuel. Later soundings of the tanks lowered the quantity to 1,600 metric tons, but the concern remained that the tanks would leak, causing an environmental disaster. The process of removing the fuel has been laborious as it needs to be heated with steam. The Coast Guard has said that it takes up to a week, and then the fuel is pumped from the ship’s tanks to temporary storage tanks that were placed on the deck. However, those tanks once filled are too heavy to lift, so the fuel has to be again heated and pumped to tanks on a barge placed alongside. MSC’s salvage company has been organizing this, and the fuel is ultimately loaded aboard other passing MSC containerships. The salvage effort was quickly able to secure and then remove a small number of containers with hazardous materials. The ship, in total, had approximately 475 containers aboard, although reports said more than half were empties. The vessel’s onboard cranes have continued to work, and they have aided with the offloading of the boxes. Last week, the Coast Guard said a further 26 containers had been removed. A total of 333 containers have been offloaded, with a further 142 remaining on the vessel. With the fuel tanks largely empty, the focus is now on the approximately 10 percent of residual oil aboard. The Coast Guard considers the remaining fuel oil equally important because if it were to leak, it could still cause significant environmental damage. No plans have been announced for the hulk. Early assessments said it would not be possible to remove the vessel in its current state while it was still loaded. It is unclear if there will attempt to pull the vessel free after the offloading is completed or if they plan to cut the vessel up in its current position.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Gulf Visit by USS Nimitz Prompts Iranian Deployment,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/gulf-visit-by-uss-nimitz-prompts-iranian-deployment,,19/08/2025 23:11:53,,"The USS Nimitz (CVN-68), flagship of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 11 has passed back out through the Straits of Hormuz, having called in Bahrain on August 9 to make the first visit to the Naval Support Facility and headquarters of Fifth Fleet since 2020. The CSG escort group is found from Destroyer Squadron 9, currently comprising the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers USS Gridley (DDG-101), USS Wayne E. Meyer (DDG-108), USS Lenah Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG-123). The CSG is now operating in the Northern Arabian Sea. The US deployment is routine, and in the past the Iranian press have given bombastic coverage to US carrier movements in the Gulf. But the movement of the CSG has not rated any mention in the Iranian media on this occasion. Instead, and probably prompted by the CSG’s activity both in the Gulf and now off Iran’s southern coast, Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor is currently almost empty of Iranian Navy (Nedaja) ships, suggesting that the Nedaja Southern Fleet deployed to track the movements of the CSG through the Straits. As of August 19, there were no frigates tied up back in Bandar Abbas. Only one Hengam-class landing ship was in port, suggesting others were out performing their replenishment at sea role. The only major ship still in port is the forward base ship IRINS Makran (K441) on its usual pier in the outer harbor. Moored alongside is a 187-meter replenishment ship with helicopter deck, which has not previously been seen in Bandar Abbas. An empty Bandar Abbas Naval Harbor on August 19, save for IRINS Makran (K441) on its normal pier in the outer harbor, with another but unidentified replenishment ship alongside (Sentinel-2/CJRC) The reticence of the Iranians regarding the CSG is probably attributable to the high degree of nervousness in Iran that Israeli and American air attacks could resume. Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, an IRGC senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned on August 17 that the war with Israel could resume at any point, noting that “We are not in a ceasefire, we are at war. No ceasefire protocol, regulation or agreement has been written between us and the US or Israel,” he told Iranian news agency IRNA, stressing the need to be prepared for a recurrence of attacks and “the worst scenario”. His warning was backed up by Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and by parliamentarian Amir Hayat-Moqaddam, both of whom threatened that Iran would retaliate if attacked. Hayat-Moqaddam claimed that “we can move our ships to within 2,000 kilometers of the US, and from there target Washington, New York, and other cities. Right now, all European countries are within our range.” The principal such ship to deliver such a threat, the IRGC Navy’s angle-decked drone and missile carrier Shahid Bagheri (C110-4), remains anchored off Bandar Abbas at 27.05259N 56.14499E as it has been for many weeks, with its sister ship Shahid Madhavi (C110-3) close by at 27.090408N 56.179668E. Weeks after Israeli and American attacks, tensions remain extremely high in Iran. Responding to the humiliations and indications of weakness exposed in the attacks, hardliners are urging the Supreme Leader not to compromise, and to redouble Iran’s program of regional expansionism and nuclear development. Reformists, represented by the President Masoud Pezeshkian, are urging a resumption of negotiations with the United States and the E3 nations, and a recognition that previous policies have dangerously alienated popular opinion in Iran, jeopardizing the stability of the Islamic regime. Hardliners and reformists have always fought each other within Iran’s ruling elite, but the antagonism between the two factions is now at unprecedented levels. A similar polarization of views is occurring amongst the wider population, with secular patriots set against religious patriots. At stake is stability in the country, which if upset would cause massive disruption to commerce - and to the security on which the maritime trade depends right across the Gulf.

Trump Administration Commits to Ambitious Offshore O&G Lease Schedule,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-commits-to-ambitious-offshore-o-g-lease-schedule,,19/08/2025 21:20:42,,"Following quickly on the passage of the Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Department of Interior has scheduled a series of oil and gas lease sales for the U.S. Gulf and for Cook Inlet in Alaska. It represents the most ambitious long-term lease plan for offshore Alaska in years. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a landmark step toward unleashing America’s energy potential,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re putting in place a bold, long-term program that strengthens American Energy Dominance, creates good-paying jobs and ensures we continue to responsibly develop our offshore resources.” The lease plan includes a commitment to hold auctions twice annually for acreage in the Gulf between 2025 and 2040. Interior noted that the Gulf offshore patch accounts for about 15 percent of U.S. oil output; as the best onshore shale fields begin to mature in the Eagle Ford and Permian, the Gulf will be responsible for an increasing share of the total. The announcement is a major uptick in commitment to leasing in Alaska, but it remains to be seen whether it results in additiona activyt. Unlike in the Gulf, industry interest in Cook Inlet has been tepid in recent years. Only one company, Hilcorp, submitted bids in the last two federal and state lease auctions. The most recent BOEM auction for the area was held in 2022, and it secured a single bid of $64,000 from Hilcorp for a single lease block. The announcement is supported regionally. Alaska's state government has a long-term commitment to the success of the oil and gas industry, which is the source of a large share of the state's tax revenue. “Continued activity and investment in the Cook Inlet is needed now more than ever as we continue to try to secure local natural gas supplies for Alaskans along the Railbelt,” says Commissioner John Boyle of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources earlier this year. “The department will continue to do all we can to offer highly competitive new leases in the inlet and to actively manage all existing leases to ensure that known resources are brought into development.” The near-term oil price outlook may not encourage more E&P bidding or FIDS, though it is very favorable for American consumers. U.S. EIA forecasts an average Brent crude price of just $51 per barrel next year, down from a current price of $66 - leading to cheaper gas and diesel at the pump. The agency expects that total U.S. oil production will fall slightly in response to lower potential for profit. ""As crude oil prices fall, we expect U.S. producers will accelerate the decreases in drilling and well completion activity that have been ongoing through most of this year, and we forecast U.S. crude oil production will decline to 13.1 million b/d by 4Q26,"" the agency said in a statement.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
"Containership Orders Reach New High, Raising Fresh Concerns",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/containership-orders-reach-new-high-raising-fresh-concerns,,19/08/2025 21:13:19,,"Orders for new containerships have remained strong and, despite the market uncertainties, are continuing to build. A new update from market intelligence firm Linerlytica highlights the growth in orders while also saying it is raising concerns. The major carriers are the ones topping the orderbook. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, for example, despite already being far ahead of its competitors, has orders totaling as much as a third of its current capacity. CMA CGM is over 40 percent of its current capacity, as is Ocean Network Express (ONE). COSCO and Evergreen are each above 30 percent of their current capacity. Linerlytica calculates the total orderbook stands at a record high of 10.4 million TEU of capacity following a flurry of orders in the past 12 months. Other calculations, such as Alphaliner, have set the total capacity for orders slightly lower, approaching 10 million TEU, but the orders continue to build, with more rumored to be in negotiations. Linerlytica reports current orders represent 31.7 percent of the global fleet capacity. “It’s the highest level since 2010,” they write in the update. “The last time the orderbook ratio exceeded this level in 2004-2009, it ended in a decade-long supply overhang that took 10 years to clear,” warns Linerlytica. Some of the carriers have said they are building fleet replacements. Maersk, for example, has orders at nearly 20 percent of its capacity. Last year, it said its focus was on modernization and fleet replacement. It declared an intent to remain near its current 4.6 million TEU capacity. The sector is booming at the moment, although from the recent financial reports, it remains under pressure due to rising costs and uncertainty for freight rates. Linerlytica points out that just 0.3 percent of the global fleet is idle currently. It said there were 19 new vessels delivered in the past 30 days, adding 184,000 TEU of capacity, while just three vessels with 3,000 TEU of capacity were removed from operations. The expansion is against a backdrop of the ongoing U.S. tariff wars and a vacillating near-term strategy on tariff implementation. The closing of the Red Sea and Suez Canal route has kept capacity demand high, but now analysts question the impact of the U.S. tariffs, planned U.S. port fees on Chinese-built ships, and the overall health of the global economy. Linerlytica highlights that there is an additional 1 million TEU of capacity due to be added before the end of this year, but that the pace will slow. The first surge came with the orders placed during and after the pandemic, but then there was a lull, which will be reflected in a slower pace of additions in 2026 and 2027. The orders placed in this latest surge will begin to enter the industry in 2028 and 2029. While more of the ships are dual-fuel or designed for alternative fuels, the industry will also be faced with the need to take more aggressive steps to respond to the new environmental regulations. That creates the possibility that portions of these future deliveries will be fleet replacements for older ships, but Linerlytica highlights the orderbook is a cause for concern.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Baltimore Channel Reopens With Backlog Following Vessel Explosion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vessel-backlog-grows-as-baltimore-channel-is-closed-after-vessel-explosion,,19/08/2025 19:32:05,,"The Port of Baltimore reported mid-afternoon on Tuesday that the U.S. Coast Guard reopened the shipping channel into Baltimore following the explosion and fire aboard the bulker W-Sapphire last night. As of midday on Tuesday, August 19, a dozen large vessels were waiting for the Fort McHenry Federal Channel while the U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the incident. AIS signals show the vessels holding south of the harbor in the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay near Annapolis, Maryland. It includes MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and CMA CGM containerships, as well as bulkers and two vehicle carriers that were unable to proceed into Baltimore as the Patapsco River had been closed to all vessel traffic. There are other ships at the Dundalk and Sparrows Point terminals in Baltimore. The first vessels started moving after 5:00 p.m. local time with some restrictions still on traffic. The Port of Baltimore had advised that it will be the U.S. Coast Guard that would “determine when the channel can safely reopen, as well as the timing of vessel arrivals and departures.” The W-Sapphire (81,681 dwt) remains anchored in the channel. Several McAllister tugs were standing by the vessel. Built in 2012, the vessel is registered in Liberia and managed from Greece. In February 2025, the vessel was cited for issues with fire safety by the Australians during a Port State inspection, and in May, it received 11 deficiencies during an expanded inspection in Spain. It was cited for issues ranging from the gyro and magnetic compass to fire safety and crew welfare, but the vessel was not detained. The Baltimore Fire Department reports it responded to the vessel last night and assisted with the firefight below deck. They said the fire was extinguished, but there are visible signs of damage both from the explosion and the subsequent fire. During the radio communication, the vessel said it was taking water into its number two hold after the explosion, but was afloat and still underway. During the explosion, the Coast Guard reports a hatch detached and entered the water and its exact location was unknown. The US Army Corps of Engineers deployed a sonar-equipped survey vessel to the incident site at approximately 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Buck collected data to identify any obstructions to the safe navigation of traffic entering or exiting the Port of Baltimore via the Fort McHenry Federal Channel. They located the hatch and reduced the restrictions while saying it would be retrieved. The Coast Guard said that there were 23 crewmembers and two pilots aboard the bulker as it departed the terminal and was outbound to Africa. They are reporting that there were no injuries to the people aboard and that damage was limited to the vessel. The Coast Guard established a 2,000-yard safety zone around the incident location, spanning from the Key Bridge to Brewerton Angle Channel LB “14”. Following the explosion aboard the W-Sapphire, members of the Baltimore County Police Department’s Marine Team assisted in securing a perimeter around the vessel Monday night. The department released the audio from the Marine Channel in the moments after the explosion as everyone was trying to determine what was occurring. The first report of the incident was received from a distress call via VHF channel 16 at approximately 6:30 p.m. local time. The vessel clearly says that it was reporting a coal explosion. The second pilot stepped in to manage the communication from the vessel as the crew was working to stop the vessel and control the unfolding situation, including the fire. The Coast Guard said in an update midday on Tuesday that crews are awaiting verification to confirm safe conditions before proceeding with further investigations onboard the vessel.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 09:29:56
Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,24/08/2025 21:27:46

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region.

The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

Hackers Disable Iranian Merchant Shipping Communications,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hackers-disable-iranian-merchant-shipping-communications,,24/08/2025 20:33:14,,"Iran International, the London-based media site covering Iranian affairs - which is constantly a target of the Iranian authorities - has carried claims that a hacking group has disrupted the communications of Iran’s merchant fleet. It reports that in a recent attack mounted by the cyber hacker group Lab-Dookhtegan, ship-to-shore communications of 39 tankers and 25 cargo ships belonging to the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) were disrupted. Neither NITC nor IRISL have acknowledged any operational impacts. Little is known of the Lab-Dookhtegan group or its sponsorship, save that from its name it is Iranian-focused. The group carried out similar operations against Iranian shipping in March 2025, claiming to have disrupted the communications capabilities of 116 NITC and IRISL vessels. The attack in March coincided with Operation Rough Rider, during which US forces mounted an air offensive against Houthi targets in Yemen. Lab-Dookhtegan claims to have carried out its attack by targeting communications services provided to NITC and IRISL by the Fanava Group, the net result being that the host’s Falcon cybersecurity system was breached and ship-to-shore communications and AIS services were disrupted. The results claimed by Lab-Dookhtegan, about which very little is known, have been technically assessed as being credible by Cyberdome, an Israeli global maritime cybersecurity provider, which has examined the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by Lab-Dookhtegan. Fanava is an IT and communications company based in Tehran, apparently privately owned. In addition to hosting wide area networks using VSAT satellite equipment, it also has a financial services subsidiary handling card payments. Fanava Group does not seem to appear on US, UK or EU sanctions lists. In recent months, both the US and UK sanctioning authorities have gone beyond their listings of ships, brokers and owners to include those providing services to dark fleet operations. For example, in July the US Treasury listed ship manager Draco Buren for its role in loading Iranian containers onto ships leased by SeaLead, both Singaporean entities. Then on August 21, the US Treasury listed two Zhejiang port handling companies in Dongjiakou and Yangshan, DJK Oil Products and Yangshan Shengang, on the basis that they had handled Iranian crude cargoes. On the same day, the UK belatedly sanctioned a network of shipping services and commodity companies run by Mohammad Hossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkani. Shamkani (senior) survived an Israeli attack during the 12-Day War and remains a senior security advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The effectiveness of sanctions is dependent on the willingness of most entities to comply, in effect a form of community self-policing. But it also relies on the effectiveness of enforcement action against the careless, and those deliberately seeking to circumvent the rules. The US Treasury’s OFAC imposed 12 civil penalties in 2024, issuing a total of $48.8 million in fines. So far in 2025, OFAC has issued seven fines totaling $235.9 million. The UK Treasury’s OFSI in contrast has taken four enforcement actions this year, levying a total of $1.04 million in fines, all directed against Russia/Ukraine-related breaches, none concerned with Iranian oil, and none directed against non-UK domiciles. Dr Helen Taylor, of the Spotlight on Corruption pressure group, described the UK sanctions regime as ‘all bark and no bite’. The labored UK enforcement action in particular is unlikely to prove any obstacle to the fast-moving networks using front companies, Swiss lawyers, false identities and fictitious addresses which Iranian sanctions-busters are adept at developing. Seizure of valuable oil cargoes at sea is probably the only credible enforcement action, but will present diplomatic challenges and currently lacks a tested legal basis in international maritime law. Such considerations may come to the fore should US and EU3 snap-back sanctions be reintroduced, which is on the cards if Iran prevaricates in negotiations with the EU3, scheduled for August 25 in advance of the October JCPOA deadline.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 04:46:41

The first phase will involve developing a green vessel recycling facility; the second component will include a shipbuilding center, providing ship construction and maintenance services; and lastly, the third phase includes building oil and gas storage facilities. “With the establishment of the shipyard complex, Pahang will emerge as a regional maritime hub, providing competitive services in shipbuilding, green ship recycling and oil and gas hub,” said Wan Rosdy, Head of Pahang State. The state is also implementing a similar project in the Gebeng industrial area, the Kuantan Maritime Hub (KMH), located about 35 miles to the north of Pekan. The $500 million project is being developed by Muhibbah Engineering and is scheduled for completion in 2034. The KMH project covers a 500-acre site, with some parts reclaimed from the sea. The hub is expected to host industries ranging from commercial shipbuilding and ship repair to defense and technical training. These flagship projects are important for Malaysia to retain a long-term standing in the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s CEO, Sikh Shamsul Ibrahim. “Malaysia should always remain vigilant of rising competition from lower cost yards in neighboring economies such a Vietnam and Indonesia. We should start focusing on reducing reliance on foreign automation tools, by approaching local robotic manufacturing in Malaysia, which could build a whole new automated system integration to improve productivity in our shipbuilding landscape,” added Sikh Shamsul. As of June, the authority said it has approved shipbuilding and ship repair sector investments worth over $230 million, showing sustained interest by the private sector to invest in the Malaysian shipyard sector.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03
"To Take On a Bigger Role, Malaysia's MMEA Buys a Bigger Ship",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/to-take-on-a-bigger-role-malaysia-s-mmea-buys-a-bigger-ship,,25/08/2025 04:53:12,,"This month, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) held a keel laying ceremony for a new Multi-Purpose Mission Ship (MPMS) in Turkey. The event marked another milestone in the construction of MMEA’s largest vessel, with the steel-cutting ceremony held last month. Construction is under way at Desan Shipyard after a memorandum of understanding with MMEA back in February. The signing of the construction contract followed in May, with the vessel scheduled for delivery in 2027. The construction project also involves cooperation with other Turkish defense industry companies such as Aselsan and Havelsan. The two companies will be involved in the installation of advanced weaponry, detection and communication systems. The 99-meter-long vessel will serve deep sea operations lasting 28 days without resupply. It will have capacity for 70 crew members and additional room for 30 passengers. For surveillance and interdiction, it will be equipped with two unmanned aerial vehicles, four fast interceptor craft, a helicopter deck and detention compartments. According to MMEA, the vessel will be deployed for surveillance in Malaysia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), especially in the South China Sea. In the past few years, Malaysia’s EEZ has become a hotspot for illegal Ship-to-Ship (STS) oil transfers. This has mainly involved older ships carrying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, raising concerns about compliance, safety and pollution. Recently, Malaysia has introduced new regulations with an aim to curb shadow fleet STS transfers. Some of the efforts include closing the notorious Tompok Utara anchorage and layup area near the Singapore Strait. However, MMEA emphasizes that it requires enhanced operational and patrolling capabilities to curb increased criminal activities in Malaysian waters. Last year, the agency got a budgetary allocation of $159 million to procure new vessels and maintain existing ones. Almost half of this allocation - $82 million - went into the acquisition of the MPMS. Another $37 million went into the procurement of two New Generation Patrol Craft (NGPC).",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 09:34:03

Video: Chilean Navy Rescues Survivor From the Rocks in Tierra Del Fuego,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-chilean-navy-rescues-survivor-from-the-rocks-in-tierra-del-fuego,,25/08/2025 05:57:42,,"Against all odds, the Chilean Navy has rescued a survivor from a fishing vessel that went missing off Tierra del Fuego on Thursday. The four fishermen aboard the vessel were harvesting sea urchins, and the crew disappeared along with their vessel, the Ana Belen. Good Samaritan fishermen located the survivor - who was wearing a black wetsuit - in an area known locally as the Bahia Sea, near the western entrance to Beagle Channel. The maze of inlets at the westward fringe of Tierra del Fuego bears the full brunt of the region's stormy weather, and this creates real challenges for shore access. The survivor could not be reached by helicopter because of powerful downdrafts from the cliffs above, and heaving surf made it impossible to get a small boat near to the rocky shoreline. To complete the retrieval of the survivor, a Chilean Navy helicopter dropped a rescue swimmer into the water near the rocks, and he swam through the waves and climbed up on shore to reach the fisherman. Then, together, they got back into the frigid water and swam out to a pickup point. ""The extraction lasted approximately 25 minutes, which was vitally important since they had to swim to the rescue boat that was waiting for them in a safe place,"" said Serio Surriba, commander of the naval aviation unit in Puerto Williams. The survivor has been identified as Juan Andrés Rojas Casco, a Paraguayan national. The search for the three other missing fishermen continues, and the Chilean Navy has pledged to make ""every effort to find the rest of the crew.""

At about 0730 hours Friday morning, the police department in Pascagoula, Mississippi responded to the Ingalls yard after a report of a shooting. Ingalls' management initiated a lockdown protocol, including a shelter-in-place order for all onsite personnel. All 8,000 workers on the site were organized into sections and the police searched through these groups one by one until they found the suspect, ""which worked out very great,"" Pascagoula Police Chief Terry Scott told reporters. The police took the suspect in custody after about 90 minutes of searching, and the remains of one deceased employee were recovered at the scene. The Pascagoula Police Department has named the suspect as Curtis James Jr., 25, a resident of Mobile; and the victim as Tahj Johnson, 27. James has since been charged with murder in connection with the shooting. Curtis James Jr. (Jackson County Sheriffs Department) James and Johnson were coworkers in the Ingalls paint department, and the two men had a disagreement, the police reported Friday. Local media reports suggest that James had had an argument with Johnson earlier in the week and again just prior to the shooting. The suspect does not appear to have targeted other personnel or the vessel itself. The ship in question was the newly-christened destroyer USS Jeremiah Denton, according to USNI, and it sustained no meaningful damage. James has a history of prior arrests, according to the local Fox News affiliate, but in all cases the charges were dismissed. It is not yet clear how James' gun made it past gate security, and Ingalls is investigating. The gun has not been found.

Pirate Attacks on Fishermen are Underreported - And Deadly,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pirate-attacks-on-fishermen-are-underreported-and-deadly,,25/08/2025 01:32:18,,"[By Bryan Peters and Letizia Paoli] In late April 2018, about 40 nautical miles off Paramaribo, Suriname, what started as a routine day of fishing for 20 mostly Guyanese commercial fishers turned into a massacre. A group of armed Surinamese pirates attacked their four vessels. The fishers were brutally beaten. Some were chopped with machetes. Others were burned with hot oil. All were forced overboard, some with heavy car batteries and other objects tied to their legs. The perpetrators fled with the fishers’ vessels, equipment and catch. Only five survived. While three bodies were eventually recovered, twelve remain missing and are presumed dead. The attack sent a wave of fear through nearby fishing communities. Prevailing assumptions about maritime piracy are often based on dramatic tales of high-seas hijackings of large commercial vessels. Our research has uncovered a different reality – one in which piracy often strikes closer to shore and disproportionately affects small-scale fishers, like those targeted off Suriname. These communities, largely absent from mainstream security discussions, are emerging as frequent and vulnerable victims. Our inspiration to dig deeper While the economic impacts of piracy have been examined, its harms to people and coastal communities are far less studied. When we looked at Nigerian piracy we found that fishers are increasingly becoming the victims and are suffering serious consequences. Attacks on fishers made up 14% of all reported piracy incidents worldwide between 2003 and 2023, showed our preliminary analysis on the harms of piracy, as part of a project funded by Research Foundation – Flanders (Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek). While 14% may sound small, it is striking given the data was sourced from organizations that primarily track threats against commercial shipping: the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Knowing that piracy often goes unreported, we had a hunch these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg. We decided to dig deeper. However, our investigation hit two major roadblocks early on. First, there’s no consistent data tracking piracy incidents where fishers are the victims. Second, while some studies explore the link between fishing and piracy, most focus on why fishers become perpetrators, not victims. Except for a few studies in the Gulf of Guinea, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, the experiences of fishers as victims have largely been overlooked. Exposing the underreporting of attacks against fishers To overcome these roadblocks, we combined the data from our preliminary work with incidents sourced from press reports for 2019 to 2023. Our results have recently been published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. During this period, 251 piracy incidents were identified globally in which 701 fishing vessels were targeted. Another 472 press reports identified piracy outbreaks targeting fishers without referencing specific incidents. One report noted 850 attacks on small-scale fishers off Atacames and Esmeraldas, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2021. Of the 251 cases we identified, 201 were reported only by the press, while 27 appeared solely in incident reports from the IMB and the NGA. Twenty-three incidents were documented in both sources. So piracy attacks on fishers appear to happen far more often than official reports suggest. And our numbers also likely underestimate the true scale of the problem (for example, because we only looked at English-language press reports). Far-reaching consequences for victims and their communities Our work confirms earlier case studies and shows that fishers – particularly small-scale fishers – suffer serious, direct harms from piracy. Violence was prevalent in over half of the reported incidents, impacting 1,053 fishers. Twenty-seven incidents resulted in 66 fatalities, while 114 individuals were thrown overboard in 11 additional cases and are presumed dead. Physical assaults were reported in 64 further incidents, with over half classified as severe, involving gunfire, beatings or attacks with knives and machetes. Those who survived attacks suffered property losses, which were reported in 78% of incidents. Commonly stolen items included fish, outboard engines, fishing gear, navigation and communication equipment, mobile phones and personal belongings. In 37 incidents, entire vessels were taken. For small-scale fishers, losing equipment or vessels is devastating, as these are their main sources of livelihood. Beyond the direct individual victims, piracy threatens the social and economic sustainability of communities that rely on small-scale capture fisheries and related activities like fish processing, gear manufacturing and repair, and market sales. Small-scale fisheries account for more than half of the world’s fish catch, primarily for local markets. These attacks, consequently, endanger food security, especially in Global South countries where seafood is a crucial source of nutrition. What can be done to protect fishers? The dominant narrative around piracy, focussed on harms to global shipping and other big business, prioritises commercial interests over human lives and highlights global economic disparities. Urgent action is needed to change this, as attacks on fishers persist across many regions, with the human cost rising, especially in the Global South. Improved data collection and further research are essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of this issue. In regions where fishers are known to be targeted, governments and/or local academics could conduct in-depth case studies – as they would be better positioned to access law enforcement and other official data sources. With improved data, systematic and empirical assessments of the harms of piracy – whether at the local, regional or global level – could become more feasible. Using already available assessment tools, governments and researchers could identify, evaluate, rank and prioritise the harms associated with piracy against fishers. This would provide a robust evidence base to support policymakers in setting priorities and selecting the most appropriate interventions. Our earlier work on Nigerian piracy shows this is possible. While it may sound pessimistic, the reality is that piracy – like most crimes – is likely to persist. What we can do is target and try to reduce the most serious harms. Until the issue is better understood, interim measures to protect those most at risk are needed. Since most attacks take place in territorial and internal water, we need to acknowledge that piracy is a local problem – one that requires a local response. Authorities must establish secure and inclusive mechanisms that encourage fishers to report all events, irrespective of severity, while addressing barriers such as fear of retaliation and distrust in government institutions. Increased proactive patrols and rigorous investigations of reported incidents is essential to signal governmental commitment to addressing piracy and to reduce the culture of impunity among perpetrators. When governments are unwilling or unable to act, civil society and the private sector can play a crucial role. Informal reporting systems could be established by existing fishing cooperatives or NGOs supporting the sector. At a minimum, such systems would encourage fishers to report incidents or suspected pirate activity, even anonymously, allowing information and warnings to be shared with others in the community. This would help fishers make safer, more informed decisions about when and where to fish. Inspiration could be taken from initiatives like the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), a non-profit representing the Caribbean yachting community. CSSN allows affected yachters to submit reports through its website and issues warnings to help other yachters plan safer routes. For small-scale fishers, the sea is already full of risks – extreme weather, uncertain catches, declining stocks, exploitation and economic pressure. Piracy and other forms of predation should not be among them. Our findings make clear that a broader, more inclusive approach to maritime security is urgently needed – one that values all lives at sea, not just those tied to global trade. Protecting fishers means acknowledging their vulnerability, listening to their experiences, and investing in solutions tailored to the realities they face.

Eastern Libya Set to Approve Turkey’s Mediterranean Gas Exploration Deal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/eastern-libya-set-to-approve-turkey-s-mediterranean-gas-exploration-deal,,25/08/2025 01:25:11,,"Turkey is poised to strengthen its exploration rights in the Mediterranean region. Reports have emerged that Libya’s eastern-based government is likely to approve a 2019 maritime pact, which allows Turkey to explore for oil and gas in Libyan waters. The agreement had only been signed by the Tripoli-based government in Western Libya, which has strong ties with Ankara. However, the eastern side in Benghazi seems to have softened its opposition to Turkey. According to Bloomberg, the Parliament in Benghazi is expected to approve the maritime pact with Turkey in coming weeks. The approval will give Turkey unfettered access to Libyan waters, where the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) is about to begin geological and geophysical surveys. The ratification of the pact is seen as a major milestone for Turkey’s ongoing diplomatic efforts to unify Libya’s two rival governments. Early this week, the Turkish navy vessel TCG Kinaliada made a port visit in Tripoli. The vessel is also expected in Benghazi, an indication of the warming relations between Turkey and eastern Libya. The de facto leader of eastern Libya, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has been at odds with the Tripoli government over control of Libya’s oil revenue. The possibility of the two sides reaching a consensus on the exploration rights offers a glimmer of hope to Libya’s stability. But the prospect of enacting the Turkey-Libya pact is likely to exacerbate ongoing maritime disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. The agreement opens up the expansive Libyan EEZ to exploration by Turkish vessels, an area that overlaps with maritime claims of Greece and Cyprus. Both countries accuse Turkey of wanting to control the disputed waters, known for significant oil and gas reserves. The hydrocarbon blocks near the Greek island of Crete are among the most contested. In June, the Tripoli-based Libyan government objected to Greece’s tender call for hydrocarbon exploration south of Crete. The Libyan government argued that some of the areas in the region constitute its maritime zone. It remains to be seen how energy politics in the Eastern Mediterranean will pan out, especially at a time Turkey appears to be gaining influence in the region. As Turkey pushes to become a regional energy hub, the Mediterranean Sea presents significant potential in achieving the ambition. Recently, Turkey bought two drillships, which will boost its exploration capacity in the Mediterranean region.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
The US Navy Needs Frigates to Save Taiwan - But Doesn't Have Them,https://maritime-executive.com/article/the-us-navy-needs-frigates-to-save-taiwan-but-doesn-t-have-them,,25/08/2025 01:01:51,,"[By David Axe] If China ever makes good on decades of threats and invades Taiwan, it could succeed or fail in the span of a few hours—the hours it would take to sail an invasion force across the Taiwan Strait and land troops on beaches or in ports. A lot could go wrong for the Chinese. Bad weather could slow the crossing. Taiwanese missiles, mines and drones and US submarines could sink enough of the invasion fleet to disrupt the landing sequence, potentially buying time for American bombers, winging across the vast Pacific Ocean, to launch devastating barrages of anti-ship missiles. A depleted and confused landing force could be vulnerable to Taiwanese counterattack. That’s why China might choose to slowly strangle Taiwan instead of knocking it out with a single swift blow. It’s the less risky approach—and the Taiwanese and their allies aren’t ready for it. Taiwanese and US forces are arming themselves for a short, decisive battle over the Taiwan Strait. They’re not arming themselves for a drawn-out maritime blockade that might play out across millions of square miles of lonely ocean. Most alarmingly, the Americans have botched an effort to acquire a large flotilla of inexpensive frigates that would be ideal for convoy escort duty—the kind of duty that could break a Chinese blockade at acceptable cost. To understand how a blockade might play out, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington has run a series of realistic war games under different assumptions, reporting results last month. In some scenarios, Chinese forces interdict ships sailing toward Taiwan but don’t sink them—skirting the threshold of violence that might compel Taiwan’s allies, particularly the United States and Japan, to intervene. In those scenarios, Chinese sailors seize more than 400 Taiwan-bound merchant ships—and Taiwan begins running out of food in two weeks and natural gas in 10 weeks. On the brink of collapse, ‘Taiwan would have to either make concessions to China sufficient to get China to cease its boarding campaign, escalate by using military force against Chinese forces in the exclusion zone or get the United States to intervene on its behalf,’ CSIS reported. A US intervention risks drawing in Japan, too—and, as Chinese, Taiwanese, American and Japanese warships and warplanes tangle over the Pacific shipping lanes, violence is sure to break out. What follows, in several of CSIS’s scenarios, is a convoy war not dissimilar to the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. US warships and patrol aircraft shepherd merchant ships across the Pacific to Japan, where Japanese ships and planes join the effort, fighting through Chinese missile and torpedo attacks to offload the merchantmen in Taiwanese ports. After the initial shock, Taiwanese food and energy imports quickly return to pre-war levels—assuming, of course, Taiwan has hardened its energy grid before the blockade, stored excess oil, coal and natural gas and stocked spare parts. But the campaign is extremely costly—especially for the US Navy, which bears the brunt of the effort in most of CSIS’s simulations. According to the think tank, a convoy war falling just short of a full-scale regional war could cost the Americans 34 warships, including two aircraft carriers, as well as hundreds of aircraft. Nearly 19,000 Americans die. The sinkings amount to more than 10 percent of the overall US fleet, losses that would take decades to make good at current shipbuilding rates. Anticipating exactly this scenario, in 2014 the US Navy launched a new program meant to build a lot of missile-armed frigates, cheaply and fast. In addition to battling enemy fleets on the high seas, the frigates would need to be capable of ‘independent operations,’ according to the US Navy’s 2017 industry solicitation. That’s naval speak for convoy escort duty. The Constellation-class frigates wouldn’t exactly be expendable. But with a target price of $1 billion each and a displacement of just 7,000 tonnes, they would be much cheaper and easier to build than Arleigh Burke-class destroyers of nearly $3 billion and 10,000 tonnes. As recently as last year, the Constellation class was planned to peak at 58 ships, making it the second-most-numerous ship type in US service, after the Burkes. If the US Navy fought a convoy war with a large flotilla of affordable Constellations, and if CSIS’s war games are predictive, the service would still lose a lot of ships. But the loss would sting much less—meaning the fleet could fight through its casualties, onward to eventual victory as more and more merchant ships arrived in Taiwanese ports. But the Constellation program is in trouble. The design was supposed to be simple, inexpensive and easy to build at scale. Instead, it’s become complex, expensive and impossible to build at scale. The type’s displacement has swelled by more than 700 tons as the navy has heaped boutique features onto a licensed Italian hull design. The frigate’s cost has risen by $300 million per ship, owing in part to a desperate labor shortage at American shipyards. After 11 years of work, the US Navy has paid for six of the ships—but doesn’t expect to deploy the first in class until 2029. That’s years later than the original plan. It’s not for no reason that, in their budget proposal for 2026, fleet planners asked for zero additional Constellations. That’s a good sign the frigate program is drifting towards cancellation. There’s nothing in the works to replace it—and the US Navy is almost certain to sail into a possible convoy war without the cheap, easy-to-replace ships that were supposed to make the convoy war affordable for America. ‘Conducting convoys is a basic naval task, but the US Navy is out of practice because convoys have not been a priority mission since the end of the Cold War,’ CSIS warned. ‘Deprioritizing was appropriate for the immediate post–Cold War era, when prospective adversaries had weak naval fleets. It is not appropriate for the current great power era.’ But the US Navy is building ships like there isn’t a possible convoy war on the horizon. This must change. America needs frigates the way Taiwan needs free and navigable seas. David Axe is a journalist and filmmaker in South Carolina, United States.

Ghana Adopts a New Fisheries Law to Curb IUU Fishing,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ghana-adopts-a-new-fisheries-law-to-curb-iuu-fishing,,24/08/2025 22:59:38,,"In the past decade, the scourge of IUU (illegal, unregulated and unreported) fishing in West Africa has grown into a billion-dollar trade, leaving local livelihoods in peril. Poor fisheries governance has seen industrial trawlers encroach in areas designated for artisanal fishermen, which has become a major threat for small pelagic fish. In Ghana for instance, IUU fishing has been estimated to cost the country between $14.4 million and $23.7 million annually. In 2021, the European Union issued a yellow card to Ghana, a warning that the country could lose access to the lucrative European seafood market unless IUU fishing is tackled. It is in this context that Ghana last week adopted a new fisheries and aquaculture law. The legislation was passed by the parliament in July and was signed into law by President John Dramani Mahama on August 19. Ghana’s Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture said that the landmark law is part of a wider government effort to avoid sanctions in key global seafood markets. “The law is crucial in maintaining Ghana’s access to global markets, where seafood has become one of the country’s fastest-growing non-traditional exports,” noted the Ministry. Recent data from the Ministry indicate that Ghana’s seafood exports have reached more than $425 million annually. The campaign group Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), which has been tracking IUU fishing in Ghana, also lauded the law as a bold step of leadership in the region. The Act safeguards livelihoods of over 200,000 small-scale fishers and millions of Ghanaians who depend on artisanal fisheries. A notable reform by the new law is the expansion of the inshore exclusion zone (IEZ), doubling in size from 6 to 12 nautical miles off the coast. The IEZ allows local fishermen space to fish without competition from industrial trawlers. In the past few years, traditional fishers have faced immense competition from Chinese-backed trawlers, especially with the rise of ‘saiko trade’ in Ghana’s fishing industry. Saiko trade was formerly a traditional barter trade system where bycatch was exchanged for farm produce. The trade later transformed, and now involves industrial trawlers transferring frozen stocks of bycatch to small canoe operators for onward sale. The practice is fueling depletion of small pelagics such sardinella, traditionally caught by artisanal fishermen and a staple food for local communities. In the past 15 years, average annual income per artisanal canoe has dropped by as much as 40 percent, according to data by EJF. In addition, over 90 percent of small-scale fishers have reported declining catches. Early this year, Ghana attempted to rein in the industrial trawlers, a move that saw the government suspend fishing licenses of four Chinese vessels. The vessels were accused of unauthorized transshipment at sea (saiko trading) among other violations. The four vessels include Meng Xin 10, Florence 2, Long Xiang 607 and Long Xiang 608. The fishing ban will last for one year.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 15:44:11
Towards a New Data Sharing Regime: Structuring Supply Chain Data,https://maritime-executive.com/article/towards-a-new-data-sharing-regime-structuring-supply-chain-data,,24/08/2025 22:45:01,,"[By Mikael Lind, Wolfgang Lehmacher, Sandra Haraldson, Ernst Hoestra, Boris Kriuk, Richard van der Meulen, and Mark Scheerlinck] Introduction: When Traditional Approaches Fall Short Transport and logistics have always hinged on seamless coordination. Moving goods from point A to point B involves a complex web of actors, including shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, terminal operators, port authorities, customs officials, warehouse operators, and first-mile and last-mile delivery providers. Cargo is typically handed over in nodes from one controlling party to another. It is in these nodes that changes can be applied to the trajectory of the cargo. This requires collaboration. Traditionally, each participant has managed their role in isolation, sharing information only when necessary, primarily through bilateral channels. This model has sustained the industry for decades, yet it increasingly reveals its limitations. In today’s volatile and interconnected world, where disruptions have shifted from exceptions to expectations, fragmented and linear information flows create blind spots, delays, inefficiencies, and fragility. The solution transcends mere technological upgrades; it demands a fundamental reimagining of how we organize and interpret vast, disparate streams of supply chain data. Rather than scattered exchanges, what’s needed is a collaborative data-sharing regime that imposes order upon chaos, delivering shared visibility and situational awareness across the entire ecosystem. Such a framework empowers actors not just to be informed, but to act decisively, converting raw data into strategic insight. The result: enhanced coordination, resilience, and performance. This is an ambition that the Virtual Watch Tower (VWT), a multi-stakeholder community co-creating a digital, federated architecture and solution as a public good, pursues in its approach to data sharing for better disruption and carbon footprint management. The Inherent Limits of Traditional Data Sharing In the traditional landscape, data exchanges are direct and narrowly focused, typically confined to transactions between two actors. A shipper updates a carrier. A carrier informs a forwarder. A terminal operator alerts a trucking company. Each communication serves immediate operational needs, with a transactional brevity that sacrifices holistic understanding. This approach bears three critical shortcomings: The consequence is a fragmented patchwork of data streams, leaving stakeholders “starving for data but lacking insight.” Embracing a Collaborative Data Sharing Regime A transformative alternative lies in a Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM) approach. Instead of Actor #1 transmitting updates separately to Actors #2 and #3, data enters a shared, trusted pool accessible to all authorized participants (Figure 1). This shift from bilateral exchanges to an ecosystem-wide platform enables real-time shared visibility. Figure 1: Fundamentals on Data Sharing: From bilateral to ecosystem-based data exchanges This methodological leap unlocks profound benefits: In essence, collaboration brings clarity and meaning to the raw data flowing through supply chains. A Four-Layer Framework to Bring Order and Insight At the core of this new regime is a systematic model (Figure 2) that organizes fragmented information into three interlocking layers, which are wrapped within a fourth evolutionary layer that enables secure and trusted ecosystem-wide data sharing. Each layer enriches data with context and purpose, turning raw signals into orchestrated decisions. This framework relies on establishing common semantics at each layer, ensuring that data shared between planning, progress, and analysis is coherent and interpretable by every actor. Only with agreed-upon definitions and structures can insights be generated and acted upon reliably across the supply chain. Figure 2: Layered data sharing framework 1. Transport Planning Layer – Sharing Intentions The planning layer looks forward. It captures actors’ intentions, the planned container movements, vessel unloading, and truck dispatches, offering a dynamic view of expected operations. Shared plans enable proactive coordination: for example, a delay of a ship leads to a new plan and prompts terminal berth reallocation and trucking schedule adjustments. The value of the shared plans also depends on standardized representations of intentions and schedules. 2. Transport Progress Layer – Documenting What Has Happened This layer logs real-time data, including timestamps of events such as “container loaded,” “vessel departed,” or “truck arrived at gate.” Leveraging Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors and system signals, it constructs a reliable, shared timeline, replacing isolated updates with a common factual record. Documenting events requires agreed-upon event codes and timestamp formats. 3. Transport Analysis Layer – Illuminating Insights Here, analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) synthesize data from planning and progress layers to simulate deviations, estimate delays, forecast arrivals, and even compute emissions. This layer distils streams of raw data into actionable insights, offering foresight, risk awareness, and performance metrics that anchor decision-making. Helpful analytical insights arise from consistently formatted and meaningful raw data. 4. Transport Data Sharing Ecosystem Layer – Wrapping and Enabling Across Layers Surrounding and enabling these three layers is the data sharing ecosystem itself. This outer layer ensures that data flows securely, transparently, and with trust throughout the entire network. It enforces access controls and sovereignty policies, allowing each participant to determine who sees what, while supporting seamless interoperability and fairness. A trusted sharing environment must enforce semantic consistency as a basis for interoperability. This ecosystem is not merely a container but a living framework that facilitates collaboration across planning, progress, and analysis, amplifying the value created within each layer and fostering resilient, coordinated supply chain networks. Due to this systemic approach, the integrity of data management also enables a fully controlled Return Cycle, which, based on current Producer Responsibility rules, should be considered a major additional benefit. How the Layers Synchronize: From Fragmentation to Elegance Imagine a container moving from a factory in Asia to a warehouse in Europe: Throughout this cycle, the data sharing ecosystem secures and governs the data flow to the port, trucking company, and other parties downstream , ensuring that access and usage rights are respected while enabling authorized actors to consume and engage with the same accurate and timely information. This orchestration transforms once fragmented, reactive data into a continuous, coherent, and actionable stream. Trust Reinforced by Data Sovereignty Fear of losing control has long stifled data sharing. This regime addresses such concerns head-on: sovereignty is preserved. Each actor defines what to share, with whom, and under which conditions, supported by distributed platforms such as federated systems and blockchain. No single entity dominates; instead, information is structured and shared across the ecosystem with embedded permissions. Trust flourishes when fairness and transparency underpin data governance. Why Action Is More Urgent Than Ever Today’s supply chains generate unprecedented data volumes. Every scan, movement, and transaction emits digital signals. Yet without structure, this mass merely manifests as noise. Simultaneously, global volatility, from pandemics to geopolitical tensions and climate events, demands swift, coordinated reactions. The solution IS NOT more data, but smarter, better-organized data. The four-layer framework provides a roadmap, turning disjointed signals into shared understanding and transforming data chaos into resilient coordination. Aligning Incentives for Sustainable Data Sharing Incentives must align across participants for this model to succeed. The logical starting point is the shipper, whose inputs, like shipment itineraries and booking details, anchor the shared structure. Operators, terminals, and carriers then contribute data as part of service fulfilment. This reciprocity creates mutual value: clarity generated by others enhances each actor’s operations. Over time, structured data-sharing will evolve from a competitive advantage to an industry imperative. Conclusion: From Data Fragmentation to Meaningful Coordination The logistics sector has historically amassed an abundance of data but suffered from a paucity of shared understanding. Traditional fragmented approaches yield isolated signals that obscure the bigger picture. What is required goes beyond technology: a fundamentally new way to structure, interpret, and act on existing data. The collaborative four-layer model achieves this by: Together, these layers weave disconnected updates into a shared narrative, trusted and actionable by all participants. A vital first step is cultivating shared situational awareness. Structured data enables actors to perceive the broader ecosystem and receive early alerts about emerging disruptions, such as delays, capacity shortages, or congestion, empowering proactive responses. However, structure alone is insufficient. The value emerges when visibility translates into action: rebooking when capacity tightens, alternative routing amid congestion, and emissions calculators to align disruption management with sustainability goals. These services transform awareness into resilience. The message is unequivocal: collaboration is not optional; it is essential—a vision lived by VWT. Only through collective order, insight, and trust can supply chains transcend fragmented data to achieve meaningful coordination, moving from reactive firefighting toward proactive, resilient logistics. By moving data towards a public good, VWT translates data-sharing into a solution that benefits all.

With the help of external firefighting teams and equipment brought out to the ship while it was off Africa, Maersk has reported that the fire was contained. The company released two pictures taken on Friday, August 22, when a supply vessel reached the scene with additional firefighting equipment. There is no visible fire damage to any of the boxes aboard what appears to be a heavily laden vessel. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU. “After an inspection of affected areas of the vessel and careful consideration of all aspects together with authorities and class, it was deemed safe that Marie Maersk resumes her eastbound voyage around Cape of Good Hope on Sunday. Her next port of destination is under final review, and we will inform as soon as it has been decided,” Maersk reported. Marie Maersk with no visible fire damage to the containers aboard (Maersk) The containership had spent a week lying off the west coast of Liberia after smoke was first detected coming from containers on August 13. The ship was moved closer to the coast so that fire equipment could be brought out. Late last week, the ship rounded the western coast of Africa and was then met with additional supplies offshore near Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire). A supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment reached the Marie Maersk on Friday evening and transferred special equipment onboard on Saturday, August 23. The AIS signal for the ship shows it now underway with a declared destination of Cape Town, South Africa. Its routing called for a stop in Malaysia before proceeding to China. The company has repeated said the navigational equipment and machinery was not damaged, and the ship was stable. Maersk reports that the external firefighting team will remain on board, and “special measures” have been put in place to ensure a safe journey. An intermediate stop might be implemented, Maersk said, depending on the optimal place for handling the damaged containers and to mitigate onward disruptions in its network. Contingencies are in place in case the planned journey needs to be revised en route. The company has not advised on the location of the boxes that were smoking or the nature of the cargo. In general, mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo is one of the most frequent dangers cited for the containership. Maersk has said the full extent of the damage would not be known until the vessel reaches a port and unloads containers from the area where the fire was located.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

The reports initially placed the drones at various points around the region, with Drozdenko reporting that at least 10 drones were destroyed on Saturday, prompting him to issue a warning for citizens to “refrain from being near industrial zones and enterprises, as well as visiting public places.” On Sunday, August 24, Drozdenko acknowledged that at least 10 drones had attacked the port of Ust-Luga, although he said they were all destroyed. Debris from a drone was, however, reported to have caused a fire at the Novatek terminal. The reports said there were no casualties. The extent of the damage is unclear, and many of the photos being posted online are from a 2024 fire at the plant. Drozdenko said the fire had been “localized” and that the fuel tanks were not damaged. By Sunday afternoon, the report was that the fire at Ust-Luga had been extinguished and Novatek was starting repairs and restoration work.

Some 600 miles from Ukraine. https://t.co/948Ma4zBEz pic.twitter.com/YTlQPjaETo It is believed the gas processing equipment was struck, taking the plant offline. Some reports are suggesting it could take months to repair, which would be a major blow to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Novatek has been operating the facility, which is located about 70 miles west of St. Petersburg, since 2013. Reports are that it handles more than seven million tons of gas condensate as well as more than four million tons of heavy and light oil. It is also a supplier of marine and jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel fuel. The daring attack was staged more than 600 miles from Ukraine and was part of a larger assault on the energy system. Russia’s defense ministry is saying 95 drones were launched across 14 regions and all were downed with minor damage. It acknowledged 13 drones destroyed over Ust-Luga, as well as some damage to a nuclear power plant. Russia has been striking Ukraine’s fuel import and distribution network and facilities. Last week, a tanker was reportedly damaged while unloading at the port of Izmail on the Danube.",Maritime Executive,25/08/2025 21:31:07

Two Canadian First Nations Buy Strategic Mining Port Terminal,https://maritime-executive.com/article/two-canadian-first-nations-buy-strategic-mining-port-terminal,,26/08/2025 03:00:06,,"In a first-of-its-kind transaction for Canada’s British Columbia Province, two First Nations have formed a partnership with a Canadian logistics company and will acquire the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal located in northwestern British Columbia along the U.S.-Canada border. It comes as there is an increasing push to tap Canada’s minerals and resources for economic advancement. ""This isn't just about us purchasing the first Indigenous majority-owned port in British Columbia's history,"" Andrew Robinson, chief executive officer of the Nisga'a Lisims Government, told The Canadian Press. “It's about economic sovereignty, reconciliation, and ensuring that wealth generated from our lands directly benefits our people and generations to come.” The Nisga’a Nation and the Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership are partnering with Arrow Transportation Systems to launch the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. The new group is also consolidating the regional trucking operations of Arrow Transport’s Stewart Trucking Division and Tahltan-Arrow Transport to provide bulk transportation and logistics solutions in the Tahltan Territory. They note that Northwest BC is home to more than half the province’s exploration and mining sector. They believe the new partnership will provide improved access to deliver critical minerals from mine to market. The Port of Stewart is Canada’s most northerly ice-free port located to the north of Prince Rupert and supplying critical access to both British Columbia and Alberta. It is 80 to 90 miles from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the Portland Canal and provides support for the logging, mining, and exploration operations in the region. “Together, we are making history,” said Kerry Carlick, President, Tahltan Central Government. “The acquisition of this strategic asset will drive economic growth, create opportunities, and strengthen our nations’ self-determination.” The terminal primarily handles ore and logging with a breakbulk wharf and RoRo capabilities for barges. It can accommodate vessels up to approximately 50,000 dwt for the transport of ore and logs. One of the key customers is Newmont, which operates the Brucejacket and Red Chris mines in the indigenous communities’ territories and transports copper concentrate to market from the port. Newmont is strengthening its ties with the First Nations to support long-term growth of the port as a regional hub and provide the port’s new owners commercial certainty needed to move forward with the investments. The Province of British Columbia has also provided a C$5 million (US$3.6 million) grant to the two First Nations to support the purchase of the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. It is part of the government’s Northwest Strategy to support mining development and the indigenous peoples.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Master Boat Builders Expands Shipbuilding Operations,https://maritime-executive.com/article/master-boat-builders-expands-shipbuilding-operations,,26/08/2025 02:08:19,,"[By Master Boat Builders] Master Boat Builders, Inc. (Master Boat), an internationally recognized vessel and workboat manufacturer, today announced that it has invested $7.8 million to modernize and expand its shipbuilding operations in Mobile County by adding a new fabrication shop and floating drydock. The expansion project creates 85 new jobs, adding to Master Boat’s skilled workforce of more than 300 workers and further contributes to Mobile County’s strength in shipbuilding and maritime services. “This investment is about more than just expanding our ability to build more high-quality vessels. It underscores our commitment to increasing American shipbuilding capacity and we’re doing it right here along America’s Gulf Coast in Mobile County,” said Garrett Rice, President of Master Boat Builders. “By modernizing our facilities and growing our skilled workforce, we’re positioning our team to deliver critical vessels that support U.S. commerce and industry, all while training the next generation of American shipbuilders.” “Mobile’s maritime industry continues to thrive, and Master Boat’s investment underscores our region’s leadership in shipbuilding,” said Bradley Byrne, Mobile Chamber president and CEO. “By creating new jobs, retaining existing ones and investing in workforce development, this project is a powerful example of how our business community is growing alongside our thriving port and maritime economy.” The expansion includes the construction of a new fabrication building, a floating dry dock to support new harbor tug contracts, workforce training initiatives and infrastructure improvements. “Master Boat Builders is a 45-year-old, third generation, locally owned shipbuilder located in the Bayou. They have employed thousands of people over that span from local communities and currently employ over 300 people. If we can’t incentivize and support the growth of a business like Master, we shouldn’t be incentivizing anyone!” said District 3 Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt. “This expansion not only secures and creates jobs for local families, but it also reinforces the fact that Mobile County is a leader in shipbuilding and maritime innovation and will be for years to come.” This project also supports the region’s ongoing workforce development and training initiatives, reflecting the growing demand for skilled talent within the maritime and shipbuilding sectors. “Master Boat’s expansion highlights the continued momentum of Alabama’s maritime industry and reinforces Mobile County’s position as a hub for shipbuilding and repair,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “This investment not only creates quality jobs but also strengthens the region’s capacity to support a vital sector of our state’s economy.” Work on this expansion began October of 2024 and is expected to be fully operational by October of this year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Mediterranean NGO Reports Libya Shot and Damaged its Rescue Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mediterranean-ngo-reports-libya-shot-and-damaged-its-rescue-boat,,26/08/2025 01:59:48,,"The NGO SOS Mediterranee released details on an encounter in the Mediterranean on Sunday, August 24, in which it says the Libyan Coast Guard opened fire on its ship and continued to attack the ship for up to 20 minutes. The group released pictures showing shattered bridge windows among other damage, which it reports the Libyans inflicted on the small rescue boat Ocean Viking. SOS Mediterranee has been operating the Ocean Viking, a former North Sea supply vessel for the oil and gas industry, since 2019 under charter from the International Red Cross. Built in 1986 and now registered in Norway, the ship was outfitted with three rigid rescue boats and a medical facility. The group reports it made two rescues on August 23, taking aboard 47 people, including nine unaccompanied minors, who it says are mostly from war-torn Somalia. The Italians had ordered the Ocean Viking to head to Marina di Carrara, a 700 nautical mile trip that would have required 3.5 days, but they received permission to remain in the Mediterranean searching for a third boat with migrants. The Ocean Viking, they report, was 40 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast when they were confronted by a patrol boat on Sunday afternoon. According to their account of the situation, the Libyans first demanded that the vessel leave the area and head north immediately. They said the instructions were radioed in English and Arabic. Today at 3pm, the #OceanViking has been deliberately and violently attacked in intl. waters by the Libyan Coast Guard, who fired hundreds of shots at our ship. The 87 survivors and crew on board were not wounded. We are currently working on a detailed reconstruction of events. pic.twitter.com/i8RkuYI1ep Without warning or an ultimatum, SOS Mediterranee reports that two soldiers aboard the Libyan boat began shooting at the Ocean Viking. They are claiming the patrol boat circled the vessel, shooting for up to 20 minutes. Four windows on the bridge were broken, multiple antennas were destroyed, and several bullets struck and damaged the three fast rescue boats, along with other equipment. None of the migrants or crew were injured. The Ocean Viking issued a mayday and called NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian. They report that they were told an Italian navy ship was the closest NATO asset, but it did not return calls. The captain of the Ocean Viking started his vessel for Syracuse, Italy, but the authorities later ordered them to sail to Augusta. SOS Mediterranee is demanding a full investigation into the incident. It is also pointing out that the vessel that attacked them was one of two patrol boats Italy gifted to Libya in June 2023. There have been similar incidents in the past with the Libyan Coast Guard and the rescue vessels. This one, however, was more aggressive and longer. The group says its volunteers and the survivors were clearly threatened and felt in serious danger.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
U.S. Coast Guard Sets Record With 34-Tonne Cocaine Offload,https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-sets-record-with-34-tonne-cocaine-offload,,26/08/2025 01:48:45,,"The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Hamilton has offloaded a record-setting 34 tonnes of cocaine at the pier in Port Everglades, a quantity of the drug rarely seen in one place. It is the service's largest single cocaine offload on record, and the Coast Guard estimated its value at a (much-reduced) price of just $470 million. An overabundance of South American cocaine exports have pushed down prices in export markets, increasing volume and reducing its value at the same time. USCGC Hamilton offloaded cocaine collected in 19 separate interdictions near Aruba, Haiti, Venezuela, Curacao, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Bonaire, and a variety of high-seas locations in the Eastern Pacific, from Ecuador to Mexico. Six different Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy vessels participated in the seizures, but Hamilton played the largest role, conducting 11 interdictions and seizing a record 47,000 pounds of cocaine. Cocaine bust off Bonaire, facilitated by destroyer USS Cole (USCG) “Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,” said Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer of Hamilton. “The commitment and sacrifice of our deployed service members and their families, who forego time together for the protection of our Nation, are to be celebrated.” A large share of the cocaine traffic through the Caribbean is destined for Europe, not the United States. European customers account for about one fifth of global cocaine demand, and have historically paid a premium for the drug. The Coast Guard priced out the shipment's U.S. wholesale value at about $14,000 per kilo, a fraction of the 2024 EU average of about $35,000 per kilo; EU street and wholesale prices have fallen since the first quarter of 2025, according to multiple European media reports, driven down by an abundant supply and a price war between cartels.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Zim Confirms Turkey’s Immediate Ban on Shipping Associated with Israel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/zim-confirms-turkey-s-immediate-ban-on-shipping-associated-with-israel,,26/08/2025 00:58:53,,"Zim confirmed the earlier reports that Turkey has begun turning away ships associated with Israel. The company, which is the ninth-largest container carrier, reports it is rerouting ships scheduled to call at Turkish ports and working on a mitigation plan. In a stock exchange filing on Monday, August 25, Zim writes, “It received a notice from the Turkish Port Authorities through the company’s local agent in Turkey, that as a result of a new regulation adopted in Turkey, vessels that are either owned, managed or operated by an entity related to Israel will not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports.” The change was said to be effective immediately as of last Friday. The Globes newspaper in Israel reports that one of the company’s ships was turned away from Istanbul last Friday. It writes that the vessel was forced to proceed to Piraeus, Greece, and that there is no clear solution for the cargo scheduled to be loaded or unloaded in Istanbul. The new regulation also impacts all vessels that are carrying military cargo destined to Israel, which Zim says it was told would not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports. Also, Turkish-flagged vessels are prohibited from calling at Israeli ports. Globes reports that while it is an expansion of the trade embargo Turkey imposed 15 months ago, it says shipping companies are still waiting for clear instructions from the Turkish government. It says other major carriers, such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, are seeking clear instructions. A ship’s flag is said not to be a guarantee that it will be permitted into a Turkish port. It is not the first country to bar Israeli shipping, for example, Malaysia took a similar step in December 2023, but it is a minor trading partner with Israel. Turkey and Israel had a large trade flow, and even after the embargo, trade continued between the countries. The ban comes as Zim has already been under pressure. Last week, the company reported a 15 percent decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2025 and a 38 percent decline in earnings (EBITDA) for the quarter. Carried container volume was down six percent in the second quarter to 895,000 TEU, but box volume for the six months was up year-over-year to 1.84 million TEU. Management cited the company’s agility and ability to respond to the challenging market conditions. Based on its outlook, it raised its midpoint guidance for the full year 2025 despite the softness in the quarter. Today, it however, warned that if Turkey’s ban remains unchanged, it is expected to negatively impact financial and operating results. Recently, there have been market rumors that management was exploring a possible buyout of Zim with an investment group. Zim went public in January 2021 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
NTSB: Barge Grounded in Prince William Sound After ATB's Lines Parted,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-barge-grounded-in-prince-william-sound-because-atb-s-lines-parted,,26/08/2025 00:41:25,,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the results of its investigation into the loss of the barge Cordova Provider, which ran aground in Prince William Sound and suffered so much damage that it was declared a total loss. Cordova Provider began life as an ice-class oil recovery barge, but in 2005 it was modified with a notch to serve as one half of a unique ATB. The other half, the tug Krystal Sea, was built at the Western Towboat yard at the same time. Instead of coupler pins like those found on an Articouple or Intercon system, the Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider fit together with a wedge-and-recess system that had no moving parts. Three wedges on the tug - one on the bow, one to port and one to starboard - would line up with corresponding recesses within the notch at the stern of the barge. Changes in relative draft could be compensated for by backing out of the notch and re-entering at a different set of recesses. Instead of a positive mechanical connection, the Krystal Sea was held in the slot by four breast lines (push lines) running from the barge to winches on the stern of the towboat, much like an inland towboat. When Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider were built, the lines and bridles were steel wire rope; the operator later exchanged the wire rope for Dyneema soft lines, which were lighter and safer for the crew to handle over the side. Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider operated in this configuration to move breakbulk cargo around Prince William Sound, within sheltered waters. On the morning of January 10, 2025, the ATB got under way from Valdez, headed across the sound for Cordova. The forecast called for winds of 45 knots, consistent with wintertime weather along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Six-foot seas were expected in the sound, rising to 10 feet after midnight. The ATB's call in Cordova was completed swiftly, and the ATB departed for Whittier at 2110. By 0200 hours the next morning, as Krystal Sea crossed the middle of the sound, seas rose to 4-6 feet, with wind and waves on the port quarter of the tug - typical conditions, according to the crew. At 0250, the mate on watch heard a line snap, followed by three more. All four of the Dyneema lines that held the tug and barge together had parted in the middle, and the Cordova Provider was adrift. The master came to the bridge and maneuvered to see if there was a way to regain control of the barge, but the surface conditions made this too dangerous to attempt. Instead, the Coast Guard put the master in contact with the operator of the escort tug Latouche, moored nearby. The Latouche arrived on scene at 0550 hours and attempted to retrieve the barge by getting a line onto a bitt on its stern. The crew succeeded, but the line parted shortly after. Latouche was forced to give up the chase as Cordova Provider drifted into dangerous shallows off Axel Lind Island. The barge then ran aground, sustained extensive hull damage on the rocks, and partially sank. It was later refloated, towed offshore and disposed of through sinking in deeper water. Investigators' focus turned to the lines that connected the two vessels as an ATB unit. The operator had switched to soft shackles and Dyneema pennant lines in 2023-4, and the captain had inspected the rigging about five days before the casualty, finding nothing amiss. After the casualty, a technician from the firm that assembled the lines determined that they were in fair to good condition, with minor abrasion. Three had parted in the middle of the pennant section, and one parted at the soft shackle. All components were rated for a 100,000-pound breaking strength. NTSB concluded that the lines likely parted due to shock loading, with cascading failure after the first line parted. As the tug had served in similar conditions before, the reason for the break on this particular trip is unknown.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Northern Lights Injects First CO2 in Subsea Storage Well,https://maritime-executive.com/article/northern-lights-injects-first-co2-in-subsea-storage-well,,25/08/2025 23:51:55,,"The pioneering Northern Lights project has injected its first shipment of carbon dioxide for long-term storage in a subsea reservoir off the coast of Norway, launching a long-anticipated service backed by Equinor (as operator), TotalEnergies, Shell and the Norwegian government. “With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” said the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, in a statement Monday. Northern Lights is the first commercial-scale project of its kind, and it is the backbone of a constellation of Norwegian carbon-capture initiatives. The offshore reservoir serves as the final destination for carbon from a variety of onshore industries, notably the Heidelberg cement plant in the town of Brevik and the Hafslund waste incineration plant in Oslo. Other future users include Yara, Stockholm Exergi and Orsted, among others, through the provision of long-distance CO2 shipping. An initial small-scale liquefied CO2 shipping service is provided by K Line. Now that Northern Lights is up and running, its backers want to expand it rapidly. The current capacity is just 1.5 million tonnes per year, about the same as the annual emissions of 320,000 non-electric cars. With backing from the EU, its owners plan to add more infrastructure to more than triple that number to 5.0 million tonnes per year. This second development phase should be completed and ready for operation in late 2028. The scope includes an additional jetty, nine new storage tanks, and more injection wells. Over the long term, Equinor wants to have 30-50 million tonnes a year of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035, primarily in Europe and in the U.S.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Italian Coast Guard Responds as Mega MSC Cruise Ship Loses Propulsion Power,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-responds-as-mega-msc-cruise-ship-loses-propulsion-power,,25/08/2025 23:20:27,,"MSC World Europa, one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a reported 8,500 people aboard, lost propulsion early Monday, August 25, off the coast of Italy. The incident drew wide media attention with sensational reports saying it had grounded or crashed. The Guardia Costiera responded to the ship, and it was emphasized that the vessel was never in any physical danger. Introduced in 2022 as the first cruise ship to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, the ship was making a week-long cruise circuit in the Western Mediterranean and sailing between Genoa and Naples when, according to passengers, the vessel stopped at approximately 0530 Monday morning. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard control center at approximately 0730, and two patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched to survey the situation. At 215,863 gross tons, the massive 1,094-foot (333-meter) vessel is reported to have a total of 8,585 people aboard, including 6,496 passengers on an end of summer cruise and 2,089 crewmembers. Some of the passengers were due to disembark today in Naples, and others were waiting to join the ship. The Coast Guard placed officers aboard the ship to survey the situation and reported it was told that the ship was experiencing an electrical problem with its propulsion. The ship is one of the largest to be fueled with LNG and uses Azipods for propulsion. It was built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and is second in size only to Royal Caribbean International’s sister ships Icon and Star of the Seas. MSC introduced a second ship of the class this year and has ordered four more World Class ships. Passengers were reported calm while the ship was drifting approximately eight miles off the coast of the Italian island of Ponza. The ship was able to continue to run its generators and was maintaining passenger services. Two tugs from the ports of Gioia Tauro and Naples were dispatched, and plans were being made to tow the ship, if necessary, the approximately 50 miles to Naples. However, by early afternoon, MSC Cruises was reporting that the crew had been able to initially restore partial propulsion. The Coast Guard did a further inspection, and the ship was moving at 15 knots with a Coast Guard escort to Naples. It docked at 2100 local time on Monday night. MSC said technicians would continue to repair and inspect the cruise ship. Passengers were proceeding with the disembarkation and embarkation. The plan called for the ship to resume its cruise on Tuesday, sailing for Messina.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
"Finnish Prosecutors Demand Jail Time for Captain, Officers of Shadow Tanker",https://maritime-executive.com/article/finnish-prosecutors-demand-jail-time-for-captain-officers-of-shadow-tanker,,25/08/2025 22:31:48,,"The trial for the captain and two senior officers of the shadow fleet tanker Eagle S began on Monday, August 25, in the Helsinki District Court. They are facing charges ranging from aggravated sabotage and aggravated telecommunications interference to lesser charges of vandalism and endangering public safety. The trial stems from the December 25, 2024, damage by the 74,000 dwt tanker Eagle S to the undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia, as well as four telecommunications cables. Prosecutors told the court that the laden tanker, which was registered in the Cook Islands, dragged its anchor for a distance of at least 55 miles in the Baltic. For the first time, they also said in court that the vessel appeared to slow as it passed over the cables, and they contended that if the Finnish authorities had not intervened and seized the tanker, it would have done more damage as it continued its trip. The prosecution is reported to be demanding jail time for the master of the vessel, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, a Georgia national, Robert Egizaryan, another Georgian who was the first officer, and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, an Indian who was the second officer on the vessel. The Finnish news outlet Yle reports the prosecution called for sentences of two and a half years in prison, which is near the minimum of two years under the law. The maximum for aggravated sabotage (criminal mischief) is 10 years in prison, while the aggravated charges for interfering with telecommunications are up to five years. They are saying the charges are “aggravated” because their actions were intentional and deliberate. Prosecutors assert the crew was required to operate the vessel safely. The three individuals are pleading not guilty to the charges. The captain speaking to the Swedish Yle last week said it was a “maritime accident.” Defense lawyers reiterated the claim that it was an accident. The captain claimed to Yle that no alarms sounded and that they did not sense changes in the ship. In court, it was revealed that the ship stopped at midday due to an engine problem and was experiencing heavy weather in the Baltic. They have not said when the anchor was deployed, but they are saying a broken safety pin could have caused it to come loose. The court was also told that the braking system for the anchor was heavily rusted and inoperable. The Vessel Traffic Service had made an inquiry to the ship during the afternoon, at which time they said the second officer denied that the anchor was down. It was not until 1845 that they were told they were dragging something on the seafloor and instructed to raise the anchor. The officers claimed that a check of the mooring deck at dinner time that night was not safe because of the weather. The court will also have to take up the question of jurisdiction. The UAE-based shipping company that managed the Eagle S contends Finland lacks authority because the damage happened in international waters and points out that Finland was not endangered because it sends power to Estonia. During the hearing today, the court was told a manager from the shipping company had instructed the captain to delete a report showing the vessel had crossed over the damaged cables. The prosecution is also asking the court to consider compensation for the damage and repairs. The Finnish and Estonian companies have said it cost them more than $70 million to repair the cables, which were out of service for months. Finland conducted a Port State inspection on the Eagle S at the beginning of January and reported 53 deficiencies ranging from fire safety to structural conditions and violations of the Master Labor Contract for seafarers. They reported that radar and firefighting equipment were inoperable and problems in the cargo pump room. The vessel was detained in Finland for 53 days before it was permitted to sail. The incident raised awareness of the dangers to the subsea infrastructure and the issues with the shadow fleet. Baltic and Scandinavian countries increased their monitoring of the shadow fleet and began challenging the vessels on documentation, including insurance coverage. The countries were also successful in getting NATO to deploy additional resources to the Baltic and North Sea. Russia has responded, denying knowledge of the vessels’ actions, and calling the Western efforts piracy, vowing to defend the shadow fleet tankers.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 04:42:59
Egypt and Greece Reject Turkish-Libyan EEZ Claim,https://maritime-executive.com/article/egypt-and-greece-reject-turkish-libyan-eez-claim,,25/08/2025 22:31:21,,"Egypt and Greece have rejected a bilateral accord first tabled in 2019, which seeks to establish a maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya in the Mediterranean. The accord appears likely to be signed up to by the government in eastern Libya, having been agreed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government in western Libya six years ago. The purpose of the accord is to facilitate oil exploration, by establishing a boundary within the sea corridor claimed by Libya and Turkey. When the accord was originally tabled in 2019, it was met with almost universal rejection. It was regarded as a breach of the International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), by the United States, the EU, Russia and the Arab League amongst many, but in particular by Greece, Egypt and Cyprus because the Libyan-Turkish corridor was superimposed over their own UNCLOS-backed claims for 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones. The Turkish-Libyan accord is likely to be hotly contested, and it is not clear what lies behind the revived claim. It is possible that some of those who were originally vehemently opposed to the carve-up have now switched sides, conjecturing that under the Trump administration, potential economic gains could outweigh previous political understandings and the potential breaches of UNCLOS - and also believing that the revival of the Libyan-Turkish claim could become part of a settlement of Libya’s long-running political crisis. Turkey is already in dispute with Greece and Cyprus over exploitation of oil and gas reserves to the south of Cyprus, among many other issues. Greece and Turkey (and Turkey's Ottoman predecessors) have spent centuries contesting territorial control over the region, most recently including the partition of Cyprus in 1974 and the ongoing dispute over islands and maritime zones in the Aegean.

"Trump: ""We're Going to be Buying Ships From South Korea""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-we-re-going-to-be-buying-ships-from-south-korea,,26/08/2025 06:50:56,,"Shipbuilding was at the top of the agenda in talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, and the outcomes included a pledge from Trump to buy ships from Korea. In hopes of securing lower U.S. tariff rates and keeping the multibillion-dollar Korean auto industry competitive on the U.S. market, Seoul pledged an investment of $150 billion in America's shipbuilding sector. The bid was successful: Korea won a 10-point reduction in its tariff rate, putting its manufacturers on the same footing as competitors in Japan and the EU. To get the Trump administration to seal the deal, Korean trade officials came up with a slogan - ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. This gesture won the attention of the administration's trade negotiators, yielding a more favorable 15 percent tariff on Korean cars, computer chips and other exports. Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung was the first major bilateral press conference after the deal was concluded, and it appeared to yield a result that fulfills the hopes of Korean yards as well: an American intention to buy Korean hulls. ""We're going to be buying ships from South Korea,"" Trump said. ""We love their ships."" Trump told reporters that in the long term, ""we're also going to have them make ships here with our people, using our people, and we're going to go back into the shipbuilding business again."" As for timing, Trump emphasized that ""it takes a while"" and that ""shipbuilding is a tough one to start."" In addition to favoring Korean ships, Trump has also spoken highly of Finnish shipbuilding. Earlier this year, he told reporters that he has negotiated personally with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on the terms for purchasing used and new icebreakers from a non-U.S. shipyard. Two Finland-based yards, Helsinki Shipyard and Rauma, are said to be bidding for a program to build medium icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard (in cooperation with local partners in the United States). Korean state investment with U.S. guidance Coinciding with the Trump-Lee meeting on Monday, the U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management announced a partnership with Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai to launch a new ""maritime investment strategy"" focused on American shipbuilding opportunities. The new strategy, Cerberus Maritime, will also look for investment possibilities in the American maritime industry writ large, including maritime logistics, supply chains, infrastructure, ports and technology. HD Hyundai will provide shipbuilding expertise and serve as an anchor investor in the partnership. In addition, it will bring with it the Korean government's state sponsor for shipping and shipbuilding, Korea Development Bank (KDB). The policy bank is known as a lender of last resort for Korean shipyards; it was the largest shareholder in DSME before it arranged the yard's sale to Hanwha in 2022. In its investment role with HD Hyundai and Cerberus, KDB will ""facilitate investments into the Cerberus Maritime strategy"" in recognition of the initiative's importance to Korean national objectives. Cerberus and HD Hyundai have worked together in shipbuilding before. In 2022, Cerberus bought the former Hanjin-owned shipyard in Subic Bay, the biggest yard in the Philippines. Cerberus has leased out part of the space to HD Hyundai, which is investing $550 million at the site and plans to begin building product tankers there by early next year.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44
Whale Atlas: An Easy-to-Use Mapping Tool for Whale-Safer Global Navigation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/whale-atlas-an-easy-to-use-mapping-tool-for-whale-safer-global-navigation,,26/08/2025 04:48:00,,"2025 has been a tumultuous year for large whales in California and beyond. At least eight gray whales have been killed by ship strikes just in the Bay Area. While the majority of ship strikes go unobserved and undetected, researchers estimate that 80 endangered whales are fatally struck each year off the West Coast of the U.S. This reality was the impetus behind creating a new online portal which offers digitized details of whale conservation zones to make it easier for mariners planning multinational transits to understand and cooperate with whale-protection measures. In many places throughout the world, high-traffic shipping zones overlap with whale foraging areas and migration routes. Marine managers aim to reduce the risk of strikes by slowing ships down or asking them to avoid certain areas at certain times of the year. For the past ten years, Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies (BWBS) has engaged shipping companies, asking them to reduce their speeds voluntarily to a whale-safer level of 10 knots or less off the coast of California during peak whale migratory season. Programs like BWBS, which verifies cooperation with NOAA’s voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) requests, work collaboratively with industry, and have been proven to be effective - reducing fatal strike risk by 50%. Where and when vessels reduce speeds is just as important as the slowing down itself. Resource managers use the best available science to determine the placement and timing of VSR zones. Video credit: Katherine Brook; vessel and whale footage by Adam Ernster Advancing global awareness and collaboration around whale protection measures Whale conservation programs and protection measures centered on reducing shipping impacts on whales exist around the world, including in the Strait of Gibraltar; Hellenic Trench; Bering and Salish Seas; Costa Rica; Gulfs of Panama, Hauraki and Saint Lawrence; and the Canadian Arctic. In 2023 and 2024 the World Shipping Council released a first-of-its-kind Whale Chart Report that compiled and outlined whale protection measures across the globe in order to raise awareness to mariners of opportunities to reduce biodiversity impacts. This included VSR zones, Areas to be Avoided (ATBAs), and Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), all aimed at directing vessel traffic to either reduce speeds within or stay away from critical whale habitat areas. Seeing an opportunity to make this valuable information more interactive and user-friendly, California Marine Sanctuary Foundation (CMSF) and the BWBS team developed an online platform to enhance how mariners access and engage with the information critical to understanding and cooperating with whale protection measures. CMSF is proud to introduce “Whale Atlas: A Mariners Guide to Whale-Safer Shipping” This new, online portal showcases digitized whale conservation zones and protection measures relevant to maritime shipping activities. It houses information on: Whale Atlas with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary selected, part of the NOAA voluntary VSR request, and Blue Whales Blue Skies program in California Whale conservation zones represent areas where mariners are requested to either: reduce speeds or avoid important habitats for a few months or year-round. Whale Atlas provides this information, as well as the source/administering agency, so mariners can zoom in and out of relevant geographies, learn about opportunities to operate more sustainably, download layers in relevant formats, and incorporate measures into their transit plans. CMSF and the BWBS team will regularly update the data to ensure that the conservation zones are current as guidance, data, and priority zones evolve. Maritime shipping is a global industry, and Whale Atlas brings us one step closer to ensuring that mariners consider whale-friendly shipping practices on the same global scale. Whale Atlas is now live and can be found on the new Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies website at https://bluewhalesblueskies.org/resources/.

Career Submariner Takes Helm as Navy's New Top Officer,https://maritime-executive.com/article/career-submariner-takes-helm-as-navy-s-new-top-officer,,26/08/2025 04:13:21,,"Adm. Daryl Caudle has been sworn in as the Navy's newly-confirmed Chief of Naval Operations, taking over from Vice CNO Adm. Jim Kilby, who has been in the top post in an acting capacity since the dismissal of Adm. Lisa Franchetti in February. Caudle is a chemical engineer by training, and he commissioned into the Navy after graduating from North Carolina State; he holds a masters in physics and another in engineering management, plus a doctorate in organizational leadership. He has run Fleet Forces Command, the Navy's training and sustainment arm, since 2021; before that, he was a career submarine officer, culminating in an appointment as Commander, Submarine Forces - the Navy's top undersea domain officer. ""The sailor will be front and center in my vision throughout my tenure as CNO — hands down, no exception,"" Caudle said at his change of command ceremony. ""To ensure that they are ready to fight and win decisively — today, tomorrow and well into the future — we will view everything we do we through an operational lens focused on three priorities: the foundry, the fleet and the way we fight."" The new CNO also emphasized that the Navy must transform itself with AI, robotics, autonomous systems, hypersonics and other advanced technologies in order to maintain deterrence. ""The way we fight today will not be the way we fight tomorrow,"" Caudle said. Caudle has a reputation as a persistent solver of technical and organizational problems. He was selected at a time of pressing need: all of the Navy's new construction programs are behind schedule, and existing surface combatants, subs, amphibs and carriers face delays at repair yards, reducing availability. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan made clear that Caudle's troubleshooting skills were valued. ""Admiral Caudle, 'the honey badger,' is the right man for the job,"" Phelan said. ""He has a reputation for challenging the status quo, demanding results and refusing to accept excuses. I look forward to seeing that relentlessness pursuit of excellence and persistence pervade the halls of the Pentagon."" Caudle takes the helm at a time of rapid change for the Navy, both in personnel and in structure. Last week, Navy Reserve chief Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Navy Special Warfare commander Rear Adm. Jamie Sands were both dismissed from their posts. The Navy has not provided a reason for the dismissals; both leaders had been promoted to their positions in August 2024. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to pull responsibility for sub procurement out of the Navy's command structure and put it directly under the deputy secretary of defense, according to USNI. A new three-star ""submarine czar"" in the Pentagon will have budget control over sub maintenance, oversee the multibillion-dollar industry-boosting program for the sub supply chain, and work with the Navy to set requirements for new submarines - all functions that previously existed within Naval Sea Systems Command.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 09:32:44

Fire-Damaged Wan Hai 503 is Being Towed to the Middle East,https://maritime-executive.com/article/fire-damaged-wan-hai-503-is-being-towed-to-the-middle-east,,26/08/2025 19:30:24,,"The fire-damaged containership Wan Hai 503 is going to be towed to the Middle East as the shipping company continues to search for a port of refuge. The vessel has been at sea for 11 weeks (a total of 78 days) since the fire began while it was off the coast of India. Wan Hai released the update saying the tow is underway toward the Middle East, but the final port of refuge is still under consideration. The move toward the Middle East came after Sri Lanka rejected an application for the vessel to be berthed, while India had, shortly after the fire began, ordered its ports not to accept the vessel. The crew reported that the ship experienced an explosion and subsequent fire while sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Nhava Sheva, India on June 9. At the time it was approximately 50 nautical miles off the coast of India. “At present, the vessel’s stability, structural integrity, and draft—together with the route assessed using weather-routing software—meet the requirements for safe towing,” reports Wan Hai. The shipping company working with the appointed salvage company said the process will be closely monitored to ensure a safe and smooth arrival at the designated port of refuge. Last week, Hapag-Lloyd, which had cargo aboard the ship, gave an update putting its position approximately 177 nautical miles from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and close to the Indian EEZ boundary. India, in late June, had ordered the salvage tugs to pull the ship out of its EEZ, where the ship had remained for more than eight weeks while salvage efforts proceeded. For the past few weeks, the salvage reports have indicated that there were no visible flames or signs of fire, although one hold continued to show minor signs of smoldering. Temperatures have also been lowered aboard the ship. Salvors were able to board the ship and undertook the efforts to dewater the holds and engine room. While the danger seems minimal at this point, they have struggled to find a port of refuge. Reports said they were looking to the east, working with Singapore Maritime & Ports Authority as the flag state for the ship. The ship instead is going to be towed approximately 1,800 nautical miles crossing the Arabian Sea. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which also suffered a significant container fire off the coast of India, also ended up making the trip to Khor Fakkan in the UAE before a port of refuge could be settled. However, in that case, the ship had not been abandoned and was traveling under its own power. The UAE has large, deep-water ports that can serve as a refuge. It also has the container handling capabilities to clear the debris from the vessel. The last pictures, which came from the Indian Directorate General of Shipping in mid-July, showed that after the fire was extinguished, nearly everything on the forward two-thirds of the ship in front of the deck house and bridge had been damaged. A few containers on the stern appear to have been blocked from the fire by the deckhouse. The vessel also appeared to be on an even keel and higher in the water after the dewatering efforts.",Maritime Executive,26/08/2025 21:29:19

Third Training Ship Christened as Backdrop for US-South Korea Shipbuilding,https://maritime-executive.com/article/third-training-ship-christened-as-backdrop-for-us-south-korea-shipbuilding,,27/08/2025 03:49:27,,"The third U.S. training ship, State of Maine, was christened on Tuesday, August 26, in a ceremony designed to highlight the emerging partnership between the United States and South Korea for shipbuilding. The event was rescheduled a week so that it could coincide with the visit to the United States by South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, and a day after he met with Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. The South Korean President toured the Philadelphia shipyard that was acquired by Hanwha Ocean for approximately $100 million at the end of 2024. The company’s acquisition pre-dated the Trump initiative to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding and was seen as an entry into the U.S. naval market. The company looks to expand its work for the U.S. Navy and government ships, such as the training ships, and now to leverage the opportunities under the Trump programs. Hanwha aims to produce LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long term, naval vessels at its U.S. shipyard. Hanwha has committed to a $5 billion program dedicated to the installation of additional docks and quays to increase capacity at the shipyard. It is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility, and through the expansion, Hanwha aims to increase Philly Shipyard’s annual production volume from less than two vessels to up to 20. In addition to the infrastructure investment, the U.S. subsidiary of Hanwha’s shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, announced that it has ordered 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers from Hanwha Philly Shipyard, with the first tanker expected to be delivered by early 2029. It previously announced it will buy a Korean-built LNG carrier and complete its outfitting at the U.S. yard to make it the first modern American-flagged LNG carrier built in 50 years. Elaine Chao doing the honors for the naming (American Maritime Officers) Lee toured Hanwha Philly Shipyard, joined by officials from the Department of Transportation, the Maritime Administration, and others from the U.S. government, while attending the christening ceremony. Speaking through a translator, Lee said, ""The Republic of Korea's shipbuilding industry is setting out to take on a new challenge to contribute to strengthening U.S. maritime security and rejuvenating America's shipbuilding industry."" He highlighted the rapid growth of the country’s industry from “bare ground” to a powerhouse in just 50 years and referred to the “miracle of K-shipbuilding.” ""Through the MASGA (Make American Shipbuilding Great Again) project, we will achieve a 'win-win' outcome that would see the shipbuilding industries of both the United States and South Korea take a leap forward together,"" Lee highlighted. Yesterday, he promised Trump that South Korea would invest at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding, along with other key industries. Hanwha Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim expressed gratitude to the leaders of both countries and emphasized the importance of joint partnership in bolstering the shipbuilding industry. He said, “Today’s christening ceremony is the physical embodiment of our two nations working side by side to reindustrialize industry, expand our capacity to build ships, and invest in the skilled workforce that will drive the industry forward.” The third ship of the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) program, State of Maine, is the first purpose-built training ship for the Maine Maritime Academy. At 525 feet in length, it can accommodate 600 cadets for training and, in times of humanitarian need, can handle up to 1,000 people and provide access to an advanced medical facility. The ship, which is due to arrive in Maine later this year, features eight classrooms, an auditorium, and training labs, including a specially-designed training bridge. It has a helicopter pad and is outfitted both to handle containers and roll-on/roll-off cargo to give the cadets hands-on training. “This vessel marks a new era for American maritime power,” said Acting Maritime Administrator Sang Yi, who represented Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was detained in Washington and did not attend the ceremony. “MARAD’s mission to modernize sealift and empower the Merchant Marine hinges on relentless innovation and partnership. Together, we can build the fleet America needs to secure our future and dominate the seas.” Elaine Chao, who has held various senior roles in the U.S. government, including Secretary of Transportation in the first Trump administration, was godmother for the vessel. In prior administrations, she served on the Federal Maritime Commission and as Secretary of Labor. Philly Shipyard had delivered the first two vessels of the class to New York and Massachusetts. Hanwha Ocean is completing the project to build two additional training ships, which MARAD has assigned to the state maritime academies in Texas and California. The yard has also started work on the first of three LNG-fueled containerships for Matson and is completing a rock installation vessel for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
South Africa Restricts Bunkering to Protect Endangered Penguin,https://maritime-executive.com/article/south-africa-restricts-bunkering-to-protect-endangered-penguin,,27/08/2025 03:06:16,,"South Africa's government has implemented new restrictions on STS transfers and bunkering off its coastline, hoping to head off environmental damage from a potential spill. Its Algoa Bay area is a key bunkering hub for traffic on the Cape of Good Hope route, which has grown by leaps and bounds due to the Red Sea crisis - but conservation groups say that all the activity is putting a colony of critically-endangered penguins at risk. The regulation bans STS transfers within three nautical miles of shore, as well as areas within aquaculture zones and marine protected areas. The rule sets up restrictions on bunkering in Algoa Bay, limiting transfers to specific anchorages and imposing seasonal restrictions on activity. Operators will also have to monitor for the presence of protected penguins and marine mammals during transfers, and will have to use a hydrophone system to listen for the movements of these species. To further reduce the risk of pollution, transfers will be prohibited in wind speeds over 22 knots or wave heights over six feet, and only a limited number of vessels will be allowed in the bay at any given time. Operators will also be required to maintain spill-response vessels on standby to be ready to clean up in the event of a petroleum release. Breaches of the new rules are punishable with a penalty of up to $2.1 million and a prison sentence of up to five years. “These regulations are a decisive step to safeguard our oceans and secure the future of our African Penguin. They set strict standards for offshore ship-to-ship transfers, ensuring that maritime activity can only proceed in a safe and responsible way,"" said South African environment minister Dr. Dion George. Conservationists claim that heightened bunkering activity has cut the population of the African penguin in Algoa Bay by more than 90 percent, putting the world's most endangered penguin species further at risk. Local wildlife NGO SANCCOB said in a statement that it doubts that the new measures will be effective. A colony on Algoa Bay's St. Croix Island was once the largest remaining African penguin colony, with 8,000 breeding pairs living there in 2015, the year before bunkering started in the bay. There are currently 700 breeding pairs on the island, according to SANCCOB, which blamed noise from increased vessel traffic and a series of spills. The group called for banning bunker transfers at night, when releases are least likely to be detected and hardest to clean up, and reducing the wave height limitation to three feet. According to SANCCOB, the government loosened the final version of the rule by removing a requirement for operators to abide by IMO underwater noise reduction guidelines, a modification that favors vessel operators.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Havila Voyages Plans First Climate-Neutral Norwegian Coastal Round Trip,https://maritime-executive.com/article/havila-voyages-plans-first-climate-neutral-norwegian-coastal-round-trip,,27/08/2025 02:47:14,,"Havila Voyages, which already operates four Norwegian coastal cruise ships fueled with LNG and equipped with batteries, reports it is preparing to take the next step: a climate-neutral round trip along the Norwegian coast. The trip will cover more than 5,000 nautical miles, and the company believes it can be part of an example of Norway’s leadership in transitioning the shipping industry. “Right now, we are in the planning phase to test a full round voyage on the coastal route this fall, using biogas in combination with our large battery packs,” said Bent Martini, CEO of Havila Voyages. “We are in dialogue with suppliers to secure sufficient volumes to be able to fill the tanks 100 percent with biogas, and we believe we will succeed.” Martini revealed that Havila Voyages is exploring the possibility of the sailing on its coastal route from Bergen to Kirkenes and back to Bergen. He said they hope to accomplish it as early as this fall. “That would mean that one of our ships, already this fall, could prove that it is possible to sail over 5,000 nautical miles, the entire Coastal Route, climate neutrally.” Havila built four 15,800 gross ton cruise ships using energy-efficient hull designs created to handle the varied conditions along the Norwegian coast. The ships, which can carry up to 650 passengers, including 179 between ports and 468 in cabins, are LNG fueled and equipped with a battery pack of 6.1 megawatt-hours (MWh). The company in June 2022 demonstrated the capabilities of the 86-ton battery pack, which it says allows them to operate emission-free for up to four hours. The Havila Castor sailed using just the batteries, cruising the historic Geirangerfjord. “If Norwegian authorities are serious about their environmental ambitions, the ships on the coastal route can be a beacon for the green transition in shipping and create synergies for other parts of the industry,” says Martini. “The problem for the maritime industry, when politicians waver in their decisions as we saw in the world heritage fjords, is that no one dares to invest in the green shift.” Martini points out that stricter environmental requirements are fully achievable with today’s technology, and he hopes politicians will stand by the standards they set. “Our message to politicians and decision-makers is clear: climate neutrality should be an absolute minimum in the next contract. And we will deliver on that from day one.” Havila made history in 2018 when Norway, for the first time, split the contract for the coastal operations. It received a nine-year agreement from 2021 to 2030 alongside long-term provider Hurtigruten. Hurtigruten has also made investments in the future, adding batteries and increasing efficiency for several of its vessels. The company has revealed a design study it is pursuing to create the first of a new generation of zero-emission cruise ships. Starting on January 1, 2026, Norway begins a six-year phase-in of its zero-emission regulations for coastal shipping. It starts with smaller ships under 10,000 gross tons, and has already spurred programs for zero-emission battery and hydrogen ferries.

As soon as the Russian full-scale invasion began in 2022, the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine's seaports, repeatedly striking foreign-flag merchant ships off the coast. With American and European assistance, Ukraine countered with strikes of its own. Its forces sank the Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva with antiship missiles, and followed up with strikes on Russian warships in Crimea using British/French Storm Shadow cruise missiles. But Ukraine's real innovation was an exploding one-way drone boat, remotely controlled and cheap enough to be expendable. It was based on an American prototype that had been designed to counter a Chinese invasion fleet in the Taiwan Strait, according to the New York Times. Using this American-origin design, American Starlink connectivity, and American targeting support, Ukraine's defense intelligence agency (GUR) began regularly damaging or destroying Russian vessels in and around Crimea using swarm tactics. After several design iterations, Ukraine's drone boats have also been up-gunned to carry strike UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian air patrols. Using a mix of short range missiles, these drone boats have become the first unmanned vessels in history to shoot down helicopters and fighter aircraft. Using drones alone, the GUR's Group 13 helped Ukraine attain sea control of the western Black Sea, driving the Black Sea Fleet into the relative safety of the Novorossiysk area - without the benefit of a conventional navy. Its success made the Magura design instantly recognizable in defense circles. The U.S. Navy has been investing in its own drone prototypes, reportedly with mixed results - but to date it has not publicly included the Magura series in its test and evaluation program. The defense robotics company Red Cat, a supplier of drones to Ukraine and to the U.S. Army, has offered a way to change that. It announced in May that it would begin marketing proven drone boats with ""10,000+ hours of operating time in live combat missions"" and ""dozens of successful kinetic engagements against enemy assets,"" a description that only matches Ukraine's Magura series. Red Cat has now announced a new division to carry this product line forward in the U.S. market. The new division - Blue Ops - will offer a seven-meter ""Expeditionary Multi-Role Craft"" matching the appearance and dimensions of the Magura V7, but built in the United States. It is intended for deep strike, interdiction and anti-ship warfare - like the V7 - and has autonomous capability, increased range and payload capacity. A spokesman confirmed that it is ""based on technology already being built in various European countries and is being used in the Ukraine war."" Red Cat plans to start production in the third quarter of 2025, in partnership with an existing manufacturer of USVs. To head up the Blue Ops team, Red Cat has hired Barry Hinckley, a member of the Hinckley boatbuilding family, former tech executive, and former candidate for U.S. Senate. Hinckley has experience as a yacht broker, a startup founder and an offshore racing yachtsman. The division's co-leader will be Alexander ""Sandy"" Spaulding, the former president of Hinckley Yachts. ""The future of maritime defense depends on a fast, modular weapons system built in the U.S. That’s exactly what we’re delivering,"" said Barry Hinckley in a statement. ""We’re not replacing large naval vessels—we’re building smaller, smarter, uncrewed platforms that extend their reach, provide forward protection, and can operate in places traditional ships can’t.""",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Samsung Heavy Industries Partners with Vigor as Korea Rolls Out MASGA,https://maritime-executive.com/article/samsung-heavy-industries-partners-with-vigor-as-korea-rolls-out-masga,,27/08/2025 02:01:33,,"South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries announced a partnership with Oregon-based Vigor Marine Group as part of the companies committing to U.S. investments during the Korean president’s visit to the United States. SHI looks to use the partnership as a way to break into the lucrative repair business for the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) while also supporting South Korea’s “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) initiative. Hanwha Ocean was the first South Korean shipbuilder to win contracts under the U.S.’s maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program, and recently HD Hyundai Shipbuilding reported it has also won its first MRO contract. It comes as the U.S. looks to expand maintenance capabilities and expedite the projects by keeping the ships forward deployed as opposed to having to wait for limited shipyard space in the United States. SHI reports it will leverage its expertise and efficiency in shipbuilding while adding a new element to the forward-deployed repair program. By partnering with Vigor Marine, they report the partnership will combine VMG’s deep customer relationships, proven ability to deliver complex projects on time and on budget, and innovative, commercial mindset with SHI’s world-class Korean shipyard facilities, skilled workforce, and advanced technology leadership. Vigor Marine Group will serve as the lead U.S.-based prime contractor. “We understand the Navy’s evolving needs and have built a track record of delivering results in support of our national defense,” said Francesco Valente, President & CEO of Vigor Marine Group. “Partnering with Samsung allows us to extend that same capability to forward-deployed operations in the Indo-Pacific and potential shipbuilding opportunities here in the U.S. — helping the Navy increase its operational tempo while maintaining the highest quality standards.” Vigor reports it will continue to develop new ways to perform maintenance and modernization work more efficiently and effectively, while SHI will employ its leadership in automation, digital shipyard technology, and advanced engineering. Together, they promise to introduce new levels of innovation to forward repair operations, streamlining processes, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall fleet readiness. The deal was one of several announced during a trade meeting during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to the United States and meeting with Donald Trump. Korean companies committed to a total of $150 billion in investment in areas ranging from shipbuilding to aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and strategic minerals. Samsung Heavy Industries and Vigor Marine report they will also explore opportunities to support a U.S. shipbuilding renaissance, including a return to Vigor Marine Group’s shipbuilding roots in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor CEO Valente said investment and implementation of SHI’s advanced technology could support new shipbuilding opportunities in the United States. Vigor Marine, after being acquired by Carlyle in 2019, has consolidated its operations under a unified brand name with six locations, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to California and Alaska, as well as Virginia. The company has worked to expand its role as a preferred, full-service prime contractor in the defense and maritime sectors, offering advanced services and complete solutions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, Military Sealift Command, state ferry systems, the cruise industry, the commercial fishing industry, and more. HD Hyundai has also developed partnerships in the United States, including with Edison Chouest Offshore. As part of this week’s trade mission, it also announced an agreement with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank for investments into the U.S. shipbuilding sector. Hanwha Ocean is also planning further investments after buying the Philly Shipyard in 2024 and committing to expanding its operations.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Ukraine Protests as Russia Opens Mariupol and Berdyansk to Foreign Ships,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-protests-as-russia-opens-mariupol-and-berdyansk-to-foreign-ships,,27/08/2025 00:49:03,,"Ukrainian officials are protesting the release of a new list of ports open for foreign vessels, on which Russia is including the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. Both ports have been occupied by Russian forces since 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Mariupol was the tenth largest city in Ukraine and the second largest in the eastern region. It was a vital seaport handling metals, coal, and grain, and when the war began, multiple foreign ships were trapped in the port. The facilities are said to include 22 deep-water berths. Mariupol was the scene of heavy fighting in the first part of 2022 and a siege that ended up focusing on the seaport, an asset which Russia considers a vital prize in its occupation. The city and seaport finally fell into Russian hands in May 2022, and after many months, the foreign ships were able to escape. Russia was reported to be using it as a supply port, but commercial port operations, however, have remained mostly suspended, other than the accusations by Ukraine that Russia is stealing minerals and grains and shipping them from the port. Berdiansk was an equally important seaport, and it fell into Russia's hands in the first month of the war. It is located just 50 road miles west of Mariupol and was under Russian control by March 2022. Reports said Russia had reopened the seaport and was using it to transport military supplies. The listing of seaports released by the Russian Federation on August 22 includes both Berdiansk and Mariupol as open ports able to handle foreign ships. “We consider such actions as another attempt by Russia to legalize its occupation and consolidate illegal control over Ukrainian territories,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said in a statement issued yesterday, August 25. It “strongly condemns” the Russian actions and says it considers the order “null and void.” Ukraine is calling for Western sanctions on any company or ship that uses either port to support commercial activities. In the past, it has also taken action against ships using the occupied seaports of Crimea. The courts have permitted it to seize and auction ships that carried commercial cargoes from Crimean seaports, and it has jailed and fined crewmembers on those ships. Ukrainian media is reporting that Russia has been using both seaports to export grains grown in the east in the occupied areas of Ukraine. They contend that almost 212,000 tonnes of grain were shipped from Zaporizhia Oblast in 2023 to places including Turkey, Libya, Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Over 300,000 tonnes of grain, they report, have been moved through Berdiansk, while as much as 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes a month of minerals are being exported through the Port of Mariupol. The move comes as Russia seeks to further consolidate its gains and exert control in advance of any potential peace talks. Reports said President Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump during their meeting in Alaska that Russia would keep the occupied territories, including the Sea of Azov ports and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, as part of a peace deal. Trump has suggested there would be some “swapping” of land in the peace agreement. Top image: Port of Berdyansk (Andrew Butko / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Op-Ed: MARAD Should Follow Navy's Lead to Rebuild U.S. Maritime Strength,https://maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-marad-should-follow-navy-s-lead-to-rebuild-u-s-maritime-strength,,26/08/2025 23:21:04,,"Earlier this week, CNO Admiral Daryl Caudle and Navy Secretary John Phelan delineated their goals for the Navy - readiness, accountability, and results. They also identified clear metrics for success. The Maritime Administration and the Department of Transportation should tap the table and immediately do the same. While serving as the Maritime Administration (MARAD) Chief Counsel during the first Obama administration, I visited the rusty Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet. RRF crews repeatedly asked for additional funding, an ask I conveyed to the political appointees in the Department of Transportation (DOT). Sadly, fully funding the RRF wasn't a priority for the DOT and the Office of Management and Budget leaders of the day. The same could be said about increasing the maritime workforce, or strengthening shipbuilding. MARAD also struggled with accountability and results. This struggle stemmed from long-standing conflicting priorities between MARAD, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State and Energy. MARAD advocated for US financed goods to be shipped on US owned and crewed vessels. We fought to write the Congressionally-mandated cargo preference rule. The other agencies argued for simple money transfers. MARAD lost, and the result was the undercutting of the US maritime industry. I applaud President Trump's Executive Order on April 9, 2025 entitled ""Restoring America's Maritime Dominance."" It is now the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. It's a clear directive matched with much-needed dollars from Congress. It stops the decades long decay. Admiral Caudle told Navy sailors and civilians that he wants to be judged by specific results at the end of his tenure, to include: The Maritime Administration's equivalent is MARAD goals are intertwined with those set by the Navy. Both need a successful industrial base to build military and commercial ships. Success being ships built and repaired on time, on budget. Both need fully trained sailors. Both need fully manned ships. To put it bluntly, guns and butter have to move at the same time for the logistics tail in war to work. I am encouraged by President Trump's executive order because it demonstrates top down coverage for a robust US maritime industry, something MARAD didn't have during my term in office. We fought with DOT to write the cargo preference rule and then got undercut by USAID and State. We fought to use Jones Act vessels during the 2011 Strategic Petroleum Reserve release and then got sidelined by the Department of Energy, which wanted the oil to move on foreign-flag vessels. The Trump administration has given MARAD and DOT a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's my recommendation that they seize it, match it with Secretary Phelan's directive of readiness, accountability, and results, and adopt CNO Caudle's warfighting charge to ensure the dominance of the US maritime industry and workforce.

Inland shipping and port operations were interrupted as residents were warned of toxic gases, and at last report, 10 people were injured. The German media outlet DPA is reporting that the fire began with a car parked in a warehouse, which was storing hundreds of nitrous oxide cylinders in the south-east district of Hamburg. Firefighters attempting to reach the fire were forced back as the canisters exploded, sending debris flying. One fire truck was reportedly punctured by debris as well as a car on the nearby roadway.

Drydocks World Wins Contract to Build World's Biggest FLNG Installation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/drydocks-world-wins-contract-to-build-world-s-biggest-flng-installation,,26/08/2025 21:39:46,,"DP World's shipyard division, Drydocks World, has been awarded a contract to build the world's largest FLNG project. It will be the first time that the company has built an FLNG, among the most complex types of offshore installation, though the firm has extensive experience with LNG vessels and FSRUs. The contract was awarded by Amigo LNG, a joint venture between Texas-based energy firm Epcilon LNG and Epcilon's transition energy subsidiary, Singapore-based LNG Alliance Pte Ltd. The Amigo LNG offshore development comprises a pair of 2.1 mtpa FLNGs, plus two FSUs to store and offload the product. Combined, the offshore facility will have a capacity of 4.2 mtpa, a small but incrementally important volume. The installation site is located off the coast of Guaymas, Sonora - in the sheltered Gulf of California - but the gas to be liquefied will come from America. The site location is well situated for exports of gas from the Permian to Asian markets, without the time and cost of the Panama Canal transits needed by LNG plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. ""By partnering with Drydocks World on the world’s largest FLNG facility, we are securing best-in-class quality, exceptional production capacity, and reliable long-term performance of this critical asset. We are also harnessing the key advantages of FLNG solutions — from faster project schedules to rigorous testing and seamless pre-commissioning in a controlled fabrication yard environment,"" said Dr. Muthu Chezhian, CEO of the LNG Alliance. Amigo LNG's previously-published development plan called for building an onshore 7.8 mtpa terminal in the port of Guaymas, not an offshore plant. On Monday, LNG Alliance announced that it has signed a long term sale and purchase agreement with Macquarie covering 0.6 mtpa of the facility's production for the first 15 years of operation. Amigo LNG said that it would have its first liquefaction train for that contract up and running in the second half of 2028, the same timetable as the completion of Drydocks World's FLNG commissioning.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54
Trump Administration Plans to Withdraw Approval for Maryland Offshore Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-signals-intent-to-withdraw-approval-give-us-wind,,26/08/2025 21:15:16,,"The efforts to derail the U.S. offshore wind energy business are continuing with the Department of Justice confirming the Trump administration’s intent to withdraw previously issued approvals for Maryland’s first offshore wind farm to be developed by US Wind. Justice informed district courts in Delaware and Maryland of its intended action following an earlier jurisdictional dispute between Maryland and the federal Environmental Protection Agency that also sought to challenge the process for the Maryland project. The TV news channel in Maryland, WBOC, reported on Friday, August 22, that the Department of Justice had moved to stay a pending lawsuit in Delaware in which a homeowner is challenging the wind farm’s permits under the Clean Water Act. The reasoning the DOJ gave was its intent to withdraw approval for the wind farm, making the court case irrelevant and a waste of time. DOJ on Monday, August 25, WBOC reports, filed additional details in the District Court of Maryland. There it told the court that the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) intends to “voluntarily remand and vacate its approval of the Construction and Operations Plan” for US Wind’s Maryland windfarm project. DOJ revealed the action would come by September 12. The filing does not reveal the reasoning, but opponents of the project have long argued the approval process was rushed, lacked transparency, and “completely ignored” the concerns of residents and the city government in Ocean City, Maryland. In the past, BOEM and the Department of the Interior have said they found “concerns” when they reviewed the approval process for other wind farm projects. Last week, the Department of Commerce also cited national security concerns, saying it would launch a review of the foreign supply of material and equipment for the wind energy industry. The Biden administration approved the Maryland wind farm project in 2024 after what the company says was a multi-year and rigorous public review process. Residents and businesses in Ocean City have argued that the wind farm would hurt their tourism business. US Wind asserts that the project has a strong legal footing, and it is confident that the project’s permits were validly issued. US Wind, which is a partnership between Italy’s Renexia and American investment firm Apollo Global Management, won its lease for nearly 47,000 acres in August 2014. Final federal approvals were given in 2024, and by Maryland in June 2025. The plan calls for two phases, which, when completed, would have 114 turbines and approximately a total of 2 GW. Reports said construction could start as early as 2026, although the DOJ is citing 2028. The EPA last month sought to challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment, alleging the state was making an error in the administration of the final appeal process for permits issued to the wind farm. The state authority fired back, saying it was the EPA that was wrong, that the authority lay with the state, and that state-issued permits adhere to, or are more stringent than, federal requirements. Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who was already in a war of words with Donald Trump over the assertions about Baltimore’s police and a plan to send in the national guard, angrily responded to the news that the administration plans to challenge the wind farm. In a statement to WBOC, Moore called the administration’s plans “utterly shortsighted,” citing the investments and jobs the wind farm would provide. He said the president’s actions will directly lead to utility rate hikes for Marylanders. Moore followed the governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, who have also been speaking out after the administration last Friday, August 22, issued a stop work order for Revolution Wind, an offshore project that has been under construction since 2024. Denmark’s Ørsted said it would comply while noting the project is 80 percent installed. It is looking for clarity and considering actions, including a lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken multiple steps since its January 2025 inauguration, starting with the presidential executive order putting the sector and the leasing process under review. It has suspended future licenses, approvals, and reviews, and then started challenging approved projects. In New Jersey, it withdrew an EPA permit related to the proposed construction of a wind farm, while in New York, it suspended offshore work for a month for the Empire Wind project. In New York, it relented after political pressure, including from the Norwegian government, and reports of a deal to permit a blocked oil pipeline to proceed. The actions of the administration have created further uncertainty and pressure on an industry that was already facing challenges ranging from rising costs to supply chain problems and a lack of vessels for installation. Investors have backed away from the U.S. industry, saying the latest moves are making the risks too high to proceed with developments.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 04:39:54

Mazagon Dock and Indian Coast Guard Place Record High-Speed Order,https://maritime-executive.com/article/mazagon-dock-and-indian-coast-guard-place-record-high-speed-order,,27/08/2025 04:35:55,,"[By: Everllence] Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., based in Mumbai, India, has placed an order for 14 × 3 × 16V175D-MM high-speed engines from Everllence. The engines will power 14 Fast Patrol Vessels (FPVs) currently under construction for the Indian Coast Guard. The engines are all rated at 2,960 kW and scheduled for delivery from December 2025 to December 2027. The FPVs will be equipped with waterjet propulsion systems and are designed to reach speeds exceeding 33 knots. They will be deployed for coastal surveillance, fisheries protection, search-and-rescue operations, and can also be used for military missions in times of crisis. Ben Andres, Head of Sales at Everllence, said: “This project marks a major milestone for Everllence as we enter the Indian Coast Guard market – a highly strategic and demanding customer - and extend our long partnership with Mazagon Dock with another significant order. We are proud to be part of this collaboration, which not only strengthens our presence in the region but also highlights the trust placed in our 175D engine.” Waldemar Wiesner, Vice President, Head of Marine and PrimeServ Marine & Power, Middle-East/Africa at Everllence, said: “The 175D proved to be the right technical choice for this project. Close collaboration with Mazagon Dock’s technical and commercial teams was key to securing this important contract. We are thankful to the Indian Coast Guard for its timely scrutiny of technical documents and technical clearance.” The new order follows closely on the heels of another major, Indian order that Everllence won in April 2025, that time from the Indian Navy when Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. ordered complete propulsion packages from Everllence for five newbuild Fleet Support Ships. Each scope of supply features 2 × 20V32/44CR engines. About the 175D engine Everllence developed the 175D engine range to supplement and complete its product portfolio in the maritime sector. Available in three variants of 12-, 16- and 20-cylinders, the engine is available with an output ranging from 1,500 to 4,400 Kilowatts and is optimised for propelling ferries, offshore support ships, tugs and other working vessels. Other market areas, such as superyachts, planing yachts and naval marine applications are also served by additional engine variants. The 175D is also an extremely eco-friendly engine, having been designed from the outset for low fuel-consumption, coupled with compliance to the latest exhaust-gas emission standards and considering as well future-fuel requirements where it is already cleared for operation on biofuels such as FAME and HVO.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 09:30:11
"Owners of Ex-Bouchard ATB Fleet Tussle in Court, Sidelining Vessels",https://maritime-executive.com/article/owners-of-ex-bouchard-atb-fleet-tussle-in-court-sidelining-vessels,,27/08/2025 04:19:02,,"Pennantia, the JV company that acquired eight ATBs out of the former Bouchard fleet, has paused its operations amidst a legal fight between its majority owner and its operator. One of the vessels has been arrested in Panama on a lien filed by the operator, and another of the idled ATBs may have attracted Coast Guard attention over manning levels, according to court filings. The shipowning JV, Pennantia, is majority-owned by Contrarian Capital, with minority owner Rose Cay handling maritime operations under contract (the Rose Cay name is the fleet's operating brand). Rose Cay alleges that Pennantia - controlled by Contrarian Capital - has stopped paying in full for operating expenses, and it has suspended shipmanagement services while demanding repayment. In response, Pennantia sued Rose Cay and accused it of trying to shut down operations on a false pretext in order to scuttle the pending sale of the ATB fleet. Both parties deny each others' allegations. The fallout is a new speed bump for the remnants of the Bouchard empire. The Pennantia partnership bought eight ATBs from the former Bouchard Transportation fleet when Bouchard was dissolved and its assets split up in 2021. Pennantia's acquisition includes younger Jones Act vessels, ranging from 4,000-horsepower tugs up to the tanker-sized ex-Kim M. Bouchard / RCM 270. After purchase, the fleet was initially operated by Foss under contract, but Rose Cay took over management in 2022. At that time, it took crewing and operations under its own umbrella and subcontracted these tasks to a new subsidiary, named Dove Cay LLC. In December 2024, Rose Cay claimed that Pennantia owed about $9.5 million in unpaid expenses and interest to Dove Cay, and in February it escalated with a declaration that Pennantia was in default. (Pennantia denies these claims.) Dove Cay then filed liens against the entire Pennantia fleet totaling about $29 million, including $13 million for repayment of a loan. In response, Pennantia called Rose Cay's claims ""fabricated"" and last month it filed for a court injunction to prevent Rose Cay and Dove Cay from idling the fleet or pursuing their maritime liens. In an order signed on August 18, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Pennantia's motion for an injunction in the case, allowing Dove Cay to pursue its liens against the vessels while litigation continues. The judge also allowed Rose Cay to terminate its shipmanagement contract with Pennantia, on the understanding that minimum safety and manning requirements would continue to be met. The two parties are in mediation and have discussed possible terms for a settlement; in the meantime, AIS data shows that the firm's active tugs are all at berth or at anchor in New York, Panama and Port Arthur.

Digitalisation Presents Emerging Psychological Pressures for Seafarers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/digitalisation-presents-emerging-psychological-pressures-for-seafarers,,27/08/2025 03:20:17,,"[By: VIKAND] As the digital transformation accelerates across the maritime industry, global maritime healthcare leader VIKAND warns there is a growing need to recognise and address the psychological toll of new technologies on seafarers’ mental health. While digitalisation has enabled earlier intervention and expanded access to mental health services onboard, such as remote counselling and telehealth, VIKAND notes that the long-term impact on seafarers' well-being is still unfolding. “Early access to care is undoubtedly promising, but we're only beginning to understand the psychological cost of this digital shift,” says Martin Hedman, VIKAND's Director of Mental Wellness Practices. “Technology is a double-edged sword - it streamlines support, yet introduces stressors that we haven’t fully accounted for. “Over the past 20 years, new psychological stressors have emerged from digital life including doomscrolling fatigue, loneliness from social isolation through phone use, and anxiety from navigating the increasingly complex digital processes.” One of the most pressing concerns is the persistent stigma and privacy issues surrounding digital mental health services. Many crew members, particularly senior staff, remain cautious about engaging with these services due to concerns that their data could be misused or held against them, such as losing their jobs. These anxieties, while rarely spoken outright, are frequently raised in informal conversations. Generational differences also play a role. “Older crew members often struggle more with digital interfaces, such as using smartphones for training or health access,” says Martin. “What is intuitive to a younger seafarer may be a barrier to another, amplifying stress and isolation.” Though no direct increase in mental health cases explicitly citing “technology” or “automation” has been recorded, VIKAND observes that digitalisation subtly contributes to workload pressures and fatigue, particularly in non-marine departments tasked with managing complex digital systems. Mental health professionals are integrating tech-related stress and digital fatigue into broader wellness discussions, though VIKAND says formal protocols are still emerging. Looking ahead, Martin notes that ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) could become a growing theme. With constant connectivity, seafarers are increasingly exposed to life onshore potentially heightening feelings of separation from family or online social engagement. “FOMO will be a big part of the ever so connected seafarers’ stress in the future. That is not just stress about always checking your email or social media account, but also to become even more aware of what you are missing out when you are away such as being reminded of family,” explains Martin. Additionally, automation may streamline tasks but also shift certain responsibilities onto crews, sometimes increasing the administrative load. “It’s important that we ensure these tools are implemented with care – designed to support, not overwhelm,” adds Martin. ""We need to balance the benefits of technology with a more mindful approach. He adds that with connectivity, over-accessibility may foster habits of always needing to be online, potentially leading to digital dependency. . “In today’s connected world, mental health and digital environments are closely linked,” concludes Martin. “The maritime industry could benefit from adapting further to that reality.” For more information about VIKAND’s mental wellness initiatives, visit www.vikand.com.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 09:30:11
Wallem Launches Vessel IT Security and Management Services,https://maritime-executive.com/article/wallem-launches-vessel-it-security-and-management-services,,27/08/2025 03:10:58,,"[By: Wallem Group] Wallem Group, a leading global maritime partner, has launched a suite of support and consultancy services to protect IT systems onboard its clients’ vessels from disruption. Its new Vessel IT Security and Management Services (VITS) offer comprehensive support to enable smooth, secure and efficient IT at sea in an increasingly digitalised and regulated maritime world. VITS have been developed with a ship's entire digital ecosystem in mind – from its business networks to the Internet of Things (IoT) systems on which operations and humans rely. It includes six management and security services to help keep vessel IT systems up and running, and minimise cyber threats. Wallem VITS offer continuous Servicedesk Support to customers from experts in vessel IT. When necessary, enquiries are escalated to specialist in-depth service teams. A Remote Vessel Infra Support service swiftly resolves IT issues from shore. In more complex cases, Wallem offers Onboard Vessel IT Support, deploying engineers to the ship to offer hands-on assistance with IT infrastructure, system upgrades, health checks and troubleshooting. “The VITS suite is Wallem’s comprehensive response to shipping’s advancing digitalisation, and the critical role IT reliability plays in maritime operations,” said Steve Whitby, Group IT & Technology Director, Wallem Group. “Ship owners increasingly seek efficiencies from remote IT support, remote management, and remote monitoring of vessel operations. Securing these benefits requires deep IT knowledge and long-standing maritime experience. VITS delivers these core specialised services.” Shipping’s growing reliance on IT explained why the other three service modules in VITS focus on cyber security, added Whitby. “Modern vessel operations demand connected IT infrastructure, but this can expose outdated onboard systems and virus signatures, hardware performance issues, and deficiencies in data back-up and IT support. Owners must secure networks, onboard systems, and data against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorised access. VITS offers tailored services to safeguard vessel IT.” VITS includes a Vulnerability Management service, through which the Wallem team scans shipboard computers annually to identify vulnerabilities, then applies patches and security-hardening measures remotely to ensure the vessel's IT remains secure and compliant. Its Advanced Endpoint Protection, meanwhile, is a signatureless security service that uses machine learning and behavioural analysis to defend systems against zero-day attacks and evolving threats. Critical systems are safeguarded by an Enhanced Backup Service, which is activated in the event of a cyber-attack or hardware failure. It features a network-based back-up vault with integrated virus protection, remote monitoring and restoration support. VITS also offers a Security Benchmark Service, reporting on security gaps, compliance shortfalls and best practice.

Navy Officer Takes the Helm at Central Command,https://maritime-executive.com/article/navy-officer-takes-the-helm-at-central-command,,27/08/2025 06:14:37,,"Command of United States Central Command, whose area of responsibility stretches through 21 countries from Israel in the West, across the Middle East, to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the East, changed earlier this month. General Michael Kurilla, in post since April 2022 and a combat-seasoned infantry officer, handed over to Admiral Brad Cooper. A change in command often signals a change in emphasis. Admiral Cooper hitherto has commanded the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59), the Ticonderoga Class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG 64) at ship level, and at fleet level Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Expeditionary Strike Group 7 in Okinawa, US Naval Forces Korea and the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. He has moved up from being Deputy Commander CENTCOM. He thus has intimate experience of the Middle East region acquired over many years, has recently overseen anti-Houthi operations in the Red Sea and understands in depth the character of threats posed by Iran’s regional activities. Despite priorities being accorded to the threat posed by China, conflicts in the Middle East continue to demand Department of Defense attention, notwithstanding a desire to pivot away from never-ending issues. Those selected for command at Theatre level qualify on the basis of their political acumen as well as their joint command experience, so the service background of Admiral Cooper should not be of immediate relevance in tackling these recurring Middle Eastern issues. Indeed, in similar circumstances, new commanders normally endeavor to compensate for perceived loyalty to their own parent service by focusing particularly hard on the requirements of other services. Admiral Cooper is likely to be no different. However, over time, Admiral Cooper’s substantial naval experience in the Middle East is likely to influence his approach to operational issues as they arise. Admiral Cooper has an academic interest in intelligence matters, and was instrumental in fielding Task Force 59, a fleet of unmanned surveillance drones able to improve surveillance of the Iranian coastline and other maritime bottlenecks. He is likely, once he has settled in to his new and wider responsibilities, to have particular ideas on how to improve the effectiveness of naval operations in his area of command, using this background, and now has increased influence on Congressional budgeting to fund such initiatives. However, he will have to overcome resistance and competition from Indo-Pacific Command, which will complain about the diversion of resources and heavy expenditure of missiles in recent Middle East engagements. Having an officer with this particular experience-set in charge of CENTCOM should in due course have significant impact on operations countering malign Iranian and Houthi maritime activities - but in ways which will not necessarily be advertised in advance. Given Admiral Cooper’s track record, these are likely to include an emphasis on technical innovation, alongside less reliance on long-term ground presences and a greater exploitation of the flexibility of naval power projection.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 15:41:55
Trump Doubles Tariffs on India Over Russian Oil Imports,https://maritime-executive.com/article/trump-doubles-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-imports,,27/08/2025 06:04:58,,"Following through on its pledge to penalize India for buying Russian oil, the Trump administration has raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. The decision doubles the effective tariff rate on Indian exports, applying more pressure on New Delhi to negotiate trade terms with Washington. Export manufacturers in India have already begun laying off staff in anticipation of reduced American demand for the country's big export categories, like diamonds, jewelry, clothing and farmed shrimp. The 50 percent tariff is exceptionally high compared with the 15 percent base levy for Japan, South Korea and the EU, or even the 20 percent rate negotiated by neighboring Bangladesh; it compares to the rate for India's major-power rival, China, which currently faces a 55 percent tariff. The tariff hike puts Indian exporters in a bind, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded with stimulus measures. He has promised to cut taxes to offset loss of income, and has doubled down on his message of ""Make in India"" self-reliance. ""Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties - we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches,"" Modi said at an address in Delhi. Modi has also scheduled an unusual trip to China, his first since 2018. India and China have faced off along their mountainous border region for years, and relations have been chilly since a major clash in 2020. But both face major trade challenges with Washington, and Modi - a key U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific - has decided to fly to Beijing for a security summit attended by leaders from Pakistan, Iran, Russia and other nations. Chinese President Xi Jinping will preside over the gathering this weekend. ""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" Modi said last week, emphasizing normalization. China has undergone a tariff roller-coaster even more pronounced than India's, ranging from 20 percent in February to 125 percent in May, then back down to the current level of 55 percent. On Monday, President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports up again to 200 percent if Beijing does not allow the resumption of shipments of rare-earth magnets, critically needed for U.S. defense applications. A tariff ""truce"" between the two sides is in effect until November, and China has dispatched top negotiator Li Chenggang to Washington this week to continue talks towards a permanent agreement, according to the Wall Street Journal.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 15:41:55

A large cargo ship was driven onto the shore, and at least four people have died from injuries and flooding during the powerful storm. The storm was traveling west across the Pacific, encountering the Philippines as a tropical depression and dropping large amounts of rain on portions of China. By the time it reached Vietnam, it had strengthened with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to NASA. Other parts of Vietnam were reporting sustained winds of 82 mph. Vietnam had been preparing for the storm. At least half a million people had been evacuated before Kajiki reached the coastline. The wood chip carrier Thanh Thanh Dat 99 (22,300 dwt) had been anchored at the northern port of Ninh Binh, but on the evening of August 25, during a lull ahead of the storm attempted to sail south toward Nghi Son port. The ship, which is 495 feet (151 meters) in length, was traveling only with ballast as it was due to load in Nghi Son. The captain reported that by the time they reached the anchorage, the winds and waves were too strong to drop anchor. They were attempting to hold the ship in position as the storm approached. At 11:30 p.m. local time on August 25, they notified the authorities that the vessel was drifting from a position approximately two nautical miles offshore. Two hours later, they reported that the ship was dangerously close to shore. The cargo ship came to rest approximately 70 to 100 meters (230 to 325 feet) from shore. The authorities reported the ship was stable and that the crew was uninjured. They will explore refloating the ship after the storm has passed. The country is continuing to deal with widespread flooding and damage to structures. At least 13 people were reported injured in addition to the four confirmed deaths. The storm continued west, weakening with winds of 38 mph as it reached the border with Laos.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 21:29:11
HD Hyundai to Merge Ulsan Shipyards to Expand Defense and Commercial Work,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-to-merge-ulsan-shipyards-to-expand-defense-and-commercial-work,,27/08/2025 19:52:01,,"HD Hyundai, which is already South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, announced plans to reorganize by merging its shipbuilding operations in Ulsan to realize opportunities both in naval shipbuilding and repair, and the South Korean MASGA (Make America Shipbuilding Great Again) initiative. The company said that it looks to take a leadership role in the South Korean program following the meeting earlier this week between the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, and Donald Trump, in which South Korea committed to investing at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding and other key industries. As part of the agreement, the company announced a new partnership with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank to pursue a maritime investment strategy. Under the terms of the proposed merger, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries will acquire the mid-sized operation HD Hyundai Mipo with HHI as the surviving company. HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding holding company, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, owns 74 percent of HHI and 42 percent of Mipo, and after the merger will have a 69 percent position in the combined company. HHI says the merger is an effective response to future changes in the shipbuilding industry and points to the opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs and structure by integrating its systems. Media reports are highlighting that China recently consolidated its two large shipbuilding companies and that Japan’s two largest shipbuilders have also reorganized. In the first seven months of 2025, HD KSOE reported that it booked orders for a total of 82 ships worth $11.22 billion. It has achieved 62 percent of the annual order target of $18.05 billion for 2025. HHI specializes in larger vessels, including LNG carriers and containerships, while Mipo is considered a medium-sized operation building containerships, chemical tankers, and vehicle carriers. One of the key markets the combined company will be targeting is defense shipbuilding, which HD Hyundai highlighted to investors as a rapidly growing segment as countries expand their investments. HHI reports it has built 106 naval vessels, more than any other domestic shipbuilder. It has experience with destroyers, frigates, submarines, and patrol boats, and looks to expand both internationally and specifically with the United States as part of the MASGA program. “We will increase our competitiveness in the K shipbuilding and defense sectors by reorganizing the shipbuilding business,” the company told investors. It said the target is to grow defense revenues to $7.2 billion annually by 2035. It also looks to expand its entry into the repair business. The company recently won its first MRO contract from the U.S. for the overhaul of a U.S. Military Sealift vessel, USNS Alan Shepard, a 41,000-ton displacement Lewis and Clark class dry cargo and ammunition vessel. As part of MASGA, they believe this business segment will grow rapidly. They also look to expand their expertise in specialty ships, pointing to the opportunity for icebreakers due to the rise in Arctic development. South Korea previously announced that it plans to launch an Arctic shipping initiative and recently ordered a new Arctic research vessel. The combined company will also accelerate its focus on green shipping. They will consolidate the R&D and design capabilities of the two shipbuilders. Mipo will also provide additional capacity to the combined company, as reports are that it is currently operating at a rate of 45 ships but has a capacity to reach 70 ships annually. The combined company plans to launch by December a new overseas investment holding company to be based in Singapore. It will manage the operations of the shipyards in Vietnam and the newly launching yard in the Philippines, as well a the recently acquired tank and crane manufacturer in Vietnam that it has agreed to acquire from Doosan. HD Hyundai has also been exploring additional overseas operations, including possibly a shipyard in Morocco and Egypt, and has formed new relationships in the United States.",Maritime Executive,27/08/2025 21:29:11

"Australian Police Find 900 Kilos of Meth in Container of ""Spring Rolls""",https://maritime-executive.com/article/australian-police-find-900-kilos-of-meth-in-container-of-spring-rolls,,28/08/2025 03:19:26,,"Australian authorities have seized an exceptionally large shipment of amphetamine in a shipping container at a port in New South Wales, among the largest ever found in the region. On August 20, a team of Australian Border Force officers used intelligence profiling to pick a container for extra scrutiny at Port Botany. When they x-rayed the box, which was marked ""vegetable spring roll and more,"" they found that the ""and more"" part of the cargo declaration was accurate. Instead of spring rolls, they found hundreds of boxed rolls of shrink-wrap packaging, each roll filled with a core of white granules. The substance tested positive for amphetamine. In total, the concealed drugs amounted to about 900 kilos of amphetamine, worth a total of $40 million on the street in Australia. The ABF turned the matter over to the Australian Federal Police, which determined that the shipment was linked to a serious organized crime group with transnational ties. The drug consignment was added to a legimate shipment, authorities believe, without the cargo owners' knowledge. Courtesy AFP AFP carried out search warrants at a warehouse in Western Sydney and a house on the north side of Sydney Harbour, and the investigation continues. ""We use a sophisticated intelligence and risk assessment based approach, which has proven to yield significant results,"" ABF Superintendent Jared Leighton said. ""The scale of harm that would have been caused if these drugs landed in our community is unimaginable."" It is the latest in a long string of illegal stimulant busts at ports in Australia, which (per UNDOC) is the developed world's top per-capita consumer of cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine. Organized crime groups from China and South America have a hand in these illicit supply chains, attracted by the towering profits to be found on the Australian drug market. Smugglers continue to innovate: in January, AFP officers seized a cargo of ""pink cocaine,"" a club-drug mixture with ketamine and MDMA, and last October the agency caught a group that had hidden bricks of cocaine inside of two crated marine engines.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Ship Manager Fined $2M for MARPOL Offense After Crew Provides Evidence,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ship-manager-fined-2m-for-marpol-offense-after-crew-provides-evidence,,28/08/2025 02:33:51,,"U.S. officials are reporting yet another case in which a MARPOL violation was discovered after a crewmember turned over evidence to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Department of Justice reported on August 25 that V.Ships Norway pleaded guilty to the violation and was sentenced to pay a $2 million fine. “Dumping oil-contaminated waste into the waters around our ports and coasts violates the law and poses an unnecessary health and environmental hazard,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “The crew took pains to hide their illegal activity by knowingly keeping inaccurate records. We will not turn a blind eye to this kind of irresponsible and fraudulent activity.” DOJ reports that between February 2022 and August 2022, a hose was connected between the incinerator waste oil tank and the sewage holding tank on the product tanker Swift Winchester (46,000 dwt). The vessel was at the time operating under the Marshall Islands flag and owned by Winchester Shipping and managed by V. Ships. The hose was a type of “magic pipe” that allowed oily waste to transfer into the sewage holding tank and then to be discharged directly into the sea, bypassing required pollution prevention equipment. A low-ranking engine crewmember reported this to a superintendent at V.Ships. The superintendent investigated the matter and discovered what appeared to be oil in the sewage tank. DOJ acknowledges that V.Ships dismissed the Chief Engineer. In August 2022, the new Chief Engineer ordered the engine crew to clean the Oil Water Separator (OWS) filter. The engine crew took the filter onto the deck and hosed it down with a degreaser, and the oily waste washed directly overboard through a scupper. Coast Guard members from the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur conducted an examination of the vessel. While they were in the engine room, a crewmember disclosed the discharges and provided photographic and video evidence documenting the illegal discharges. The M/T Swift Winchester was charged with entering Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 25, 2022, and Port Arthur, Texas, on September 7, 2022, with a knowingly falsified Oil Record Book. V.Ships admitted that oily bilge water and oily waste were discharged from the vessel and that the discharges were omitted from the Oil Record Book.

NATO Patrol Aircraft Chase Russian Sub as U.S. Carrier Operates off Norway,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nato-patrol-aircraft-chase-russian-sub-as-u-s-carrier-operates-off-norway,,28/08/2025 02:11:29,,"A substantial share of the NATO maritime surveillance aircraft fleet has been engaged in tracking a Russian submarine off the coast of Norway. The movements of Russia's attack subs are of interest every day, but this one has attracted extra attention because it is in the same region as the carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is currently operating alongside Norwegian allied forces in the North Sea. According to the UK's Daily Express, P-8 surveillance aircraft from the UK, the U.S. and Norway have saturated a search area near the Ford Carrier Strike Group since last week. More than two dozen sorties have been flown so far, including at least eight flown by the UK's Royal Air Force. Some of the capacity originated from an airbase in Sicily, on the other side of Europe, suggesting a high priority for diverting assets to this mission. A UK defense source told The Sun that the operation was ""highly unusual,"" and several British sources called it a show of force from NATO. “It is telling Russia: ‘We see you,'” former Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe told the outlet. The Barents Observer has reported that three Yasen-class Russian attack subs departed the pens at Severomorsk earlier this week, based on satellite imagery. USS Gerald R. Ford and her escorts departed the Mediterranean earlier this month and transited through the English Channel to reach the North Sea. On arrival, the Ford strike group met up with Norwegian units to conduct joint drills. The exercise is part of Ford's deployment to the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations, and is intended to demonstrate the ""U.S. Navy's ironclad commitment to the stability and security of the European theater."" Separately, Russian fighters intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8A over the Black Sea on Wednesday, and the pilots filmed an interaction with the U.S. Navy plane. This particular P-8 had extended its rarely-spotted AESA radar, the Advanced Airborne Sensor pod - a powerful air and surface search device. The P-8 was on a mission to patrol the waters off Novorossiysk, the Russian Navy's bastion in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea.

Japan Proposes Changes in Wind Energy Terms as Mitsubishi Withdraws,https://maritime-executive.com/article/japan-proposes-changes-in-wind-energy-terms-as-mitsubishi-withdraws,,28/08/2025 02:08:37,,"The Japanese government is looking for means to revitalize its lagging efforts to develop offshore wind energy. The move comes as Mitsubishi, which in a consortium had won the first large auction, confirmed it has decided not to proceed with three wind farms. Japan’s offshore wind energy sector has been slow to start and faces significant challenges due to the offshore topography. There are limited near-shore positions for fixed-bottom wind turbines. To achieve the government’s goals of 45 GW by 2040, the industry will have to develop floating wind technology. To date, Japan has developed only a few small near-shore wind farms with a total installed capacity of approximately 300 MW. The consortium with Mitsubishi won in December the first large-scale auctions that consisted of three offshore sites near Akita on the northwest of Honshu in the Sea of Japan and Chiba, which is approximately 25 miles from Tokyo. The two sites on the Sea of Japan called for 819 MW and 478.8 MW, while the site near Tokyo would have been 390 MW, and all were fixed-bottom projects. Work was expected to start this year and next, and collectively they called for nearly 1.7 GW. Mitsubishi announced a review of the projects in February, citing increasing costs and changed economics, while reporting it would record a $354 million charge. The company, however, initially denied media reports earlier this week that indicated that the projects were being canceled. However, in a statement issued on August 27, Mitsubishi confirmed it has decided not to proceed with the development of the projects. The company said that the business environment for offshore wind power has changed worldwide due to factors such as tight supply, inflation, exchange rates, and rising interest rates, since the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. It called the changes unexpected and said that while it continues to recognize the role of renewable energy, it would not be proceeding with the three projects. The group was involved in the manufacture of wind turbine generators since 1982, but sold its joint venture to Vestas in 2020. “To adapt to these unexpected changes, we have been pursuing various options, including reassessment of costs, project schedule, and revenue. However, after discussions among the partners, we have determined that establishing a viable business plan is not feasible given the current conditions,” the company said in its statement. Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Yoji Muto, called the decision “deeply regrettable.” He said it would undermine trust in the industry. The Ministry, along with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, had just completed an expert panel review of the industry. It submitted a proposal to the government calling for revising the terms of the leases, adding a provision so that companies could apply for an additional 10 years. The leases in the first three rounds of auctions in Japan provided a 30-year total term and required removal and rebidding at the end of the term. Experts point out that companies would have approximately 20 years of operation after the time required for permitting and construction. The panel said adding 10 years would give companies more time to improve cash flow, increase electricity sales, and provide for earlier capital recovery. They believe this will also attract a broader range of investors. They proposed changing the terms for future auctions, but did not address making the provision for the 10-year extension available for the existing leases. The ministry said it plans to restage the auctions for the leases that Mitsubishi is not proceeding with. In Europe, they have also begun to extend wind leases. Denmark in June issued the first extension for an offshore wind lease. It followed with two more agreements later that same month, also highlighting that the extended term would improve the economics of some of its oldest operating wind farms while also maintaining the flow of renewable energy.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Oceanbird Wing Sail Reaches for the Sky in Demonstration,https://maritime-executive.com/article/oceanbird-wing-sail-reaches-for-the-sky-in-demonstration,,28/08/2025 01:02:35,,"After more than three years of planning and research, Oceanbird unveiled its first prototype wing sail as the latest entry into the wind-assisted propulsion market. At an event in Sweden on August 25, the company said it is entering a new phase as it moves to commercial application, which will see the first sail installed aboard a vessel I 2026. Oceanbird, the company, was launched in 2021 as a partnership between Sweden’s Wallenius Lines and Alfa Laval with the mission of developing the concept for commercial application. Wallenius first previewed its concept of a sail-powered car carrier in 2020. A Swedish R&D project team, consisting of Wallenius Marine, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SSPA/RISE, and supported by Swedish Transport Administration, spent over three years refining the design, while the company also worked on the business concepts. “We believe that wind propulsion can grow into a significant new industry for Sweden — one that brings together engineering, sustainability, and maritime leadership,” said Magnus MackAldener, interim CEO & Head of R&D at Oceanbird, who moderated the inauguration. With the sail cutting the ribbon as it rose, MackAldener said they were ready to show it to the world and take orders. The prototype is installed at the Orsesund DryDocks in Landskrona, Sweden. It stands 40 meters (131 feet) and is 14 meters (46 feet) wide. It rose from the lowered position, unfolded its two segments, and demonstrated a full rotation. Oceanbird has installed a full control room at the yard for demonstrations and crew training. The sail has a high-strength steel core. The aerodynamic surface is a composite of glass fiber, and it is made from 370,000 recycled plastic bottles. They are calling it Wing 560. “We need pioneers who are willing to take risks, to innovate, and to lead the way into the green industrial transformation, and this is a great example of leadership. Oceanbird stands as proof of this success,” said Andreas Carlson, Sweden's Minister of Infrastructure and Housing at the inauguration. During the event, the sail was raised and unfurled and demonstrated its rotation (Oceanbird) The company highlights that it has undertaken extensive data simulations as well as physical tests. It conducted wind tunnel and model tests in open water and water tanks. It has also undertaken Lidar measurements. They report that a single wing can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 10 percent, and with the full installation, it will be possible to achieve up to a 90 percent reduction in emissions if all the factors are aligned. The next step is the assembly of a second, identical wing sail, which will be completed this fall at the yard. It will be installed on the Wallenius Wilhelmsen vessel Tirranna at the beginning of 2026. Built in 2009, the 30,000 dwt vessel with a capacity of 7,620 cars was fitted in July 2024 with the foundation for the wing sail. Preparations have been completed, and they will begin tests aboard the operational vessel. The tests come as wind-assisted propulsion continues to generate interest in the industry. Several concepts of rigid sails and wind rotors are being installed in an increasing number of commercial vessels. Operations have confirmed the expected fuel savings on vessels ranging from tankers to bulkers and RoRos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Italian Coast Guard Detains Boxship for Not Ensuring it Meets Emissions Reg,https://maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-detains-boxship-for-not-ensuring-it-meets-emissions-reg,,27/08/2025 23:21:32,,"Guardia Costeria is reporting that it has detained a smaller containership after it was unable to determine that the vessel was in compliance with emissions regulations. The Mediterranean became an Emission Control Area (ECA) this year, while the Italian authority reports that it has detained ten ships this year for failing to comply with international regulations. The new situation arose in Genoa on August 21 when the Hansa Horneburg (23,644 dwt) arrived from the Italian port of Vado Ligure. The vessel, which is registered in Liberia and managed by Leonhardt & Blumberg of Germany, was built in China in 2007. It has a capacity for 1,732 TEU, The Italian authority reports that it conducted an inspection of the vessel, and although it is equipped with valid certifications, it could not determine full compliance with the regulation relating to the containment of nitrogen oxide (NOx). The authority says that components of the electric generators did not display compliance identification, and it was unable to determine if they complied with the NOx technical code. Guardia Costiera was unable to determine compliance with the emissions regulation (Guardia Costiera) Guardia Costeria reports it undertook a comprehensive inspection from the bridge to the engine room as well as crew areas. It also conducted a safety drill aboard the vessel. The Italians said that since compliance could not be ensured, the vessel was being detained. This year and last, the vessel underwent inspections in the United States and Peru without incident. The increased diligence comes as the Mediterranean ECA became official on May 1, 2025, the fifth ECA zone under the IMO’s regulations. The IMO highlighted that ships operating in the new ECA would be subject to strict mandatory measures to prevent, reduce, and control air pollution. The focus is on sulfur emissions and particulate matter. Ships operating in the Mediterranean must comply with stricter content limits than those set by the global standard (0.10 percent mass by mass (m/m) for sulfur, compared with 0.50 percent m/m allowed outside SOx ECAs). AIS signals show that the Hansa Horneburg remains in Genoa as of August 27. The Italian authority says it will be detained until the deficiencies are addressed under the supervision of the flag administration and the class society. It will also be required to pass a follow-up Port State Control Inspection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Hanwha Shipping Details Largest U.S. Commercial Vessel Order in 20 Years,https://maritime-executive.com/article/hanwha-shipping-details-largest-u-s-commercial-vessel-order-in-20-years,,27/08/2025 21:55:11,,"Hanwha Shipping, the newly-launched U.S. shipping subsidiary of South Korea’s Hanwha Ocean, provided additional details on its shipbuilding plans, which it is calling the largest U.S. commercial vessel order in more than 20 years. The company looks to build out the U.S. Jones Act tanker fleet and launch the first modern U.S. LNG carriers for the international export market. “We are able to order these U.S.-made MR tankers because of Hanwha’s investment in building a world-class shipyard in Philadelphia,” said Ryan Lynch, President & CEO of Houston-based Hanwha Shipping. “Hanwha has made a long-term commitment to bringing cutting-edge technology from Korea to the Hanwha Philly Shipyard that will create thousands of good, advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States and spearhead the revitalization of America’s maritime industrial base.” The hallmark of the initiative is an order for 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers to be built in Philadelphia. The first tanker is expected to be delivered by early 2029, in what Hanwha Shipping terms “the highest-value commercial order seen at U.S. shipyards.” The MR vessels will be fitted to transport crude oil, refined petroleum, and chemical products, and will significantly expand the U.S. Jones Act fleet of U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed vessels operating between U.S. ports. Delivered in 2017, American Pride was the 28th ship built by the yard since it started commercial operations in 2000 (Philly Shipyard) The ships return the yard now known as Hanwha Philly Shipyard to its roots. Started in 2000 at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, the company, known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, started with contracts to build 46,000 to 50,000 dwt tankers. This included a dozen 600-foot MT46 Veteran-class tankers for Overseas Shipping Group and concluded in 2017 when it delivered American Pride, the fourth 50,000 dwt product tanker built for American Petroleum Tankers (APT), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. The yard delivered 24 tankers in addition to its six containership builds for Matson. As the only company in the world with significant shipbuilding operations in both Korea and the U.S., Hanwha reports it plans to build new MR tankers in the U.S. by transferring its advanced shipbuilding technologies, processes, and supply chains to Hanwha Philly Shipyard. At the same time, Hanwha Shipping also exercised an option to order a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, following its first order announced a month ago. They will be the first U.S.-ordered LNG carriers for the export market in almost 50 years and respond to the Trump plan that calls for requiring a portion of U.S. LNG exports to be transported on U.S. ships. The ships will be built via a joint construction model between Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of the U.S.-Korea partnership. The orders are an element of a $5 billion infrastructure plan announced yesterday for Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of South Korea’s commitment to supporting the growth of U.S. shipbuilding. After acquiring the shipyard at the end of 2024, the company plans to install two additional docks and three quays to increase annual capacity from less than two vessels to up to 20. Hanwha is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility as it targets work for LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long-term, naval vessels built at the U.S. shipyard. The Hanwha group quietly launched Hanwha Shipping, based in Texas, in April 2024. According to the company, it aims to take a leading position in the American shipping ecosystem by deploying next-generation digital technologies and advancing the resilience and robustness of America’s energy security and maritime industrial base.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36
Saildrone Secures Class Certification for its Largest Unmanned Vessel,https://maritime-executive.com/article/saildrone-secures-class-certificate-for-its-largest-unmanned-vessel,,27/08/2025 21:04:07,,"Saildrone, the California-based manufacturer of long-endurance ISR and survey drone boats, now operates the world's largest fully-classed unmanned surface vessel. In partnership with ABS, the company has obtained classification for its 20-meter Saildrone Surveyor after a rigorous review process. Among other benefits, the achievement allows the unmanned boats to operate in the waters of nations that require vessels to maintain a class certificate. ""The ABS class certification is . . . a signal to governments and the maritime industry that Saildrone USVs are mature, safe, tested, and ready for scale,"" said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone's founder and CEO. ""It’s been a very large investment and a multi-year process to achieve ABS class certification, but we are proud to be the first company in the world to do so."" ABS said in a statement that it has made a concerted effort to support unmanned vessel technology development. ""ABS and Saildrone are pioneering new frontiers, setting the pace for innovation. This step forward is a result of our investments in ABS’ technical capability and helping to ensure our Rules are able to support innovation with an unwavering focus on safety,"" said Patrick Ryan, ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. The two partners have been working together on certification for years. In 2023, ABS provided interim classification for Saildrone's 10-meter Voyager design, a popular choice for research and government customers like NOAA and the U.S. Navy. Saildrones have deployed everywhere from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic to the center of an Atlantic hurricane, collecting data for months at a time without human intervention - a key challenge for unmanned surface vessels. The company markets its vessels on a charter basis, and claims that its service model radically reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional vessels. Surveyor takes payload capabilities up a notch compared to previous models, and can support more technically demanding missions like subsea survey, acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) water column analysis and geotechnical data collection. It has been used commercially to map subsea cables for Meta, but it is built around the needs of the U.S. Navy: the large drone is built to ABS Light Warship standards, and is equipped with the kind of capability that the Navy needs to support persistent MDA and undersea warfare data collection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 04:39:36

"After Sanctions and Ukrainian Attacks, Russian Oil Flows Shift",https://maritime-executive.com/article/after-sanctions-and-ukrainian-attacks-russian-oil-flows-shift,,28/08/2025 04:49:16,,"Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure are having complex effects on the nation's oil exports. Attacks on Russian refineries have sharply cut down domestic processing, freeing up more crude for export. At the same time, strikes on the Druzhba pipeline have hit cross-border exports to Russia's remaining customers in Hungary and Slovakia, temporarily cutting off export flows to Central Europe - and further raising the volume that needs to go to market by sea. Ukraine's refinery attacks have been picking up speed this month, and in recent weeks it has hit about 10 Russian oil refineries, temporarily taking out about 17 percent of all Russian refining capacity (about 1.1 million barrels per day). Fuel shortages, price hikes and regional schemes for fuel rationing have been reported within Russia, and the Kremlin has banned gasoline exports in an attempt to keep refined fuel supplies higher at home. The attacks are likely enabled by two new long-range weapons, the Batyar drone and the ""Flamingo"" cruise missile. Drones very much like the Batyar were photographed during Sunday's attack on the Novatek gas processing plant at Ust-Luga, a key Russian energy port near St. Petersburg. Ukraine's SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the strike, calling it an example of ""drone sanctions"" on Russian energy. Amidst the disruption, Russia's seaborne crude shipments fell to about 320,000 barrels per day in mid-August, according to Bloomberg - even though Reuters reports that Russia is trying to increase seaborne crude oil exports by 200,000 bpd, likely in search of a market for volumes that would normally be refined domestically or sold via the Druzhba pipeline. Reduced loadings at Ust-Luga accounted for most of the drop, and it is possible that Ukraine's strikes on the Druzhba pumping stations also affected deliveries to the loading port (via the northern branch of the pipeline). A second development could be discouraging seaborne export loadings at Russia's Baltic terminals. India, the second-biggest buyer of Russian crude, is buying about 500,000 barrels per day less than it was in June - likely because of EU sanctions on a key Indian refiner, as well as the punishing 25% extra tariff that the Trump administration has imposed on India over its Russian oil imports. However, China - the leading importer of Russian oil - has increased buying of these discounted barrels at the same time that India's imports have fallen. According to Kpler, Chinese refiners have picked up 15 extra cargoes of oil for October and November delivery, all from the western Russian ports that ordinarily ship to India.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16
"USACE Awards Contract to Build Strategic Harbor at Nome, Alaska",https://maritime-executive.com/article/usace-awards-contract-to-build-strategic-harbor-at-nome-alaska,,28/08/2025 04:34:52,,"After a slow start, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has awarded a contract to begin construction on a revamp of the harbor at Nome, Alaska, the first stage of a plan to turn it into a deepwater home port for the U.S. Coast Guard. At 64.5 degrees north, Nome is just shy of the Arctic Circle and just 100 nautical miles southeast of the Bering Strait. It has strategic relevance in a region with an increasing Russian and Chinese presence. But its utility is limited by its infrastructure: Currently, the port's outer basin depth limits traffic to vessels with a draft of no more than 18 feet - far too shallow for most commercial and military vessels. In 2011, the USACE launched a multiyear study on improvements to the port, and it recommended deepening the harbor to 28 feet. That study was paused in 2015 after the cancellation of Shell's Arctic drilling program, which removed the economic justification for creating a deepwater port on the Bering Sea. The process was rebooted in 2016, and four years later, the port published a plan to deepen the harbor's maximum depth to 40 feet and enlarge it with new causeways and piers. The estimated project cost came to about $660 million; once federal funding was in hand, the Corps went about soliciting bids for construction. All of the bids came in too high, the Corps said in 2024, and the agency decided to cancel its contract solicitation. This month, the Corps announced that it has awarded a $399 million contract to a sole bidder to pay for the first phase of the project only. This phase - funded by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - covers the construction of one 1,200-foot causeway, and will add one new berth face. The main dredging operation is scheduled next in Phase 2, which will be bid out separately. “A robust and efficient transportation hub at Nome is foundational to the long-term viability of surrounding communities in the region,” said Col. Jeffrey Palazzini, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers – Alaska District in a statement. “We are committed to assisting the City of Nome by providing a reliable solution that improves the port’s navigation efficiency.” Once completed, a 40-foot harbor basin would have the depth needed to accommodate the U.S. Coast Guard's interim icebreaker, USCGC Storis (ex name Aiviq), as well as its anticipated Polar Security Cutter heavy icebreaker. For years, the service's small icebreaking fleet has been homeported in Seattle, where there is access to a full-size shipyard and a marine industrial supply chain. But Seattle is 1,800 nautical miles away from the Bering Strait, and forces based there cannot react quickly to developments in the Arctic.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Corvus Energy Battery System Powers Latin America’s First Electric Tugboat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/corvus-energy-battery-system-powers-latin-america-s-first-electric-tugboat,,28/08/2025 03:48:31,,"[By: Corvus Energy] The first electric tugboat in Latin America, the result of a collaboration between the largest towage services operator in the Americas, SAAM, and Chilean national oil company, Enap, is powered by a lithium-ion marine battery system from Corvus Energy. Based on an exclusive design from naval architects Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and built by SANMAR Shipyards for SAAM, the battery-electric tug supports ship berthing and deberthing maneuvers in one of the southernmost terminals in the world—Puerto Chacabuco in the Aysén Region of Chile in South America. About the electric tugboat The battery-powered vessel, named “Trapananda” in honor of the Chilean Patagonia region where the tug operates, measures 25 meters in length, 13 meters in beam and boasts 70 tons of bollard pull capacity, enabling it to assist large vessels under challenging harbor conditions. Third electric tug in the SAAM fleet SAAM, including its division SAAM Towage, operates more than 200 tugboats around the Americas. Notably, the Trapananda is the third battery-electric tug to join the SAAM fleet. In May 2024, SAAM launched two electric tugboats in the Port of Vancouver in Canada, making SAAM among the first zero-emission tug operators in North America. All three tugs are RAL-designed, SANMAR Shipyards-built and equipped with a Corvus Energy battery system. Environmental and operational benefits According to SAAM, battery-powered tugboats are an important part of the Company’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which includes a goal to neutralize 65% of greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of their fleet through reduction and offsetting initiatives. (Source). Fully battery-powered operations produce zero emissions and are almost completely silent. This results in significant environmental benefits, including reduced carbon footprint and less noise pollution, both in port and underwater, protecting coastal communities and marine life alike. Compared to diesel-powered tugs, electric tugboats also offer operational advantages including reduced fuel and maintenance costs. After its first year operating electric tugs in Canada, SAAM reported its “carbon intensity index [had] fallen 72% compared to diesel-powered units with similar features, and a further 90% reduction is projected for the second year of operation. In addition, the electric tugs’ operating costs were reported to be 70% lower than its diesel-powered peers.” (Source). Corvus Energy involvement The Trapananda is equipped with a Corvus Orca ESS, the most installed marine energy storage system, used onboard over 700 maritime vessels worldwide. Like the SAAM electric-powered tugs operating in Vancouver, the Trapananda is outfitted with a 3,616-kWh capacity battery system. “We are proud to support SAAM, RAL and SANMAR by supplying the battery system for the first electric tugboat to operate in Latin America, as well as for the Vancouver-based tugs,” said Tor-Gunnar Hovig, Head of Region Americas at Corvus Energy. He adds, “SAAM is leading the way towards more sustainable port operations in the Americas and beyond with these RAL-designed, SANMAR-built tugs.” ""The arrival of the Trapananda is a turning point for our industry. It signals our decisive move toward cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operations. This project represents our vision for the future: we're developing solutions that not only assist and tow ships but also help mobilize a shift toward a truly sustainable logistics chain. We consider Corvus a strategic partner in this journey,” said Pablo Cáceres, Sustainability and Development Director of SAAM Towage.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Accordingly, 4 × 7S60ME-LGIA (Liquid Gas Injection Ammonia) dual-fuel engines will be delivered to an undisclosed Asian shipyard in connection with the construction of 4 × 9,100 CEU (Car Equivalent Unit) ‘Aurora’-class Pure Car/Truck Carriers (PCTCs). Everllence views the order as signalling a new era for clean propulsion within global shipping. The newbuildings are bound for Höegh Autoliners, the major PCTC operator and part of the Leif Höegh & Co. shipping company. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. will build the engines in South Korea. Sebjørn Dahl, Chief Operations Officer, Höegh Autoliners, said: ""The engines are the beating heart of our vessels, and we take it as a clear mark of confidence that Everllence has chosen us to install some of the world’s first two-stroke ammonia engines on our final four Aurora Class vessels. With nearly 100 years of industry experience, Höegh Autoliners is proud to be among the first companies selected to pioneer this important transition together with Everllence. This collaboration underscores their trust in us as a reliable frontrunner in the shift to zero-emission shipping. Reaching zero is a shared ambition, and Everllence plays a vital role in helping us realize our goal of operating our large PCTC vessels on zero-carbon fuels from 2027."" Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business – Everllence, said: “This order – one of several ammonia pilot-projects we have in China, Japan and South Korea – gives us encouragement that we are on the right path, as does the widespread industry interest in our progress. We have adopted a responsible, safety-first approach to developing this engine on account of ammonia’s particular risk-profile, and are confident that ammonia will ultimately become one of three major, alternative fuels in the market along with methanol and methane.” Christian Ludwig – Head of Two-Stroke Sales and Promotion – Everllence, said: “We have now been running our two-stroke ammonia test engine since 2023 and can confirm that the ME-LGIA’s combustion is right where we want it. Using the Diesel principle, the ME-LGIA engine concept has many of the same merits as our existing dual-fuel engines that already entered operation over a decade ago. Inspired by these engines, we are – among other innovations – using the same sealing-oil design for the fuel-booster injection valves as this has proven to be particularly important and efficient. By end-2026, we tentatively expect to have a small number of demonstration projects on the water to enable a commercial market introduction of the G50-, S60-, G60-, G70- and G80-bore ME-LGIA engines based on positive service experience.” Aurora class Höegh’s Aurora Class will be the largest and most environmentally friendly PCTC ever built, further accelerating Höegh Autoliners’ decarbonisation efforts and setting a new standard for more sustainable deep-sea transportation. Being the first in the PCTC segment to receive DNV’s ammonia-ready and methanol-ready notations, the Auroras will also be the first to be ready to operate zero-carbon ammonia propulsion with the main engine designed by Everllence.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:31:16

Corvus Energy Battery System Powers Latin America’s First Electric Tugboat,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/corvus-energy-battery-system-powers-latin-america-s-first-electric-tugboat,,28/08/2025 03:48:31,,"[By: Corvus Energy] The first electric tugboat in Latin America, the result of a collaboration between the largest towage services operator in the Americas, SAAM, and Chilean national oil company, Enap, is powered by a lithium-ion marine battery system from Corvus Energy. Based on an exclusive design from naval architects Robert Allan Ltd (RAL) and built by SANMAR Shipyards for SAAM, the battery-electric tug supports ship berthing and deberthing maneuvers in one of the southernmost terminals in the world—Puerto Chacabuco in the Aysén Region of Chile in South America. About the electric tugboat The battery-powered vessel, named “Trapananda” in honor of the Chilean Patagonia region where the tug operates, measures 25 meters in length, 13 meters in beam and boasts 70 tons of bollard pull capacity, enabling it to assist large vessels under challenging harbor conditions. Third electric tug in the SAAM fleet SAAM, including its division SAAM Towage, operates more than 200 tugboats around the Americas. Notably, the Trapananda is the third battery-electric tug to join the SAAM fleet. In May 2024, SAAM launched two electric tugboats in the Port of Vancouver in Canada, making SAAM among the first zero-emission tug operators in North America. All three tugs are RAL-designed, SANMAR Shipyards-built and equipped with a Corvus Energy battery system. Environmental and operational benefits According to SAAM, battery-powered tugboats are an important part of the Company’s 2030 Sustainability Strategy, which includes a goal to neutralize 65% of greenhouse gas emissions from the operation of their fleet through reduction and offsetting initiatives. (Source). Fully battery-powered operations produce zero emissions and are almost completely silent. This results in significant environmental benefits, including reduced carbon footprint and less noise pollution, both in port and underwater, protecting coastal communities and marine life alike. Compared to diesel-powered tugs, electric tugboats also offer operational advantages including reduced fuel and maintenance costs. After its first year operating electric tugs in Canada, SAAM reported its “carbon intensity index [had] fallen 72% compared to diesel-powered units with similar features, and a further 90% reduction is projected for the second year of operation. In addition, the electric tugs’ operating costs were reported to be 70% lower than its diesel-powered peers.” (Source). Corvus Energy involvement The Trapananda is equipped with a Corvus Orca ESS, the most installed marine energy storage system, used onboard over 700 maritime vessels worldwide. Like the SAAM electric-powered tugs operating in Vancouver, the Trapananda is outfitted with a 3,616-kWh capacity battery system. “We are proud to support SAAM, RAL and SANMAR by supplying the battery system for the first electric tugboat to operate in Latin America, as well as for the Vancouver-based tugs,” said Tor-Gunnar Hovig, Head of Region Americas at Corvus Energy. He adds, “SAAM is leading the way towards more sustainable port operations in the Americas and beyond with these RAL-designed, SANMAR-built tugs.” ""The arrival of the Trapananda is a turning point for our industry. It signals our decisive move toward cleaner, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operations. This project represents our vision for the future: we're developing solutions that not only assist and tow ships but also help mobilize a shift toward a truly sustainable logistics chain. We consider Corvus a strategic partner in this journey,” said Pablo Cáceres, Sustainability and Development Director of SAAM Towage.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

"Australian Police Find 900 Kilos of Meth in Container of ""Spring Rolls""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australian-police-find-900-kilos-of-meth-in-container-of-spring-rolls,,28/08/2025 03:19:26,,"Australian authorities have seized an exceptionally large shipment of amphetamine in a shipping container at a port in New South Wales, among the largest ever found in the region. On August 20, a team of Australian Border Force officers used intelligence profiling to pick a container for extra scrutiny at Port Botany. When they x-rayed the box, which was marked ""vegetable spring roll and more,"" they found that the ""and more"" part of the cargo declaration was accurate. Instead of spring rolls, they found hundreds of boxed rolls of shrink-wrap packaging, each roll filled with a core of white granules. The substance tested positive for amphetamine. In total, the concealed drugs amounted to about 900 kilos of amphetamine, worth a total of $40 million on the street in Australia. The ABF turned the matter over to the Australian Federal Police, which determined that the shipment was linked to a serious organized crime group with transnational ties. The drug consignment was added to a legimate shipment, authorities believe, without the cargo owners' knowledge. Courtesy AFP AFP carried out search warrants at a warehouse in Western Sydney and a house on the north side of Sydney Harbour, and the investigation continues. ""We use a sophisticated intelligence and risk assessment based approach, which has proven to yield significant results,"" ABF Superintendent Jared Leighton said. ""The scale of harm that would have been caused if these drugs landed in our community is unimaginable."" It is the latest in a long string of illegal stimulant busts at ports in Australia, which (per UNDOC) is the developed world's top per-capita consumer of cocaine, MDMA and methamphetamine. Organized crime groups from China and South America have a hand in these illicit supply chains, attracted by the towering profits to be found on the Australian drug market. Smugglers continue to innovate: in January, AFP officers seized a cargo of ""pink cocaine,"" a club-drug mixture with ketamine and MDMA, and last October the agency caught a group that had hidden bricks of cocaine inside of two crated marine engines.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Höegh Autoliners Orders 1st Ammonia Engines for Pure Car & Truck Carriers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hoeegh-autoliners-orders-1st-ammonia-engines-for-pure-car-truck-carriers,,28/08/2025 02:55:45,,"[By: Everllence] In a major leap for maritime decarbonisation, Höegh Autoliners has placed a landmark order for ammonia-burning Everllence B&W ME-LGIA engines. Accordingly, 4 × 7S60ME-LGIA (Liquid Gas Injection Ammonia) dual-fuel engines will be delivered to an undisclosed Asian shipyard in connection with the construction of 4 × 9,100 CEU (Car Equivalent Unit) ‘Aurora’-class Pure Car/Truck Carriers (PCTCs). Everllence views the order as signalling a new era for clean propulsion within global shipping. The newbuildings are bound for Höegh Autoliners, the major PCTC operator and part of the Leif Höegh & Co. shipping company. HD Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. will build the engines in South Korea. Sebjørn Dahl, Chief Operations Officer, Höegh Autoliners, said: ""The engines are the beating heart of our vessels, and we take it as a clear mark of confidence that Everllence has chosen us to install some of the world’s first two-stroke ammonia engines on our final four Aurora Class vessels. With nearly 100 years of industry experience, Höegh Autoliners is proud to be among the first companies selected to pioneer this important transition together with Everllence. This collaboration underscores their trust in us as a reliable frontrunner in the shift to zero-emission shipping. Reaching zero is a shared ambition, and Everllence plays a vital role in helping us realize our goal of operating our large PCTC vessels on zero-carbon fuels from 2027."" Bjarne Foldager – Head of Two-Stroke Business – Everllence, said: “This order – one of several ammonia pilot-projects we have in China, Japan and South Korea – gives us encouragement that we are on the right path, as does the widespread industry interest in our progress. We have adopted a responsible, safety-first approach to developing this engine on account of ammonia’s particular risk-profile, and are confident that ammonia will ultimately become one of three major, alternative fuels in the market along with methanol and methane.” Christian Ludwig – Head of Two-Stroke Sales and Promotion – Everllence, said: “We have now been running our two-stroke ammonia test engine since 2023 and can confirm that the ME-LGIA’s combustion is right where we want it. Using the Diesel principle, the ME-LGIA engine concept has many of the same merits as our existing dual-fuel engines that already entered operation over a decade ago. Inspired by these engines, we are – among other innovations – using the same sealing-oil design for the fuel-booster injection valves as this has proven to be particularly important and efficient. By end-2026, we tentatively expect to have a small number of demonstration projects on the water to enable a commercial market introduction of the G50-, S60-, G60-, G70- and G80-bore ME-LGIA engines based on positive service experience.” Aurora class Höegh’s Aurora Class will be the largest and most environmentally friendly PCTC ever built, further accelerating Höegh Autoliners’ decarbonisation efforts and setting a new standard for more sustainable deep-sea transportation. Being the first in the PCTC segment to receive DNV’s ammonia-ready and methanol-ready notations, the Auroras will also be the first to be ready to operate zero-carbon ammonia propulsion with the main engine designed by Everllence.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ship Manager Fined $2M for MARPOL Offense After Crew Provides Evidence,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ship-manager-fined-2m-for-marpol-offense-after-crew-provides-evidence,,28/08/2025 02:33:51,,"U.S. officials are reporting yet another case in which a MARPOL violation was discovered after a crewmember turned over evidence to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Department of Justice reported on August 25 that V.Ships Norway pleaded guilty to the violation and was sentenced to pay a $2 million fine. “Dumping oil-contaminated waste into the waters around our ports and coasts violates the law and poses an unnecessary health and environmental hazard,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD). “The crew took pains to hide their illegal activity by knowingly keeping inaccurate records. We will not turn a blind eye to this kind of irresponsible and fraudulent activity.” DOJ reports that between February 2022 and August 2022, a hose was connected between the incinerator waste oil tank and the sewage holding tank on the product tanker Swift Winchester (46,000 dwt). The vessel was at the time operating under the Marshall Islands flag and owned by Winchester Shipping and managed by V. Ships. The hose was a type of “magic pipe” that allowed oily waste to transfer into the sewage holding tank and then to be discharged directly into the sea, bypassing required pollution prevention equipment. A low-ranking engine crewmember reported this to a superintendent at V.Ships. The superintendent investigated the matter and discovered what appeared to be oil in the sewage tank. DOJ acknowledges that V.Ships dismissed the Chief Engineer. In August 2022, the new Chief Engineer ordered the engine crew to clean the Oil Water Separator (OWS) filter. The engine crew took the filter onto the deck and hosed it down with a degreaser, and the oily waste washed directly overboard through a scupper. Coast Guard members from the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit Port Arthur conducted an examination of the vessel. While they were in the engine room, a crewmember disclosed the discharges and provided photographic and video evidence documenting the illegal discharges. The M/T Swift Winchester was charged with entering Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on August 25, 2022, and Port Arthur, Texas, on September 7, 2022, with a knowingly falsified Oil Record Book. V.Ships admitted that oily bilge water and oily waste were discharged from the vessel and that the discharges were omitted from the Oil Record Book.

NATO Patrol Aircraft Chase Russian Sub as U.S. Carrier Operates off Norway,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nato-patrol-aircraft-chase-russian-sub-as-u-s-carrier-operates-off-norway,,28/08/2025 02:11:29,,"A substantial share of the NATO maritime surveillance aircraft fleet has been engaged in tracking a Russian submarine off the coast of Norway. The movements of Russia's attack subs are of interest every day, but this one has attracted extra attention because it is in the same region as the carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is currently operating alongside Norwegian allied forces in the North Sea. According to the UK's Daily Express, P-8 surveillance aircraft from the UK, the U.S. and Norway have saturated a search area near the Ford Carrier Strike Group since last week. More than two dozen sorties have been flown so far, including at least eight flown by the UK's Royal Air Force. Some of the capacity originated from an airbase in Sicily, on the other side of Europe, suggesting a high priority for diverting assets to this mission. A UK defense source told The Sun that the operation was ""highly unusual,"" and several British sources called it a show of force from NATO. “It is telling Russia: ‘We see you,'” former Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe told the outlet. The Barents Observer has reported that three Yasen-class Russian attack subs departed the pens at Severomorsk earlier this week, based on satellite imagery. USS Gerald R. Ford and her escorts departed the Mediterranean earlier this month and transited through the English Channel to reach the North Sea. On arrival, the Ford strike group met up with Norwegian units to conduct joint drills. The exercise is part of Ford's deployment to the U.S. 6th Fleet area of operations, and is intended to demonstrate the ""U.S. Navy's ironclad commitment to the stability and security of the European theater."" Separately, Russian fighters intercepted a U.S. Navy P-8A over the Black Sea on Wednesday, and the pilots filmed an interaction with the U.S. Navy plane. This particular P-8 had extended its rarely-spotted AESA radar, the Advanced Airborne Sensor pod - a powerful air and surface search device. The P-8 was on a mission to patrol the waters off Novorossiysk, the Russian Navy's bastion in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea.

Japan Proposes Changes in Wind Energy Terms as Mitsubishi Withdraws,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/japan-proposes-changes-in-wind-energy-terms-as-mitsubishi-withdraws,,28/08/2025 02:08:37,,"The Japanese government is looking for means to revitalize its lagging efforts to develop offshore wind energy. The move comes as Mitsubishi, which in a consortium had won the first large auction, confirmed it has decided not to proceed with three wind farms. Japan’s offshore wind energy sector has been slow to start and faces significant challenges due to the offshore topography. There are limited near-shore positions for fixed-bottom wind turbines. To achieve the government’s goals of 45 GW by 2040, the industry will have to develop floating wind technology. To date, Japan has developed only a few small near-shore wind farms with a total installed capacity of approximately 300 MW. The consortium with Mitsubishi won in December the first large-scale auctions that consisted of three offshore sites near Akita on the northwest of Honshu in the Sea of Japan and Chiba, which is approximately 25 miles from Tokyo. The two sites on the Sea of Japan called for 819 MW and 478.8 MW, while the site near Tokyo would have been 390 MW, and all were fixed-bottom projects. Work was expected to start this year and next, and collectively they called for nearly 1.7 GW. Mitsubishi announced a review of the projects in February, citing increasing costs and changed economics, while reporting it would record a $354 million charge. The company, however, initially denied media reports earlier this week that indicated that the projects were being canceled. However, in a statement issued on August 27, Mitsubishi confirmed it has decided not to proceed with the development of the projects. The company said that the business environment for offshore wind power has changed worldwide due to factors such as tight supply, inflation, exchange rates, and rising interest rates, since the pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. It called the changes unexpected and said that while it continues to recognize the role of renewable energy, it would not be proceeding with the three projects. The group was involved in the manufacture of wind turbine generators since 1982, but sold its joint venture to Vestas in 2020. “To adapt to these unexpected changes, we have been pursuing various options, including reassessment of costs, project schedule, and revenue. However, after discussions among the partners, we have determined that establishing a viable business plan is not feasible given the current conditions,” the company said in its statement. Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade, and Industry, Yoji Muto, called the decision “deeply regrettable.” He said it would undermine trust in the industry. The Ministry, along with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, had just completed an expert panel review of the industry. It submitted a proposal to the government calling for revising the terms of the leases, adding a provision so that companies could apply for an additional 10 years. The leases in the first three rounds of auctions in Japan provided a 30-year total term and required removal and rebidding at the end of the term. Experts point out that companies would have approximately 20 years of operation after the time required for permitting and construction. The panel said adding 10 years would give companies more time to improve cash flow, increase electricity sales, and provide for earlier capital recovery. They believe this will also attract a broader range of investors. They proposed changing the terms for future auctions, but did not address making the provision for the 10-year extension available for the existing leases. The ministry said it plans to restage the auctions for the leases that Mitsubishi is not proceeding with. In Europe, they have also begun to extend wind leases. Denmark in June issued the first extension for an offshore wind lease. It followed with two more agreements later that same month, also highlighting that the extended term would improve the economics of some of its oldest operating wind farms while also maintaining the flow of renewable energy.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Oceanbird Wing Sail Reaches for the Sky in Demonstration,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/oceanbird-wing-sail-reaches-for-the-sky-in-demonstration,,28/08/2025 01:02:35,,"After more than three years of planning and research, Oceanbird unveiled its first prototype wing sail as the latest entry into the wind-assisted propulsion market. At an event in Sweden on August 25, the company said it is entering a new phase as it moves to commercial application, which will see the first sail installed aboard a vessel I 2026. Oceanbird, the company, was launched in 2021 as a partnership between Sweden’s Wallenius Lines and Alfa Laval with the mission of developing the concept for commercial application. Wallenius first previewed its concept of a sail-powered car carrier in 2020. A Swedish R&D project team, consisting of Wallenius Marine, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and SSPA/RISE, and supported by Swedish Transport Administration, spent over three years refining the design, while the company also worked on the business concepts. “We believe that wind propulsion can grow into a significant new industry for Sweden — one that brings together engineering, sustainability, and maritime leadership,” said Magnus MackAldener, interim CEO & Head of R&D at Oceanbird, who moderated the inauguration. With the sail cutting the ribbon as it rose, MackAldener said they were ready to show it to the world and take orders. The prototype is installed at the Orsesund DryDocks in Landskrona, Sweden. It stands 40 meters (131 feet) and is 14 meters (46 feet) wide. It rose from the lowered position, unfolded its two segments, and demonstrated a full rotation. Oceanbird has installed a full control room at the yard for demonstrations and crew training. The sail has a high-strength steel core. The aerodynamic surface is a composite of glass fiber, and it is made from 370,000 recycled plastic bottles. They are calling it Wing 560. “We need pioneers who are willing to take risks, to innovate, and to lead the way into the green industrial transformation, and this is a great example of leadership. Oceanbird stands as proof of this success,” said Andreas Carlson, Sweden's Minister of Infrastructure and Housing at the inauguration. During the event, the sail was raised and unfurled and demonstrated its rotation (Oceanbird) The company highlights that it has undertaken extensive data simulations as well as physical tests. It conducted wind tunnel and model tests in open water and water tanks. It has also undertaken Lidar measurements. They report that a single wing can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 10 percent, and with the full installation, it will be possible to achieve up to a 90 percent reduction in emissions if all the factors are aligned. The next step is the assembly of a second, identical wing sail, which will be completed this fall at the yard. It will be installed on the Wallenius Wilhelmsen vessel Tirranna at the beginning of 2026. Built in 2009, the 30,000 dwt vessel with a capacity of 7,620 cars was fitted in July 2024 with the foundation for the wing sail. Preparations have been completed, and they will begin tests aboard the operational vessel. The tests come as wind-assisted propulsion continues to generate interest in the industry. Several concepts of rigid sails and wind rotors are being installed in an increasing number of commercial vessels. Operations have confirmed the expected fuel savings on vessels ranging from tankers to bulkers and RoRos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

The Mediterranean became an Emission Control Area (ECA) this year, while the Italian authority reports that it has detained ten ships this year for failing to comply with international regulations. The new situation arose in Genoa on August 21 when the Hansa Horneburg (23,644 dwt) arrived from the Italian port of Vado Ligure. The vessel, which is registered in Liberia and managed by Leonhardt & Blumberg of Germany, was built in China in 2007. It has a capacity for 1,732 TEU, The Italian authority reports that it conducted an inspection of the vessel, and although it is equipped with valid certifications, it could not determine full compliance with the regulation relating to the containment of nitrogen oxide (NOx). The authority says that components of the electric generators did not display compliance identification, and it was unable to determine if they complied with the NOx technical code. Guardia Costiera was unable to determine compliance with the emissions regulation (Guardia Costiera) Guardia Costeria reports it undertook a comprehensive inspection from the bridge to the engine room as well as crew areas. It also conducted a safety drill aboard the vessel. The Italians said that since compliance could not be ensured, the vessel was being detained. This year and last, the vessel underwent inspections in the United States and Peru without incident. The increased diligence comes as the Mediterranean ECA became official on May 1, 2025, the fifth ECA zone under the IMO’s regulations. The IMO highlighted that ships operating in the new ECA would be subject to strict mandatory measures to prevent, reduce, and control air pollution. The focus is on sulfur emissions and particulate matter. Ships operating in the Mediterranean must comply with stricter content limits than those set by the global standard (0.10 percent mass by mass (m/m) for sulfur, compared with 0.50 percent m/m allowed outside SOx ECAs). AIS signals show that the Hansa Horneburg remains in Genoa as of August 27. The Italian authority says it will be detained until the deficiencies are addressed under the supervision of the flag administration and the class society. It will also be required to pass a follow-up Port State Control Inspection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

The company looks to build out the U.S. Jones Act tanker fleet and launch the first modern U.S. LNG carriers for the international export market. “We are able to order these U.S.-made MR tankers because of Hanwha’s investment in building a world-class shipyard in Philadelphia,” said Ryan Lynch, President & CEO of Houston-based Hanwha Shipping. “Hanwha has made a long-term commitment to bringing cutting-edge technology from Korea to the Hanwha Philly Shipyard that will create thousands of good, advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States and spearhead the revitalization of America’s maritime industrial base.” The hallmark of the initiative is an order for 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers to be built in Philadelphia. The first tanker is expected to be delivered by early 2029, in what Hanwha Shipping terms “the highest-value commercial order seen at U.S. shipyards.” The MR vessels will be fitted to transport crude oil, refined petroleum, and chemical products, and will significantly expand the U.S. Jones Act fleet of U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed vessels operating between U.S. ports. Delivered in 2017, American Pride was the 28th ship built by the yard since it started commercial operations in 2000 (Philly Shipyard) The ships return the yard now known as Hanwha Philly Shipyard to its roots. Started in 2000 at the site of the former Philadelphia Navy Yard, the company, known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, started with contracts to build 46,000 to 50,000 dwt tankers. This included a dozen 600-foot MT46 Veteran-class tankers for Overseas Shipping Group and concluded in 2017 when it delivered American Pride, the fourth 50,000 dwt product tanker built for American Petroleum Tankers (APT), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan. The yard delivered 24 tankers in addition to its six containership builds for Matson. As the only company in the world with significant shipbuilding operations in both Korea and the U.S., Hanwha reports it plans to build new MR tankers in the U.S. by transferring its advanced shipbuilding technologies, processes, and supply chains to Hanwha Philly Shipyard. At the same time, Hanwha Shipping also exercised an option to order a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, following its first order announced a month ago. They will be the first U.S.-ordered LNG carriers for the export market in almost 50 years and respond to the Trump plan that calls for requiring a portion of U.S. LNG exports to be transported on U.S. ships. The ships will be built via a joint construction model between Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of the U.S.-Korea partnership. The orders are an element of a $5 billion infrastructure plan announced yesterday for Hanwha Philly Shipyard as part of South Korea’s commitment to supporting the growth of U.S. shipbuilding. After acquiring the shipyard at the end of 2024, the company plans to install two additional docks and three quays to increase annual capacity from less than two vessels to up to 20. Hanwha is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility as it targets work for LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long-term, naval vessels built at the U.S. shipyard. The Hanwha group quietly launched Hanwha Shipping, based in Texas, in April 2024. According to the company, it aims to take a leading position in the American shipping ecosystem by deploying next-generation digital technologies and advancing the resilience and robustness of America’s energy security and maritime industrial base.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Saildrone Secures Class Certification for its Largest Unmanned Vessel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/saildrone-secures-class-certificate-for-its-largest-unmanned-vessel,,27/08/2025 21:04:07,,"Saildrone, the California-based manufacturer of long-endurance ISR and survey drone boats, now operates the world's largest fully-classed unmanned surface vessel. In partnership with ABS, the company has obtained classification for its 20-meter Saildrone Surveyor after a rigorous review process. Among other benefits, the achievement allows the unmanned boats to operate in the waters of nations that require vessels to maintain a class certificate. ""The ABS class certification is . . . a signal to governments and the maritime industry that Saildrone USVs are mature, safe, tested, and ready for scale,"" said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone's founder and CEO. ""It’s been a very large investment and a multi-year process to achieve ABS class certification, but we are proud to be the first company in the world to do so."" ABS said in a statement that it has made a concerted effort to support unmanned vessel technology development. ""ABS and Saildrone are pioneering new frontiers, setting the pace for innovation. This step forward is a result of our investments in ABS’ technical capability and helping to ensure our Rules are able to support innovation with an unwavering focus on safety,"" said Patrick Ryan, ABS Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. The two partners have been working together on certification for years. In 2023, ABS provided interim classification for Saildrone's 10-meter Voyager design, a popular choice for research and government customers like NOAA and the U.S. Navy. Saildrones have deployed everywhere from the Persian Gulf to the Arctic to the center of an Atlantic hurricane, collecting data for months at a time without human intervention - a key challenge for unmanned surface vessels. The company markets its vessels on a charter basis, and claims that its service model radically reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional vessels. Surveyor takes payload capabilities up a notch compared to previous models, and can support more technically demanding missions like subsea survey, acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) water column analysis and geotechnical data collection. It has been used commercially to map subsea cables for Meta, but it is built around the needs of the U.S. Navy: the large drone is built to ABS Light Warship standards, and is equipped with the kind of capability that the Navy needs to support persistent MDA and undersea warfare data collection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Typhoon Drives Cargo Ship Ashore and Causes Widespread Damage in Vietnam,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/typhoon-drives-cargo-ship-ashore-and-causes-widespread-damage-in-vietnam,,27/08/2025 20:29:44,,"Vietnamese officials are reporting widespread damage as the 14th named storm of the 2025 season, Typhoon Kajiki, slammed ashore Monday night into Tuesday morning, August 25-26. A large cargo ship was driven onto the shore, and at least four people have died from injuries and flooding during the powerful storm. The storm was traveling west across the Pacific, encountering the Philippines as a tropical depression and dropping large amounts of rain on portions of China. By the time it reached Vietnam, it had strengthened with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, according to NASA. Other parts of Vietnam were reporting sustained winds of 82 mph. Vietnam had been preparing for the storm. At least half a million people had been evacuated before Kajiki reached the coastline. The wood chip carrier Thanh Thanh Dat 99 (22,300 dwt) had been anchored at the northern port of Ninh Binh, but on the evening of August 25, during a lull ahead of the storm attempted to sail south toward Nghi Son port. The ship, which is 495 feet (151 meters) in length, was traveling only with ballast as it was due to load in Nghi Son. The captain reported that by the time they reached the anchorage, the winds and waves were too strong to drop anchor. They were attempting to hold the ship in position as the storm approached. At 11:30 p.m. local time on August 25, they notified the authorities that the vessel was drifting from a position approximately two nautical miles offshore. Two hours later, they reported that the ship was dangerously close to shore. The cargo ship came to rest approximately 70 to 100 meters (230 to 325 feet) from shore. The authorities reported the ship was stable and that the crew was uninjured. They will explore refloating the ship after the storm has passed. The country is continuing to deal with widespread flooding and damage to structures. At least 13 people were reported injured in addition to the four confirmed deaths. The storm continued west, weakening with winds of 38 mph as it reached the border with Laos.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
HD Hyundai to Merge Ulsan Shipyards to Expand Defense and Commercial Work,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/hd-hyundai-to-merge-ulsan-shipyards-to-expand-defense-and-commercial-work,,27/08/2025 19:52:01,,"HD Hyundai, which is already South Korea’s largest shipbuilder, announced plans to reorganize by merging its shipbuilding operations in Ulsan to realize opportunities both in naval shipbuilding and repair, and the South Korean MASGA (Make America Shipbuilding Great Again) initiative. The company said that it looks to take a leadership role in the South Korean program following the meeting earlier this week between the country’s president, Lee Jae Myung, and Donald Trump, in which South Korea committed to investing at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding and other key industries. As part of the agreement, the company announced a new partnership with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank to pursue a maritime investment strategy. Under the terms of the proposed merger, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries will acquire the mid-sized operation HD Hyundai Mipo with HHI as the surviving company. HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding holding company, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, owns 74 percent of HHI and 42 percent of Mipo, and after the merger will have a 69 percent position in the combined company. HHI says the merger is an effective response to future changes in the shipbuilding industry and points to the opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs and structure by integrating its systems. Media reports are highlighting that China recently consolidated its two large shipbuilding companies and that Japan’s two largest shipbuilders have also reorganized. In the first seven months of 2025, HD KSOE reported that it booked orders for a total of 82 ships worth $11.22 billion. It has achieved 62 percent of the annual order target of $18.05 billion for 2025. HHI specializes in larger vessels, including LNG carriers and containerships, while Mipo is considered a medium-sized operation building containerships, chemical tankers, and vehicle carriers. One of the key markets the combined company will be targeting is defense shipbuilding, which HD Hyundai highlighted to investors as a rapidly growing segment as countries expand their investments. HHI reports it has built 106 naval vessels, more than any other domestic shipbuilder. It has experience with destroyers, frigates, submarines, and patrol boats, and looks to expand both internationally and specifically with the United States as part of the MASGA program. “We will increase our competitiveness in the K shipbuilding and defense sectors by reorganizing the shipbuilding business,” the company told investors. It said the target is to grow defense revenues to $7.2 billion annually by 2035. It also looks to expand its entry into the repair business. The company recently won its first MRO contract from the U.S. for the overhaul of a U.S. Military Sealift vessel, USNS Alan Shepard, a 41,000-ton displacement Lewis and Clark class dry cargo and ammunition vessel. As part of MASGA, they believe this business segment will grow rapidly. They also look to expand their expertise in specialty ships, pointing to the opportunity for icebreakers due to the rise in Arctic development. South Korea previously announced that it plans to launch an Arctic shipping initiative and recently ordered a new Arctic research vessel. The combined company will also accelerate its focus on green shipping. They will consolidate the R&D and design capabilities of the two shipbuilders. Mipo will also provide additional capacity to the combined company, as reports are that it is currently operating at a rate of 45 ships but has a capacity to reach 70 ships annually. The combined company plans to launch by December a new overseas investment holding company to be based in Singapore. It will manage the operations of the shipyards in Vietnam and the newly launching yard in the Philippines, as well a the recently acquired tank and crane manufacturer in Vietnam that it has agreed to acquire from Doosan. HD Hyundai has also been exploring additional overseas operations, including possibly a shipyard in Morocco and Egypt, and has formed new relationships in the United States.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Navy Officer Takes the Helm at Central Command,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/navy-officer-takes-the-helm-at-central-command,,27/08/2025 06:14:37,,"Command of United States Central Command, whose area of responsibility stretches through 21 countries from Israel in the West, across the Middle East, to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the East, changed earlier this month. General Michael Kurilla, in post since April 2022 and a combat-seasoned infantry officer, handed over to Admiral Brad Cooper. A change in command often signals a change in emphasis. Admiral Cooper hitherto has commanded the Arleigh Burke Class destroyer USS Russell (DDG 59), the Ticonderoga Class cruiser USS Gettysburg (CG 64) at ship level, and at fleet level Naval Surface Force Atlantic, Expeditionary Strike Group 7 in Okinawa, US Naval Forces Korea and the Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain. He has moved up from being Deputy Commander CENTCOM. He thus has intimate experience of the Middle East region acquired over many years, has recently overseen anti-Houthi operations in the Red Sea and understands in depth the character of threats posed by Iran’s regional activities. Despite priorities being accorded to the threat posed by China, conflicts in the Middle East continue to demand Department of Defense attention, notwithstanding a desire to pivot away from never-ending issues. Those selected for command at Theatre level qualify on the basis of their political acumen as well as their joint command experience, so the service background of Admiral Cooper should not be of immediate relevance in tackling these recurring Middle Eastern issues. Indeed, in similar circumstances, new commanders normally endeavor to compensate for perceived loyalty to their own parent service by focusing particularly hard on the requirements of other services. Admiral Cooper is likely to be no different. However, over time, Admiral Cooper’s substantial naval experience in the Middle East is likely to influence his approach to operational issues as they arise. Admiral Cooper has an academic interest in intelligence matters, and was instrumental in fielding Task Force 59, a fleet of unmanned surveillance drones able to improve surveillance of the Iranian coastline and other maritime bottlenecks. He is likely, once he has settled in to his new and wider responsibilities, to have particular ideas on how to improve the effectiveness of naval operations in his area of command, using this background, and now has increased influence on Congressional budgeting to fund such initiatives. However, he will have to overcome resistance and competition from Indo-Pacific Command, which will complain about the diversion of resources and heavy expenditure of missiles in recent Middle East engagements. Having an officer with this particular experience-set in charge of CENTCOM should in due course have significant impact on operations countering malign Iranian and Houthi maritime activities - but in ways which will not necessarily be advertised in advance. Given Admiral Cooper’s track record, these are likely to include an emphasis on technical innovation, alongside less reliance on long-term ground presences and a greater exploitation of the flexibility of naval power projection.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Trump Doubles Tariffs on India Over Russian Oil Imports,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-doubles-tariffs-on-india-over-russian-oil-imports,,27/08/2025 06:04:58,,"Following through on its pledge to penalize India for buying Russian oil, the Trump administration has raised tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent. The decision doubles the effective tariff rate on Indian exports, applying more pressure on New Delhi to negotiate trade terms with Washington. Export manufacturers in India have already begun laying off staff in anticipation of reduced American demand for the country's big export categories, like diamonds, jewelry, clothing and farmed shrimp. The 50 percent tariff is exceptionally high compared with the 15 percent base levy for Japan, South Korea and the EU, or even the 20 percent rate negotiated by neighboring Bangladesh; it compares to the rate for India's major-power rival, China, which currently faces a 55 percent tariff. The tariff hike puts Indian exporters in a bind, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has responded with stimulus measures. He has promised to cut taxes to offset loss of income, and has doubled down on his message of ""Make in India"" self-reliance. ""Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties - we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches,"" Modi said at an address in Delhi. Modi has also scheduled an unusual trip to China, his first since 2018. India and China have faced off along their mountainous border region for years, and relations have been chilly since a major clash in 2020. But both face major trade challenges with Washington, and Modi - a key U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific - has decided to fly to Beijing for a security summit attended by leaders from Pakistan, Iran, Russia and other nations. Chinese President Xi Jinping will preside over the gathering this weekend. ""Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,"" Modi said last week, emphasizing normalization. China has undergone a tariff roller-coaster even more pronounced than India's, ranging from 20 percent in February to 125 percent in May, then back down to the current level of 55 percent. On Monday, President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese imports up again to 200 percent if Beijing does not allow the resumption of shipments of rare-earth magnets, critically needed for U.S. defense applications. A tariff ""truce"" between the two sides is in effect until November, and China has dispatched top negotiator Li Chenggang to Washington this week to continue talks towards a permanent agreement, according to the Wall Street Journal.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Mazagon Dock and Indian Coast Guard Place Record High-Speed Order,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mazagon-dock-and-indian-coast-guard-place-record-high-speed-order,,27/08/2025 04:35:55,,"[By: Everllence] Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., based in Mumbai, India, has placed an order for 14 × 3 × 16V175D-MM high-speed engines from Everllence. The engines will power 14 Fast Patrol Vessels (FPVs) currently under construction for the Indian Coast Guard. The engines are all rated at 2,960 kW and scheduled for delivery from December 2025 to December 2027. The FPVs will be equipped with waterjet propulsion systems and are designed to reach speeds exceeding 33 knots. They will be deployed for coastal surveillance, fisheries protection, search-and-rescue operations, and can also be used for military missions in times of crisis. Ben Andres, Head of Sales at Everllence, said: “This project marks a major milestone for Everllence as we enter the Indian Coast Guard market – a highly strategic and demanding customer - and extend our long partnership with Mazagon Dock with another significant order. We are proud to be part of this collaboration, which not only strengthens our presence in the region but also highlights the trust placed in our 175D engine.” Waldemar Wiesner, Vice President, Head of Marine and PrimeServ Marine & Power, Middle-East/Africa at Everllence, said: “The 175D proved to be the right technical choice for this project. Close collaboration with Mazagon Dock’s technical and commercial teams was key to securing this important contract. We are thankful to the Indian Coast Guard for its timely scrutiny of technical documents and technical clearance.” The new order follows closely on the heels of another major, Indian order that Everllence won in April 2025, that time from the Indian Navy when Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. ordered complete propulsion packages from Everllence for five newbuild Fleet Support Ships. Each scope of supply features 2 × 20V32/44CR engines. About the 175D engine Everllence developed the 175D engine range to supplement and complete its product portfolio in the maritime sector. Available in three variants of 12-, 16- and 20-cylinders, the engine is available with an output ranging from 1,500 to 4,400 Kilowatts and is optimised for propelling ferries, offshore support ships, tugs and other working vessels. Other market areas, such as superyachts, planing yachts and naval marine applications are also served by additional engine variants. The 175D is also an extremely eco-friendly engine, having been designed from the outset for low fuel-consumption, coupled with compliance to the latest exhaust-gas emission standards and considering as well future-fuel requirements where it is already cleared for operation on biofuels such as FAME and HVO.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Owners of Ex-Bouchard ATB Fleet Tussle in Court, Sidelining Vessels",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/owners-of-ex-bouchard-atb-fleet-tussle-in-court-sidelining-vessels,,27/08/2025 04:19:02,,"Pennantia, the JV company that acquired eight ATBs out of the former Bouchard fleet, has paused its operations amidst a legal fight between its majority owner and its operator. One of the vessels has been arrested in Panama on a lien filed by the operator, and another of the idled ATBs may have attracted Coast Guard attention over manning levels, according to court filings. The shipowning JV, Pennantia, is majority-owned by Contrarian Capital, with minority owner Rose Cay handling maritime operations under contract (the Rose Cay name is the fleet's operating brand). Rose Cay alleges that Pennantia - controlled by Contrarian Capital - has stopped paying in full for operating expenses, and it has suspended shipmanagement services while demanding repayment. In response, Pennantia sued Rose Cay and accused it of trying to shut down operations on a false pretext in order to scuttle the pending sale of the ATB fleet. Both parties deny each others' allegations. The fallout is a new speed bump for the remnants of the Bouchard empire. The Pennantia partnership bought eight ATBs from the former Bouchard Transportation fleet when Bouchard was dissolved and its assets split up in 2021. Pennantia's acquisition includes younger Jones Act vessels, ranging from 4,000-horsepower tugs up to the tanker-sized ex-Kim M. Bouchard / RCM 270. After purchase, the fleet was initially operated by Foss under contract, but Rose Cay took over management in 2022. At that time, it took crewing and operations under its own umbrella and subcontracted these tasks to a new subsidiary, named Dove Cay LLC. In December 2024, Rose Cay claimed that Pennantia owed about $9.5 million in unpaid expenses and interest to Dove Cay, and in February it escalated with a declaration that Pennantia was in default. (Pennantia denies these claims.) Dove Cay then filed liens against the entire Pennantia fleet totaling about $29 million, including $13 million for repayment of a loan. In response, Pennantia called Rose Cay's claims ""fabricated"" and last month it filed for a court injunction to prevent Rose Cay and Dove Cay from idling the fleet or pursuing their maritime liens. In an order signed on August 18, Judge Sidney H. Stein denied Pennantia's motion for an injunction in the case, allowing Dove Cay to pursue its liens against the vessels while litigation continues. The judge also allowed Rose Cay to terminate its shipmanagement contract with Pennantia, on the understanding that minimum safety and manning requirements would continue to be met. The two parties are in mediation and have discussed possible terms for a settlement; in the meantime, AIS data shows that the firm's active tugs are all at berth or at anchor in New York, Panama and Port Arthur.

Hanwha Ocean Announces $5 Billion Investment in Philly Shipyard,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/third-training-ship-christened-as-backdrop-for-us-south-korea-shipbuilding,,27/08/2025 03:49:27,,"The third U.S. training ship, State of Maine, was christened on Tuesday, August 26, in a ceremony designed to highlight the emerging partnership between the United States and South Korea for shipbuilding. The event was rescheduled a week so that it could coincide with the visit to the United States by South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, and follows one day after he met with Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. The South Korean President toured the Philadelphia shipyard that was acquired by Hanwha Ocean for approximately $100 million at the end of 2024. The company’s acquisition pre-dated the Trump initiative to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding and was seen as an entry into the U.S. naval market. The company looks to expand its work for the U.S. Navy and government ships, such as the training ships, and now to leverage the opportunities under the Trump programs. Hanwha aims to produce LNG carriers, naval modules and blocks, and, in the long term, naval vessels at its U.S. shipyard. Hanwha announced a $5 billion program dedicated to the installation of additional docks and quays to increase capacity at the shipyard. It is also reviewing the build-out of a new block assembly facility, and through the expansion, Hanwha aims to increase Philly Shipyard’s annual production volume from less than two vessels to up to 20. In addition to the infrastructure investment, the U.S. subsidiary of Hanwha’s shipping arm, Hanwha Shipping, announced that it has ordered 10 medium-range (MR) oil and chemical tankers from Hanwha Philly Shipyard, with the first tanker expected to be delivered by early 2029. It previously announced it will buy a Korean-built LNG carrier and complete its outfitting at the U.S. yard to make it the first modern American-flagged LNG carrier built in 50 years. Elaine Chao doing the honors for the naming (American Maritime Officers) Lee toured Hanwha Philly Shipyard, joined by officials from the Department of Transportation, the Maritime Administration, and others from the U.S. government, while attending the christening ceremony. Speaking through a translator, Lee said, ""The Republic of Korea's shipbuilding industry is setting out to take on a new challenge to contribute to strengthening U.S. maritime security and rejuvenating America's shipbuilding industry."" He highlighted the rapid growth of the country’s industry from “bare ground” to a powerhouse in just 50 years and referred to the “miracle of K-shipbuilding.” ""Through the MASGA (Make American Shipbuilding Great Again) project, we will achieve a 'win-win' outcome that would see the shipbuilding industries of both the United States and South Korea take a leap forward together,"" Lee highlighted. Yesterday, he promised Trump that South Korea would invest at least $150 billion into U.S. shipbuilding, along with other key industries. Hanwha Vice Chairman Dong Kwan Kim expressed gratitude to the leaders of both countries and emphasized the importance of joint partnership in bolstering the shipbuilding industry. He said, “Today’s christening ceremony is the physical embodiment of our two nations working side by side to reindustrialize industry, expand our capacity to build ships, and invest in the skilled workforce that will drive the industry forward.” The third ship of the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) program, State of Maine, is the first purpose-built training ship for the Maine Maritime Academy. At 525 feet in length, it can accommodate 600 cadets for training and, in times of humanitarian need, can handle up to 1,000 people and provide access to an advanced medical facility. The ship, which is due to arrive in Maine later this year, features eight classrooms, an auditorium, and training labs, including a specially-designed training bridge. It has a helicopter pad and is outfitted both to handle containers and roll-on/roll-off cargo to give the cadets hands-on training. “This vessel marks a new era for American maritime power,” said Acting Maritime Administrator Sang Yi, who represented Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was detained in Washington and did not attend the ceremony. “MARAD’s mission to modernize sealift and empower the Merchant Marine hinges on relentless innovation and partnership. Together, we can build the fleet America needs to secure our future and dominate the seas.” Elaine Chao, who has held various senior roles in the U.S. government, including Secretary of Transportation in the first Trump administration, was godmother for the vessel. In prior administrations, she served on the Federal Maritime Commission and as Secretary of Labor. Philly Shipyard had delivered the first two vessels of the class to New York and Massachusetts. Hanwha Ocean is completing the project to build two additional training ships, which MARAD has assigned to the state maritime academies in Texas and California. The yard has also started work on the first of three LNG-fueled containerships for Matson and is completing a rock installation vessel for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Digitalisation Presents Emerging Psychological Pressures for Seafarers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/digitalisation-presents-emerging-psychological-pressures-for-seafarers,,27/08/2025 03:20:17,,"[By: VIKAND] As the digital transformation accelerates across the maritime industry, global maritime healthcare leader VIKAND warns there is a growing need to recognise and address the psychological toll of new technologies on seafarers’ mental health. While digitalisation has enabled earlier intervention and expanded access to mental health services onboard, such as remote counselling and telehealth, VIKAND notes that the long-term impact on seafarers' well-being is still unfolding. “Early access to care is undoubtedly promising, but we're only beginning to understand the psychological cost of this digital shift,” says Martin Hedman, VIKAND's Director of Mental Wellness Practices. “Technology is a double-edged sword - it streamlines support, yet introduces stressors that we haven’t fully accounted for. “Over the past 20 years, new psychological stressors have emerged from digital life including doomscrolling fatigue, loneliness from social isolation through phone use, and anxiety from navigating the increasingly complex digital processes.” One of the most pressing concerns is the persistent stigma and privacy issues surrounding digital mental health services. Many crew members, particularly senior staff, remain cautious about engaging with these services due to concerns that their data could be misused or held against them, such as losing their jobs. These anxieties, while rarely spoken outright, are frequently raised in informal conversations. Generational differences also play a role. “Older crew members often struggle more with digital interfaces, such as using smartphones for training or health access,” says Martin. “What is intuitive to a younger seafarer may be a barrier to another, amplifying stress and isolation.” Though no direct increase in mental health cases explicitly citing “technology” or “automation” has been recorded, VIKAND observes that digitalisation subtly contributes to workload pressures and fatigue, particularly in non-marine departments tasked with managing complex digital systems. Mental health professionals are integrating tech-related stress and digital fatigue into broader wellness discussions, though VIKAND says formal protocols are still emerging. Looking ahead, Martin notes that ""Fear of Missing Out"" (FOMO) could become a growing theme. With constant connectivity, seafarers are increasingly exposed to life onshore potentially heightening feelings of separation from family or online social engagement. “FOMO will be a big part of the ever so connected seafarers’ stress in the future. That is not just stress about always checking your email or social media account, but also to become even more aware of what you are missing out when you are away such as being reminded of family,” explains Martin. Additionally, automation may streamline tasks but also shift certain responsibilities onto crews, sometimes increasing the administrative load. “It’s important that we ensure these tools are implemented with care – designed to support, not overwhelm,” adds Martin. ""We need to balance the benefits of technology with a more mindful approach. He adds that with connectivity, over-accessibility may foster habits of always needing to be online, potentially leading to digital dependency. . “In today’s connected world, mental health and digital environments are closely linked,” concludes Martin. “The maritime industry could benefit from adapting further to that reality.” For more information about VIKAND’s mental wellness initiatives, visit www.vikand.com.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Wallem Launches Vessel IT Security and Management Services,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/wallem-launches-vessel-it-security-and-management-services,,27/08/2025 03:10:58,,"[By: Wallem Group] Wallem Group, a leading global maritime partner, has launched a suite of support and consultancy services to protect IT systems onboard its clients’ vessels from disruption. Its new Vessel IT Security and Management Services (VITS) offer comprehensive support to enable smooth, secure and efficient IT at sea in an increasingly digitalised and regulated maritime world. VITS have been developed with a ship's entire digital ecosystem in mind – from its business networks to the Internet of Things (IoT) systems on which operations and humans rely. It includes six management and security services to help keep vessel IT systems up and running, and minimise cyber threats. Wallem VITS offer continuous Servicedesk Support to customers from experts in vessel IT. When necessary, enquiries are escalated to specialist in-depth service teams. A Remote Vessel Infra Support service swiftly resolves IT issues from shore. In more complex cases, Wallem offers Onboard Vessel IT Support, deploying engineers to the ship to offer hands-on assistance with IT infrastructure, system upgrades, health checks and troubleshooting. “The VITS suite is Wallem’s comprehensive response to shipping’s advancing digitalisation, and the critical role IT reliability plays in maritime operations,” said Steve Whitby, Group IT & Technology Director, Wallem Group. “Ship owners increasingly seek efficiencies from remote IT support, remote management, and remote monitoring of vessel operations. Securing these benefits requires deep IT knowledge and long-standing maritime experience. VITS delivers these core specialised services.” Shipping’s growing reliance on IT explained why the other three service modules in VITS focus on cyber security, added Whitby. “Modern vessel operations demand connected IT infrastructure, but this can expose outdated onboard systems and virus signatures, hardware performance issues, and deficiencies in data back-up and IT support. Owners must secure networks, onboard systems, and data against ransomware, phishing, and unauthorised access.

South Africa Restricts Bunkering to Protect Endangered Penguin,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/south-africa-restricts-bunkering-to-protect-endangered-penguin,,27/08/2025 03:06:16,,"South Africa's government has implemented new restrictions on STS transfers and bunkering off its coastline, hoping to head off environmental damage from a potential spill. Its Algoa Bay area is a key bunkering hub for traffic on the Cape of Good Hope route, which has grown by leaps and bounds due to the Red Sea crisis - but conservation groups say that all the activity is putting a colony of critically-endangered penguins at risk. The regulation bans STS transfers within three nautical miles of shore, as well as areas within aquaculture zones and marine protected areas. The rule sets up restrictions on bunkering in Algoa Bay, limiting transfers to specific anchorages and imposing seasonal restrictions on activity. Operators will also have to monitor for the presence of protected penguins and marine mammals during transfers, and will have to use a hydrophone system to listen for the movements of these species. To further reduce the risk of pollution, transfers will be prohibited in wind speeds over 22 knots or wave heights over six feet, and only a limited number of vessels will be allowed in the bay at any given time. Operators will also be required to maintain spill-response vessels on standby to be ready to clean up in the event of a petroleum release. Breaches of the new rules are punishable with a penalty of up to $2.1 million and a prison sentence of up to five years. “These regulations are a decisive step to safeguard our oceans and secure the future of our African Penguin. They set strict standards for offshore ship-to-ship transfers, ensuring that maritime activity can only proceed in a safe and responsible way,"" said South African environment minister Dr. Dion George. Conservationists claim that heightened bunkering activity has cut the population of the African penguin in Algoa Bay by more than 90 percent, putting the world's most endangered penguin species further at risk. Local wildlife NGO SANCCOB said in a statement that it doubts that the new measures will be effective. A colony on Algoa Bay's St. Croix Island was once the largest remaining African penguin colony, with 8,000 breeding pairs living there in 2015, the year before bunkering started in the bay. There are currently 700 breeding pairs on the island, according to SANCCOB, which blamed noise from increased vessel traffic and a series of spills. The group called for banning bunker transfers at night, when releases are least likely to be detected and hardest to clean up, and reducing the wave height limitation to three feet. According to SANCCOB, the government loosened the final version of the rule by removing a requirement for operators to abide by IMO underwater noise reduction guidelines, a modification that favors vessel operators.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Havila Voyages Plans First Climate-Neutral Norwegian Coastal Round Trip,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/havila-voyages-plans-first-climate-neutral-norwegian-coastal-round-trip,,27/08/2025 02:47:14,,"Havila Voyages, which already operates four Norwegian coastal cruise ships fueled with LNG and equipped with batteries, reports it is preparing to take the next step: a climate-neutral round trip along the Norwegian coast. The trip will cover more than 5,000 nautical miles, and the company believes it can be part of an example of Norway’s leadership in transitioning the shipping industry. “Right now, we are in the planning phase to test a full round voyage on the coastal route this fall, using biogas in combination with our large battery packs,” said Bent Martini, CEO of Havila Voyages. “We are in dialogue with suppliers to secure sufficient volumes to be able to fill the tanks 100 percent with biogas, and we believe we will succeed.” Martini revealed that Havila Voyages is exploring the possibility of the sailing on its coastal route from Bergen to Kirkenes and back to Bergen. He said they hope to accomplish it as early as this fall. “That would mean that one of our ships, already this fall, could prove that it is possible to sail over 5,000 nautical miles, the entire Coastal Route, climate neutrally.” Havila built four 15,800 gross ton cruise ships using energy-efficient hull designs created to handle the varied conditions along the Norwegian coast. The ships, which can carry up to 650 passengers, including 179 between ports and 468 in cabins, are LNG fueled and equipped with a battery pack of 6.1 megawatt-hours (MWh). The company in June 2022 demonstrated the capabilities of the 86-ton battery pack, which it says allows them to operate emission-free for up to four hours. The Havila Castor sailed using just the batteries, cruising the historic Geirangerfjord. “If Norwegian authorities are serious about their environmental ambitions, the ships on the coastal route can be a beacon for the green transition in shipping and create synergies for other parts of the industry,” says Martini. “The problem for the maritime industry, when politicians waver in their decisions as we saw in the world heritage fjords, is that no one dares to invest in the green shift.” Martini points out that stricter environmental requirements are fully achievable with today’s technology, and he hopes politicians will stand by the standards they set. “Our message to politicians and decision-makers is clear: climate neutrality should be an absolute minimum in the next contract. And we will deliver on that from day one.” Havila made history in 2018 when Norway, for the first time, split the contract for the coastal operations. It received a nine-year agreement from 2021 to 2030 alongside long-term provider Hurtigruten. Hurtigruten has also made investments in the future, adding batteries and increasing efficiency for several of its vessels. The company has revealed a design study it is pursuing to create the first of a new generation of zero-emission cruise ships. Starting on January 1, 2026, Norway begins a six-year phase-in of its zero-emission regulations for coastal shipping. It starts with smaller ships under 10,000 gross tons, and has already spurred programs for zero-emission battery and hydrogen ferries. By 2032, all Norwegian shipping will have to operate with zero emissions in the historic fjords and on coastal routes.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Red Cat Plans to Start Marketing Ukraine's Drone Boats to the U.S. Navy,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/red-cat-plans-to-start,,27/08/2025 02:21:00,,"An American military drone developer has set up a new division to sell Ukrainian-tested drone boat technology to the U.S. Navy, closing the loop on the cycle of innovation that has defined the Black Sea theater of the conflict. As soon as the Russian full-scale invasion began in 2022, the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine's seaports, repeatedly striking foreign-flag merchant ships off the coast. With American and European assistance, Ukraine countered with strikes of its own. Its forces sank the Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva with antiship missiles, and followed up with strikes on Russian warships in Crimea using British/French Storm Shadow cruise missiles. But Ukraine's real innovation was an exploding one-way drone boat, remotely controlled and cheap enough to be expendable. It was based on an American prototype that had been designed to counter a Chinese invasion fleet in the Taiwan Strait, according to the New York Times. Using this American-origin design, American Starlink connectivity, and American targeting support, Ukraine's defense intelligence agency (GUR) began regularly damaging or destroying Russian vessels in and around Crimea using swarm tactics. After several design iterations, Ukraine's drone boats have also been up-gunned to carry strike UAVs and anti-aircraft missiles to counter Russian air patrols. Using a mix of short range missiles, these drone boats have become the first unmanned vessels in history to shoot down helicopters and fighter aircraft. Using drones alone, the GUR's Group 13 helped Ukraine attain sea control of the western Black Sea, driving the Black Sea Fleet into the relative safety of the Novorossiysk area - without the benefit of a conventional navy. Its success made the Magura design instantly recognizable in defense circles. The U.S. Navy has been investing in its own drone prototypes, reportedly with mixed results - but to date it has not publicly included the Magura series in its test and evaluation program. The defense robotics company Red Cat, a supplier of drones to Ukraine and to the U.S. Army, has offered a way to change that. It announced in May that it would begin marketing proven drone boats with ""10,000+ hours of operating time in live combat missions"" and ""dozens of successful kinetic engagements against enemy assets,"" a description that only matches Ukraine's Magura series. Red Cat has now announced a new division to carry this product line forward in the U.S. market. The new division - Blue Ops - will offer a seven-meter ""Expeditionary Multi-Role Craft"" matching the appearance and dimensions of the Magura V7, but built in the United States. It is intended for deep strike, interdiction and anti-ship warfare - like the V7 - and has autonomous capability, increased range and payload capacity. A spokesman confirmed that it is ""based on technology already being built in various European countries and is being used in the Ukraine war."" Red Cat plans to start production in the third quarter of 2025, in partnership with an existing manufacturer of USVs. To head up the Blue Ops team, Red Cat has hired Barry Hinckley, a member of the Hinckley boatbuilding family, former tech executive, and former candidate for U.S. Senate. Hinckley has experience as a yacht broker, a startup founder and an offshore racing yachtsman. The division's co-leader will be Alexander ""Sandy"" Spaulding, the former president of Hinckley Yachts. ""The future of maritime defense depends on a fast, modular weapons system built in the U.S. That’s exactly what we’re delivering,"" said Barry Hinckley in a statement. ""We’re not replacing large naval vessels—we’re building smaller, smarter, uncrewed platforms that extend their reach, provide forward protection, and can operate in places traditional ships can’t.""",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Samsung Heavy Industries Partners with Vigor as Korea Rolls Out MASGA,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/samsung-heavy-industries-partners-with-vigor-as-korea-rolls-out-masga,,27/08/2025 02:01:33,,"South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries announced a partnership with Oregon-based Vigor Marine Group as part of the companies committing to U.S. investments during the Korean president’s visit to the United States. SHI looks to use the partnership as a way to break into the lucrative repair business for the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) while also supporting South Korea’s “Make American Shipbuilding Great Again” (MASGA) initiative. Hanwha Ocean was the first South Korean shipbuilder to win contracts under the U.S.’s maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) program, and recently HD Hyundai Shipbuilding reported it has also won its first MRO contract. It comes as the U.S. looks to expand maintenance capabilities and expedite the projects by keeping the ships forward deployed as opposed to having to wait for limited shipyard space in the United States. SHI reports it will leverage its expertise and efficiency in shipbuilding while adding a new element to the forward-deployed repair program. By partnering with Vigor Marine, they report the partnership will combine VMG’s deep customer relationships, proven ability to deliver complex projects on time and on budget, and innovative, commercial mindset with SHI’s world-class Korean shipyard facilities, skilled workforce, and advanced technology leadership. Vigor Marine Group will serve as the lead U.S.-based prime contractor. “We understand the Navy’s evolving needs and have built a track record of delivering results in support of our national defense,” said Francesco Valente, President & CEO of Vigor Marine Group. “Partnering with Samsung allows us to extend that same capability to forward-deployed operations in the Indo-Pacific and potential shipbuilding opportunities here in the U.S. — helping the Navy increase its operational tempo while maintaining the highest quality standards.” Vigor reports it will continue to develop new ways to perform maintenance and modernization work more efficiently and effectively, while SHI will employ its leadership in automation, digital shipyard technology, and advanced engineering. Together, they promise to introduce new levels of innovation to forward repair operations, streamlining processes, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall fleet readiness. The deal was one of several announced during a trade meeting during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to the United States and meeting with Donald Trump. Korean companies committed to a total of $150 billion in investment in areas ranging from shipbuilding to aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and strategic minerals. Samsung Heavy Industries and Vigor Marine report they will also explore opportunities to support a U.S. shipbuilding renaissance, including a return to Vigor Marine Group’s shipbuilding roots in the Pacific Northwest. Vigor CEO Valente said investment and implementation of SHI’s advanced technology could support new shipbuilding opportunities in the United States. Vigor Marine, after being acquired by Carlyle in 2019, has consolidated its operations under a unified brand name with six locations, ranging from the Pacific Northwest to California and Alaska, as well as Virginia. The company has worked to expand its role as a preferred, full-service prime contractor in the defense and maritime sectors, offering advanced services and complete solutions for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, Military Sealift Command, state ferry systems, the cruise industry, the commercial fishing industry, and more. HD Hyundai has also developed partnerships in the United States, including with Edison Chouest Offshore. As part of this week’s trade mission, it also announced an agreement with U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management and the Korea Development Bank for investments into the U.S. shipbuilding sector. Hanwha Ocean is also planning further investments after buying the Philly Shipyard in 2024 and committing to expanding its operations.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ukraine Protests as Russia Opens Mariupol and Berdyansk to Foreign Ships,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ukraine-protests-as-russia-opens-mariupol-and-berdyansk-to-foreign-ships,,27/08/2025 00:49:03,,"Ukrainian officials are protesting the release of a new list of ports open for foreign vessels, on which Russia is including the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk. Both ports have been occupied by Russian forces since 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Mariupol was the tenth largest city in Ukraine and the second largest in the eastern region. It was a vital seaport handling metals, coal, and grain, and when the war began, multiple foreign ships were trapped in the port. The facilities are said to include 22 deep-water berths. Mariupol was the scene of heavy fighting in the first part of 2022 and a siege that ended up focusing on the seaport, an asset which Russia considers a vital prize in its occupation. The city and seaport finally fell into Russian hands in May 2022, and after many months, the foreign ships were able to escape. Russia was reported to be using it as a supply port, but commercial port operations, however, have remained mostly suspended, other than the accusations by Ukraine that Russia is stealing minerals and grains and shipping them from the port. Berdiansk was an equally important seaport, and it fell into Russia's hands in the first month of the war. It is located just 50 road miles west of Mariupol and was under Russian control by March 2022. Reports said Russia had reopened the seaport and was using it to transport military supplies. The listing of seaports released by the Russian Federation on August 22 includes both Berdiansk and Mariupol as open ports able to handle foreign ships. “We consider such actions as another attempt by Russia to legalize its occupation and consolidate illegal control over Ukrainian territories,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine said in a statement issued yesterday, August 25. It “strongly condemns” the Russian actions and says it considers the order “null and void.” Ukraine is calling for Western sanctions on any company or ship that uses either port to support commercial activities. In the past, it has also taken action against ships using the occupied seaports of Crimea. The courts have permitted it to seize and auction ships that carried commercial cargoes from Crimean seaports, and it has jailed and fined crewmembers on those ships. Ukrainian media is reporting that Russia has been using both seaports to export grains grown in the east in the occupied areas of Ukraine. They contend that almost 212,000 tonnes of grain were shipped from Zaporizhia Oblast in 2023 to places including Turkey, Libya, Syria, and the Houthis in Yemen. Over 300,000 tonnes of grain, they report, have been moved through Berdiansk, while as much as 40,000 to 60,000 tonnes a month of minerals are being exported through the Port of Mariupol. The move comes as Russia seeks to further consolidate its gains and exert control in advance of any potential peace talks. Reports said President Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump during their meeting in Alaska that Russia would keep the occupied territories, including the Sea of Azov ports and the regions of Zaporizhzhia, as part of a peace deal. Trump has suggested there would be some “swapping” of land in the peace agreement. Top image: Port of Berdyansk (Andrew Butko / CC BY SA 3.0)",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Op-Ed: MARAD Should Follow Navy's Lead to Rebuild U.S. Maritime Strength,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-marad-should-follow-navy-s-lead-to-rebuild-u-s-maritime-strength,,26/08/2025 23:21:04,,"Earlier this week, CNO Admiral Daryl Caudle and Navy Secretary John Phelan delineated their goals for the Navy - readiness, accountability, and results. They also identified clear metrics for success. The Maritime Administration and the Department of Transportation should tap the table and immediately do the same. While serving as the Maritime Administration (MARAD) Chief Counsel during the first Obama administration, I visited the rusty Ready Reserve Force (RRF) fleet. RRF crews repeatedly asked for additional funding, an ask I conveyed to the political appointees in the Department of Transportation (DOT). Sadly, fully funding the RRF wasn't a priority for the DOT and the Office of Management and Budget leaders of the day. The same could be said about increasing the maritime workforce, or strengthening shipbuilding. MARAD also struggled with accountability and results. This struggle stemmed from long-standing conflicting priorities between MARAD, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Departments of State and Energy. MARAD advocated for US financed goods to be shipped on US owned and crewed vessels. We fought to write the Congressionally-mandated cargo preference rule. The other agencies argued for simple money transfers. MARAD lost, and the result was the undercutting of the US maritime industry. I applaud President Trump's Executive Order on April 9, 2025 entitled ""Restoring America's Maritime Dominance."" It is now the policy of the United States to revitalize and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security and economic prosperity. It's a clear directive matched with much-needed dollars from Congress. It stops the decades long decay. Admiral Caudle told Navy sailors and civilians that he wants to be judged by specific results at the end of his tenure, to include: The Maritime Administration's equivalent is MARAD goals are intertwined with those set by the Navy. Both need a successful industrial base to build military and commercial ships. Success being ships built and repaired on time, on budget. Both need fully trained sailors. Both need fully manned ships. To put it bluntly, guns and butter have to move at the same time for the logistics tail in war to work. I am encouraged by President Trump's executive order because it demonstrates top down coverage for a robust US maritime industry, something MARAD didn't have during my term in office. We fought with DOT to write the cargo preference rule and then got undercut by USAID and State. We fought to use Jones Act vessels during the 2011 Strategic Petroleum Reserve release and then got sidelined by the Department of Energy, which wanted the oil to move on foreign-flag vessels. The Trump administration has given MARAD and DOT a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It's my recommendation that they seize it, match it with Secretary Phelan's directive of readiness, accountability, and results, and adopt CNO Caudle's warfighting charge to ensure the dominance of the US maritime industry and workforce.

Drydocks World Wins Contract to Build World's Biggest FLNG Installation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/drydocks-world-wins-contract-to-build-world-s-biggest-flng-installation,,26/08/2025 21:39:46,,"DP World's shipyard division, Drydocks World, has been awarded a contract to build the world's largest FLNG project. It will be the first time that the company has built an FLNG, among the most complex types of offshore installation, though the firm has extensive experience with LNG vessels and FSRUs. The contract was awarded by Amigo LNG, a joint venture between Texas-based energy firm Epcilon LNG and Epcilon's transition energy subsidiary, Singapore-based LNG Alliance Pte Ltd. The Amigo LNG offshore development comprises a pair of 2.1 mtpa FLNGs, plus two FSUs to store and offload the product. Combined, the offshore facility will have a capacity of 4.2 mtpa, a small but incrementally important volume. The installation site is located off the coast of Guaymas, Sonora - in the sheltered Gulf of California - but the gas to be liquefied will come from America. The site location is well situated for exports of gas from the Permian to Asian markets, without the time and cost of the Panama Canal transits needed by LNG plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast. ""By partnering with Drydocks World on the world’s largest FLNG facility, we are securing best-in-class quality, exceptional production capacity, and reliable long-term performance of this critical asset. We are also harnessing the key advantages of FLNG solutions — from faster project schedules to rigorous testing and seamless pre-commissioning in a controlled fabrication yard environment,"" said Dr. Muthu Chezhian, CEO of the LNG Alliance.

On Monday, LNG Alliance announced that it has signed a long term sale and purchase agreement with Macquarie covering 0.6 mtpa of the facility's production for the first 15 years of operation. Amigo LNG said that it would have its first liquefaction train for that contract up and running in the second half of 2028, the same timetable as the completion of Drydocks World's FLNG commissioning.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Trump Administration Plans to Withdraw Approval for Maryland Offshore Wind,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-administration-signals-intent-to-withdraw-approval-give-us-wind,,26/08/2025 21:15:16,,"The efforts to derail the U.S. offshore wind energy business are continuing with the Department of Justice confirming the Trump administration’s intent to withdraw previously issued approvals for Maryland’s first offshore wind farm to be developed by US Wind. Justice informed district courts in Delaware and Maryland of its intended action following an earlier jurisdictional dispute between Maryland and the federal Environmental Protection Agency that also sought to challenge the process for the Maryland project. The TV news channel in Maryland, WBOC, reported on Friday, August 22, that the Department of Justice had moved to stay a pending lawsuit in Delaware in which a homeowner is challenging the wind farm’s permits under the Clean Water Act. The reasoning the DOJ gave was its intent to withdraw approval for the wind farm, making the court case irrelevant and a waste of time. DOJ on Monday, August 25, WBOC reports, filed additional details in the District Court of Maryland. There it told the court that the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOEM) intends to “voluntarily remand and vacate its approval of the Construction and Operations Plan” for US Wind’s Maryland windfarm project. DOJ revealed the action would come by September 12. The filing does not reveal the reasoning, but opponents of the project have long argued the approval process was rushed, lacked transparency, and “completely ignored” the concerns of residents and the city government in Ocean City, Maryland. In the past, BOEM and the Department of the Interior have said they found “concerns” when they reviewed the approval process for other wind farm projects. Last week, the Department of Commerce also cited national security concerns, saying it would launch a review of the foreign supply of material and equipment for the wind energy industry. The Biden administration approved the Maryland wind farm project in 2024 after what the company says was a multi-year and rigorous public review process. Residents and businesses in Ocean City have argued that the wind farm would hurt their tourism business. US Wind asserts that the project has a strong legal footing, and it is confident that the project’s permits were validly issued. US Wind, which is a partnership between Italy’s Renexia and American investment firm Apollo Global Management, won its lease for nearly 47,000 acres in August 2014. Final federal approvals were given in 2024, and by Maryland in June 2025. The plan calls for two phases, which, when completed, would have 114 turbines and approximately a total of 2 GW. Reports said construction could start as early as 2026, although the DOJ is citing 2028. The EPA last month sought to challenge the Maryland Department of the Environment, alleging the state was making an error in the administration of the final appeal process for permits issued to the wind farm. The state authority fired back, saying it was the EPA that was wrong, that the authority lay with the state, and that state-issued permits adhere to, or are more stringent than, federal requirements. Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who was already in a war of words with Donald Trump over the assertions about Baltimore’s police and a plan to send in the national guard, angrily responded to the news that the administration plans to challenge the wind farm. In a statement to WBOC, Moore called the administration’s plans “utterly shortsighted,” citing the investments and jobs the wind farm would provide. He said the president’s actions will directly lead to utility rate hikes for Marylanders. Moore followed the governors of Connecticut and Rhode Island, who have also been speaking out after the administration last Friday, August 22, issued a stop work order for Revolution Wind, an offshore project that has been under construction since 2024. Denmark’s Ørsted said it would comply while noting the project is 80 percent installed. It is looking for clarity and considering actions, including a lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken multiple steps since its January 2025 inauguration, starting with the presidential executive order putting the sector and the leasing process under review. It has suspended future licenses, approvals, and reviews, and then started challenging approved projects. In New Jersey, it withdrew an EPA permit related to the proposed construction of a wind farm, while in New York, it suspended offshore work for a month for the Empire Wind project. In New York, it relented after political pressure, including from the Norwegian government, and reports of a deal to permit a blocked oil pipeline to proceed. The actions of the administration have created further uncertainty and pressure on an industry that was already facing challenges ranging from rising costs to supply chain problems and a lack of vessels for installation. Investors have backed away from the U.S. industry, saying the latest moves are making the risks too high to proceed with developments.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50

Wan Hai released the update saying the tow is underway toward the Middle East, but the final port of refuge is still under consideration. The move toward the Middle East came after Sri Lanka rejected an application for the vessel to be berthed, while India had, shortly after the fire began, ordered its ports not to accept the vessel. The crew reported that the ship experienced an explosion and subsequent fire while sailing from Colombo, Sri Lanka to Nhava Sheva, India on June 9. At the time it was approximately 50 nautical miles off the coast of India. “At present, the vessel’s stability, structural integrity, and draft—together with the route assessed using weather-routing software—meet the requirements for safe towing,” reports Wan Hai. The shipping company working with the appointed salvage company said the process will be closely monitored to ensure a safe and smooth arrival at the designated port of refuge. Last week, Hapag-Lloyd, which had cargo aboard the ship, gave an update putting its position approximately 177 nautical miles from Colombo, Sri Lanka, and close to the Indian EEZ boundary. India, in late June, had ordered the salvage tugs to pull the ship out of its EEZ, where the ship had remained for more than eight weeks while salvage efforts proceeded. For the past few weeks, the salvage reports have indicated that there were no visible flames or signs of fire, although one hold continued to show minor signs of smoldering. Temperatures have also been lowered aboard the ship. Salvors were able to board the ship and undertook the efforts to dewater the holds and engine room. While the danger seems minimal at this point, they have struggled to find a port of refuge. Reports said they were looking to the east, working with Singapore Maritime & Ports Authority as the flag state for the ship. The ship instead is going to be towed approximately 1,800 nautical miles crossing the Arabian Sea. Last year, the Maersk Frankfurt, which also suffered a significant container fire off the coast of India, also ended up making the trip to Khor Fakkan in the UAE before a port of refuge could be settled. However, in that case, the ship had not been abandoned and was traveling under its own power. The UAE has large, deep-water ports that can serve as a refuge. It also has the container handling capabilities to clear the debris from the vessel. The last pictures, which came from the Indian Directorate General of Shipping in mid-July, showed that after the fire was extinguished, nearly everything on the forward two-thirds of the ship in front of the deck house and bridge had been damaged. A few containers on the stern appear to have been blocked from the fire by the deckhouse. The vessel also appeared to be on an even keel and higher in the water after the dewatering efforts.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Trump: ""We're Going to be Buying Ships From South Korea""",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/trump-we-re-going-to-be-buying-ships-from-south-korea,,26/08/2025 06:50:56,,"Shipbuilding was at the top of the agenda in talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday, and the outcomes included a pledge from Trump to buy ships from Korea. In hopes of securing lower U.S. tariff rates and keeping the multibillion-dollar Korean auto industry competitive on the U.S. market, Seoul pledged an investment of $150 billion in America's shipbuilding sector. The bid was successful: Korea won a 10-point reduction in its tariff rate, putting its manufacturers on the same footing as competitors in Japan and the EU. To get the Trump administration to seal the deal, Korean trade officials came up with a slogan - ""Make American Shipbuilding Great Again,"" or MASGA. This gesture won the attention of the administration's trade negotiators, yielding a more favorable 15 percent tariff on Korean cars, computer chips and other exports. Trump's meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung was the first major bilateral press conference after the deal was concluded, and it appeared to yield a result that fulfills the hopes of Korean yards as well: an American intention to buy Korean hulls. ""We're going to be buying ships from South Korea,"" Trump said. ""We love their ships."" Trump told reporters that in the long term, ""we're also going to have them make ships here with our people, using our people, and we're going to go back into the shipbuilding business again."" As for timing, Trump emphasized that ""it takes a while"" and that ""shipbuilding is a tough one to start."" In addition to favoring Korean ships, Trump has also spoken highly of Finnish shipbuilding. Earlier this year, he told reporters that he has negotiated personally with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on the terms for purchasing used and new icebreakers from a non-U.S. shipyard. Two Finland-based yards, Helsinki Shipyard and Rauma, are said to be bidding for a program to build medium icebreakers for the U.S. Coast Guard (in cooperation with local partners in the United States). Korean state investment with U.S. guidance Coinciding with the Trump-Lee meeting on Monday, the U.S. private equity giant Cerberus Capital Management announced a partnership with Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai to launch a new ""maritime investment strategy"" focused on American shipbuilding opportunities. The new strategy, Cerberus Maritime, will also look for investment possibilities in the American maritime industry writ large, including maritime logistics, supply chains, infrastructure, ports and technology. HD Hyundai will provide shipbuilding expertise and serve as an anchor investor in the partnership. In addition, it will bring with it the Korean government's state sponsor for shipping and shipbuilding, Korea Development Bank (KDB). The policy bank is known as a lender of last resort for Korean shipyards; it was the largest shareholder in DSME before it arranged the yard's sale to Hanwha in 2022. In its investment role with HD Hyundai and Cerberus, KDB will ""facilitate investments into the Cerberus Maritime strategy"" in recognition of the initiative's importance to Korean national objectives. Cerberus and HD Hyundai have worked together in shipbuilding before. In 2022, Cerberus bought the former Hanjin-owned shipyard in Subic Bay, the biggest yard in the Philippines. Cerberus has leased out part of the space to HD Hyundai, which is investing $550 million at the site and plans to begin building product tankers there by early next year.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Whale Atlas: An Easy-to-Use Mapping Tool for Whale-Safer Global Navigation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/whale-atlas-an-easy-to-use-mapping-tool-for-whale-safer-global-navigation,,26/08/2025 04:48:00,,"2025 has been a tumultuous year for large whales in California and beyond. At least eight gray whales have been killed by ship strikes just in the Bay Area. While the majority of ship strikes go unobserved and undetected, researchers estimate that 80 endangered whales are fatally struck each year off the West Coast of the U.S. This reality was the impetus behind creating a new online portal which offers digitized details of whale conservation zones to make it easier for mariners planning multinational transits to understand and cooperate with whale-protection measures. In many places throughout the world, high-traffic shipping zones overlap with whale foraging areas and migration routes. Marine managers aim to reduce the risk of strikes by slowing ships down or asking them to avoid certain areas at certain times of the year. For the past ten years, Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies (BWBS) has engaged shipping companies, asking them to reduce their speeds voluntarily to a whale-safer level of 10 knots or less off the coast of California during peak whale migratory season. Programs like BWBS, which verifies cooperation with NOAA’s voluntary Vessel Speed Reduction (VSR) requests, work collaboratively with industry, and have been proven to be effective - reducing fatal strike risk by 50%. Where and when vessels reduce speeds is just as important as the slowing down itself. Resource managers use the best available science to determine the placement and timing of VSR zones. Video credit: Katherine Brook; vessel and whale footage by Adam Ernster Advancing global awareness and collaboration around whale protection measures Whale conservation programs and protection measures centered on reducing shipping impacts on whales exist around the world, including in the Strait of Gibraltar; Hellenic Trench; Bering and Salish Seas; Costa Rica; Gulfs of Panama, Hauraki and Saint Lawrence; and the Canadian Arctic. In 2023 and 2024 the World Shipping Council released a first-of-its-kind Whale Chart Report that compiled and outlined whale protection measures across the globe in order to raise awareness to mariners of opportunities to reduce biodiversity impacts. This included VSR zones, Areas to be Avoided (ATBAs), and Traffic Separation Schemes (TSSs), all aimed at directing vessel traffic to either reduce speeds within or stay away from critical whale habitat areas. Seeing an opportunity to make this valuable information more interactive and user-friendly, California Marine Sanctuary Foundation (CMSF) and the BWBS team developed an online platform to enhance how mariners access and engage with the information critical to understanding and cooperating with whale protection measures. CMSF is proud to introduce “Whale Atlas: A Mariners Guide to Whale-Safer Shipping” This new, online portal showcases digitized whale conservation zones and protection measures relevant to maritime shipping activities. It houses information on: Whale Atlas with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary selected, part of the NOAA voluntary VSR request, and Blue Whales Blue Skies program in California Whale conservation zones represent areas where mariners are requested to either: reduce speeds or avoid important habitats for a few months or year-round. Whale Atlas provides this information, as well as the source/administering agency, so mariners can zoom in and out of relevant geographies, learn about opportunities to operate more sustainably, download layers in relevant formats, and incorporate measures into their transit plans. CMSF and the BWBS team will regularly update the data to ensure that the conservation zones are current as guidance, data, and priority zones evolve. Maritime shipping is a global industry, and Whale Atlas brings us one step closer to ensuring that mariners consider whale-friendly shipping practices on the same global scale. Whale Atlas is now live and can be found on the new Protecting Blue Whales and Blue Skies website at https://bluewhalesblueskies.org/resources/.

Daryl Caudle has been sworn in as the Navy's newly-confirmed Chief of Naval Operations, taking over from Vice CNO Adm. Jim Kilby, who has been in the top post in an acting capacity since the dismissal of Adm. Lisa Franchetti in February. Caudle is a chemical engineer by training, and he commissioned into the Navy after graduating from North Carolina State; he holds a masters in physics and another in engineering management, plus a doctorate in organizational leadership. He has run Fleet Forces Command, the Navy's training and sustainment arm, since 2021; before that, he was a career submarine officer, culminating in an appointment as Commander, Submarine Forces - the Navy's top undersea domain officer. ""The sailor will be front and center in my vision throughout my tenure as CNO — hands down, no exception,"" Caudle said at his change of command ceremony. ""To ensure that they are ready to fight and win decisively — today, tomorrow and well into the future — we will view everything we do we through an operational lens focused on three priorities: the foundry, the fleet and the way we fight."" The new CNO also emphasized that the Navy must transform itself with AI, robotics, autonomous systems, hypersonics and other advanced technologies in order to maintain deterrence. ""The way we fight today will not be the way we fight tomorrow,"" Caudle said. Caudle has a reputation as a persistent solver of technical and organizational problems. He was selected at a time of pressing need: all of the Navy's new construction programs are behind schedule, and existing surface combatants, subs, amphibs and carriers face delays at repair yards, reducing availability. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan made clear that Caudle's troubleshooting skills were valued. ""Admiral Caudle, 'the honey badger,' is the right man for the job,"" Phelan said. ""He has a reputation for challenging the status quo, demanding results and refusing to accept excuses. I look forward to seeing that relentlessness pursuit of excellence and persistence pervade the halls of the Pentagon."" Caudle takes the helm at a time of rapid change for the Navy, both in personnel and in structure. Last week, Navy Reserve chief Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore and Navy Special Warfare commander Rear Adm. Milton ""Jamie"" Sands III were both dismissed from their posts. The Navy has not provided a reason for the dismissals; both leaders had been promoted to their positions in August 2024. In addition, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to pull responsibility for sub procurement out of the Navy's command structure and put it directly under the deputy secretary of defense, according to USNI. A new three-star ""submarine czar"" in the Pentagon will have budget control over sub maintenance, oversee the multibillion-dollar industry-boosting program for the sub supply chain, and work with the Navy to set requirements for new submarines - all functions that previously existed within Naval Sea Systems Command.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Two Canadian First Nations Buy Strategic Mining Port Terminal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/two-canadian-first-nations-buy-strategic-mining-port-terminal,,26/08/2025 03:00:06,,"In a first-of-its-kind transaction for Canada’s British Columbia Province, two First Nations have formed a partnership with a Canadian logistics company and will acquire the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal located in northwestern British Columbia along the U.S.-Canada border. It comes as there is an increasing push to tap Canada’s minerals and resources for economic advancement. ""This isn't just about us purchasing the first Indigenous majority-owned port in British Columbia's history,"" Andrew Robinson, chief executive officer of the Nisga'a Lisims Government, told The Canadian Press. “It's about economic sovereignty, reconciliation, and ensuring that wealth generated from our lands directly benefits our people and generations to come.” The Nisga’a Nation and the Tahltan Nation Development Limited Partnership are partnering with Arrow Transportation Systems to launch the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal. The new group is also consolidating the regional trucking operations of Arrow Transport’s Stewart Trucking Division and Tahltan-Arrow Transport to provide bulk transportation and logistics solutions in the Tahltan Territory. They note that Northwest BC is home to more than half the province’s exploration and mining sector. They believe the new partnership will provide improved access to deliver critical minerals from mine to market. The Port of Stewart is Canada’s most northerly ice-free port located to the north of Prince Rupert and supplying critical access to both British Columbia and Alberta. It is 80 to 90 miles from the Pacific Ocean at the end of the Portland Canal and provides support for the logging, mining, and exploration operations in the region. “Together, we are making history,” said Kerry Carlick, President, Tahltan Central Government. “The acquisition of this strategic asset will drive economic growth, create opportunities, and strengthen our nations’ self-determination.” The terminal primarily handles ore and logging with a breakbulk wharf and RoRo capabilities for barges. It can accommodate vessels up to approximately 50,000 dwt for the transport of ore and logs. One of the key customers is Newmont, which operates the Brucejacket and Red Chris mines in the indigenous communities’ territories and transports copper concentrate to market from the port. Newmont is strengthening its ties with the First Nations to support long-term growth of the port as a regional hub and provide the port’s new owners commercial certainty needed to move forward with the investments. The Province of British Columbia has also provided a C$5 million (US$3.6 million) grant to the two First Nations to support the purchase of the Port of Stewart Bulk Terminal.

Master Boat Builders Expands Shipbuilding Operations,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/master-boat-builders-expands-shipbuilding-operations,,26/08/2025 02:08:19,,"[By Master Boat Builders] Master Boat Builders, Inc. (Master Boat), an internationally recognized vessel and workboat manufacturer, today announced that it has invested $7.8 million to modernize and expand its shipbuilding operations in Mobile County by adding a new fabrication shop and floating drydock. The expansion project creates 85 new jobs, adding to Master Boat’s skilled workforce of more than 300 workers and further contributes to Mobile County’s strength in shipbuilding and maritime services. “This investment is about more than just expanding our ability to build more high-quality vessels. It underscores our commitment to increasing American shipbuilding capacity and we’re doing it right here along America’s Gulf Coast in Mobile County,” said Garrett Rice, President of Master Boat Builders. “By modernizing our facilities and growing our skilled workforce, we’re positioning our team to deliver critical vessels that support U.S. commerce and industry, all while training the next generation of American shipbuilders.” “Mobile’s maritime industry continues to thrive, and Master Boat’s investment underscores our region’s leadership in shipbuilding,” said Bradley Byrne, Mobile Chamber president and CEO. “By creating new jobs, retaining existing ones and investing in workforce development, this project is a powerful example of how our business community is growing alongside our thriving port and maritime economy.” The expansion includes the construction of a new fabrication building, a floating dry dock to support new harbor tug contracts, workforce training initiatives and infrastructure improvements. “Master Boat Builders is a 45-year-old, third generation, locally owned shipbuilder located in the Bayou. They have employed thousands of people over that span from local communities and currently employ over 300 people. If we can’t incentivize and support the growth of a business like Master, we shouldn’t be incentivizing anyone!” said District 3 Mobile County Commissioner Randall Dueitt. “This expansion not only secures and creates jobs for local families, but it also reinforces the fact that Mobile County is a leader in shipbuilding and maritime innovation and will be for years to come.” This project also supports the region’s ongoing workforce development and training initiatives, reflecting the growing demand for skilled talent within the maritime and shipbuilding sectors. “Master Boat’s expansion highlights the continued momentum of Alabama’s maritime industry and reinforces Mobile County’s position as a hub for shipbuilding and repair,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “This investment not only creates quality jobs but also strengthens the region’s capacity to support a vital sector of our state’s economy.” Work on this expansion began October of 2024 and is expected to be fully operational by October of this year.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Mediterranean NGO Reports Libya Shot and Damaged its Rescue Boat,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/mediterranean-ngo-reports-libya-shot-and-damaged-its-rescue-boat,,26/08/2025 01:59:48,,"The NGO SOS Mediterranee released details on an encounter in the Mediterranean on Sunday, August 24, in which it says the Libyan Coast Guard opened fire on its ship and continued to attack the ship for up to 20 minutes. The group released pictures showing shattered bridge windows among other damage, which it reports the Libyans inflicted on the small rescue boat Ocean Viking. SOS Mediterranee has been operating the Ocean Viking, a former North Sea supply vessel for the oil and gas industry, since 2019 under charter from the International Red Cross. Built in 1986 and now registered in Norway, the ship was outfitted with three rigid rescue boats and a medical facility. The group reports it made two rescues on August 23, taking aboard 47 people, including nine unaccompanied minors, who it says are mostly from war-torn Somalia. The Italians had ordered the Ocean Viking to head to Marina di Carrara, a 700 nautical mile trip that would have required 3.5 days, but they received permission to remain in the Mediterranean searching for a third boat with migrants. The Ocean Viking, they report, was 40 nautical miles north of the Libyan coast when they were confronted by a patrol boat on Sunday afternoon. According to their account of the situation, the Libyans first demanded that the vessel leave the area and head north immediately. They said the instructions were radioed in English and Arabic. Today at 3pm, the #OceanViking has been deliberately and violently attacked in intl. waters by the Libyan Coast Guard, who fired hundreds of shots at our ship. The 87 survivors and crew on board were not wounded. We are currently working on a detailed reconstruction of events. pic.twitter.com/i8RkuYI1ep Without warning or an ultimatum, SOS Mediterranee reports that two soldiers aboard the Libyan boat began shooting at the Ocean Viking. They are claiming the patrol boat circled the vessel, shooting for up to 20 minutes. Four windows on the bridge were broken, multiple antennas were destroyed, and several bullets struck and damaged the three fast rescue boats, along with other equipment. None of the migrants or crew were injured. The Ocean Viking issued a mayday and called NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian. They report that they were told an Italian navy ship was the closest NATO asset, but it did not return calls. The captain of the Ocean Viking started his vessel for Syracuse, Italy, but the authorities later ordered them to sail to Augusta. SOS Mediterranee is demanding a full investigation into the incident. It is also pointing out that the vessel that attacked them was one of two patrol boats Italy gifted to Libya in June 2023. There have been similar incidents in the past with the Libyan Coast Guard and the rescue vessels. This one, however, was more aggressive and longer. The group says its volunteers and the survivors were clearly threatened and felt in serious danger.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
U.S. Coast Guard Sets Record With 34-Tonne Cocaine Offload,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-sets-record-with-34-tonne-cocaine-offload,,26/08/2025 01:48:45,,"The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Hamilton has offloaded a record-setting 34 tonnes of cocaine at the pier in Port Everglades, a quantity of the drug rarely seen in one place. It is the service's largest single cocaine offload on record, and the Coast Guard estimated its value at a (much-reduced) price of just $470 million. An overabundance of South American cocaine exports have pushed down prices in export markets, increasing volume and reducing its value at the same time. USCGC Hamilton offloaded cocaine collected in 19 separate interdictions near Aruba, Haiti, Venezuela, Curacao, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Bonaire, and a variety of high-seas locations in the Eastern Pacific, from Ecuador to Mexico. Six different Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy vessels participated in the seizures, but Hamilton played the largest role, conducting 11 interdictions and seizing a record 47,000 pounds of cocaine. Cocaine bust off Bonaire, facilitated by destroyer USS Cole (USCG) “Team Hamilton with our partners, worked incredibly hard the last several months to safeguard the American public from the dangers of illicit narcotics entering the United States,” said Capt. John B. McWhite, commanding officer of Hamilton. “The commitment and sacrifice of our deployed service members and their families, who forego time together for the protection of our Nation, are to be celebrated.” A large share of the cocaine traffic through the Caribbean is destined for Europe, not the United States. European customers account for about one fifth of global cocaine demand, and have historically paid a premium for the drug. The Coast Guard priced out the shipment's U.S. wholesale value at about $14,000 per kilo, a fraction of the 2024 EU average of about $35,000 per kilo; EU street and wholesale prices have fallen since the first quarter of 2025, according to multiple European media reports, driven down by an abundant supply and a price war between cartels.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Zim Confirms Turkey’s Immediate Ban on Shipping Associated with Israel,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/zim-confirms-turkey-s-immediate-ban-on-shipping-associated-with-israel,,26/08/2025 00:58:53,,"Zim confirmed the earlier reports that Turkey has begun turning away ships associated with Israel. The company, which is the ninth-largest container carrier, reports it is rerouting ships scheduled to call at Turkish ports and working on a mitigation plan. In a stock exchange filing on Monday, August 25, Zim writes, “It received a notice from the Turkish Port Authorities through the company’s local agent in Turkey, that as a result of a new regulation adopted in Turkey, vessels that are either owned, managed or operated by an entity related to Israel will not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports.” The change was said to be effective immediately as of last Friday. The Globes newspaper in Israel reports that one of the company’s ships was turned away from Istanbul last Friday. It writes that the vessel was forced to proceed to Piraeus, Greece, and that there is no clear solution for the cargo scheduled to be loaded or unloaded in Istanbul. The new regulation also impacts all vessels that are carrying military cargo destined to Israel, which Zim says it was told would not be permitted to berth in Turkish ports. Also, Turkish-flagged vessels are prohibited from calling at Israeli ports. Globes reports that while it is an expansion of the trade embargo Turkey imposed 15 months ago, it says shipping companies are still waiting for clear instructions from the Turkish government. It says other major carriers, such as MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, are seeking clear instructions. A ship’s flag is said not to be a guarantee that it will be permitted into a Turkish port. It is not the first country to bar Israeli shipping, for example, Malaysia took a similar step in December 2023, but it is a minor trading partner with Israel. Turkey and Israel had a large trade flow, and even after the embargo, trade continued between the countries. The ban comes as Zim has already been under pressure. Last week, the company reported a 15 percent decline in revenues in the second quarter of 2025 and a 38 percent decline in earnings (EBITDA) for the quarter. Carried container volume was down six percent in the second quarter to 895,000 TEU, but box volume for the six months was up year-over-year to 1.84 million TEU. Management cited the company’s agility and ability to respond to the challenging market conditions. Based on its outlook, it raised its midpoint guidance for the full year 2025 despite the softness in the quarter. Today, it however, warned that if Turkey’s ban remains unchanged, it is expected to negatively impact financial and operating results. Recently, there have been market rumors that management was exploring a possible buyout of Zim with an investment group. Zim went public in January 2021 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
NTSB: Barge Grounded in Prince William Sound After ATB's Lines Parted,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-barge-grounded-in-prince-william-sound-because-atb-s-lines-parted,,26/08/2025 00:41:25,,"The National Transportation Safety Board has released the results of its investigation into the loss of the barge Cordova Provider, which ran aground in Prince William Sound and suffered so much damage that it was declared a total loss. Cordova Provider began life as an ice-class oil recovery barge, but in 2005 it was modified with a notch to serve as one half of a unique ATB. The other half, the tug Krystal Sea, was built at the Western Towboat yard at the same time. Instead of coupler pins like those found on an Articouple or Intercon system, the Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider fit together with a wedge-and-recess system that had no moving parts. Three wedges on the tug - one on the bow, one to port and one to starboard - would line up with corresponding recesses within the notch at the stern of the barge. Changes in relative draft could be compensated for by backing out of the notch and re-entering at a different set of recesses. Instead of a positive mechanical connection, the Krystal Sea was held in the slot by four breast lines (push lines) running from the barge to winches on the stern of the towboat, much like an inland towboat. When Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider were built, the lines and bridles were steel wire rope; the operator later exchanged the wire rope for Dyneema soft lines, which were lighter and safer for the crew to handle over the side. Krystal Sea/Cordova Provider operated in this configuration to move breakbulk cargo around Prince William Sound, within sheltered waters. On the morning of January 10, 2025, the ATB got under way from Valdez, headed across the sound for Cordova. The forecast called for winds of 45 knots, consistent with wintertime weather along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Six-foot seas were expected in the sound, rising to 10 feet after midnight. The ATB's call in Cordova was completed swiftly, and the ATB departed for Whittier at 2110. By 0200 hours the next morning, as Krystal Sea crossed the middle of the sound, seas rose to 4-6 feet, with wind and waves on the port quarter of the tug - typical conditions, according to the crew. At 0250, the mate on watch heard a line snap, followed by three more. All four of the Dyneema lines that held the tug and barge together had parted in the middle, and the Cordova Provider was adrift. The master came to the bridge and maneuvered to see if there was a way to regain control of the barge, but the surface conditions made this too dangerous to attempt. Instead, the Coast Guard put the master in contact with the operator of the escort tug Latouche, moored nearby. The Latouche arrived on scene at 0550 hours and attempted to retrieve the barge by getting a line onto a bitt on its stern. The crew succeeded, but the line parted shortly after. Latouche was forced to give up the chase as Cordova Provider drifted into dangerous shallows off Axel Lind Island. The barge then ran aground, sustained extensive hull damage on the rocks, and partially sank. It was later refloated, towed offshore and disposed of through sinking in deeper water. Investigators' focus turned to the lines that connected the two vessels as an ATB unit. The operator had switched to soft shackles and Dyneema pennant lines in 2023-4, and the captain had inspected the rigging about five days before the casualty, finding nothing amiss. After the casualty, a technician from the firm that assembled the lines determined that they were in fair to good condition, with minor abrasion. Three had parted in the middle of the pennant section, and one parted at the soft shackle. All components were rated for a 100,000-pound breaking strength. NTSB concluded that the lines likely parted due to shock loading, with cascading failure after the first line parted. As the tug had served in similar conditions before, the reason for the break on this particular trip is unknown.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Northern Lights Injects First CO2 in Subsea Storage Well,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/northern-lights-injects-first-co2-in-subsea-storage-well,,25/08/2025 23:51:55,,"The pioneering Northern Lights project has injected its first shipment of carbon dioxide for long-term storage in a subsea reservoir off the coast of Norway, launching a long-anticipated service backed by Equinor (as operator), TotalEnergies, Shell and the Norwegian government. “With CO2 safely stored below the seabed, we mark a major milestone. This demonstrates the viability of carbon capture, transport and storage as a scalable industry. With the support from the Norwegian government and in close collaboration with our partners, we have successfully transformed this project from concept to reality,” said the CEO of Equinor, Anders Opedal, in a statement Monday. Northern Lights is the first commercial-scale project of its kind, and it is the backbone of a constellation of Norwegian carbon-capture initiatives. The offshore reservoir serves as the final destination for carbon from a variety of onshore industries, notably the Heidelberg cement plant in the town of Brevik and the Hafslund waste incineration plant in Oslo. Other future users include Yara, Stockholm Exergi and Orsted, among others, through the provision of long-distance CO2 shipping. An initial small-scale liquefied CO2 shipping service is provided by K Line. Now that Northern Lights is up and running, its backers want to expand it rapidly. The current capacity is just 1.5 million tonnes per year, about the same as the annual emissions of 320,000 non-electric cars. With backing from the EU, its owners plan to add more infrastructure to more than triple that number to 5.0 million tonnes per year. This second development phase should be completed and ready for operation in late 2028. The scope includes an additional jetty, nine new storage tanks, and more injection wells. Over the long term, Equinor wants to have 30-50 million tonnes a year of CO2 transport and storage capacity by 2035, primarily in Europe and in the U.S.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Italian Coast Guard Responds as Mega MSC Cruise Ship Loses Propulsion Power,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/italian-coast-guard-responds-as-mega-msc-cruise-ship-loses-propulsion-power,,25/08/2025 23:20:27,,"MSC World Europa, one of the largest cruise ships in the world with a reported 8,500 people aboard, lost propulsion early Monday, August 25, off the coast of Italy. The incident drew wide media attention with sensational reports saying it had grounded or crashed. The Guardia Costiera responded to the ship, and it was emphasized that the vessel was never in any physical danger. Introduced in 2022 as the first MSC cruise ship to exceed the 200,000 gross ton mark, the ship was making a week-long cruise circuit in the Western Mediterranean and sailing between Genoa and Naples when, according to passengers, the vessel stopped at approximately 0530 Monday morning. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard control center at approximately 0730, and two patrol boats and a helicopter were dispatched to survey the situation. At 215,863 gross tons, the massive 1,094-foot (333-meter) vessel is reported to have a total of 8,585 people aboard, including 6,496 passengers on an end of summer cruise and 2,089 crewmembers. Some of the passengers were due to disembark today in Naples, and others were waiting to join the ship. The Coast Guard placed officers aboard the ship to survey the situation and reported it was told that the ship was experiencing an electrical problem with its propulsion. The ship is one of the largest to be fueled with LNG. The ship uses GE Power Conversion’s in-board electric propulsion system using two 25 MW induction motors that drive two conventional fixed-pitch propellers via direct shaftlines. It was built by Chantiers de l’Atlantique and is third in size only to Royal Caribbean International’s sister ships Icon and Star of the Seas and the Oasis class of cruise ships. MSC introduced a second ship of the class this year and has ordered four more World Class ships. Passengers were reported calm while the ship was drifting approximately eight miles off the coast of the Italian island of Ponza. The ship was able to continue to run its generators and was maintaining passenger services. Two tugs from the ports of Gioia Tauro and Naples were dispatched, and plans were being made to tow the ship, if necessary, the approximately 50 miles to Naples. However, by early afternoon, MSC Cruises was reporting that the crew had been able to initially restore partial propulsion. The Coast Guard did a further inspection, and the ship was moving at 15 knots with a Coast Guard escort to Naples. It docked at 2100 local time on Monday night. MSC said technicians would continue to repair and inspect the cruise ship. Passengers were proceeding with the disembarkation and embarkation. The plan called for the ship to resume its cruise on Tuesday, sailing for Messina.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
"Finnish Prosecutors Demand Jail Time for Captain, Officers of Shadow Tanker",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/finnish-prosecutors-demand-jail-time-for-captain-officers-of-shadow-tanker,,25/08/2025 22:31:48,,"The trial for the captain and two senior officers of the shadow fleet tanker Eagle S began on Monday, August 25, in the Helsinki District Court. They are facing charges ranging from aggravated sabotage and aggravated telecommunications interference to lesser charges of vandalism and endangering public safety. The trial stems from the December 25, 2024, damage by the 74,000 dwt tanker Eagle S to the undersea power cable between Finland and Estonia, as well as four telecommunications cables. Prosecutors told the court that the laden tanker, which was registered in the Cook Islands, dragged its anchor for a distance of at least 55 miles in the Baltic. For the first time, they also said in court that the vessel appeared to slow as it passed over the cables, and they contended that if the Finnish authorities had not intervened and seized the tanker, it would have done more damage as it continued its trip. The prosecution is reported to be demanding jail time for the master of the vessel, Captain Davit Vadatchkoria, a Georgia national, Robert Egizaryan, another Georgian who was the first officer, and Santosh Kumar Chaurasia, an Indian who was the second officer on the vessel. The Finnish news outlet Yle reports the prosecution called for sentences of two and a half years in prison, which is near the minimum of two years under the law. The maximum for aggravated sabotage (criminal mischief) is 10 years in prison, while the aggravated charges for interfering with telecommunications are up to five years. They are saying the charges are “aggravated” because their actions were intentional and deliberate. Prosecutors assert the crew was required to operate the vessel safely. The three individuals are pleading not guilty to the charges. The captain speaking to the Swedish Yle last week said it was a “maritime accident.” Defense lawyers reiterated the claim that it was an accident. The captain claimed to Yle that no alarms sounded and that they did not sense changes in the ship. In court, it was revealed that the ship stopped at midday due to an engine problem and was experiencing heavy weather in the Baltic. They have not said when the anchor was deployed, but they are saying a broken safety pin could have caused it to come loose. The court was also told that the braking system for the anchor was heavily rusted and inoperable. The Vessel Traffic Service had made an inquiry to the ship during the afternoon, at which time they said the second officer denied that the anchor was down. It was not until 1845 that they were told they were dragging something on the seafloor and instructed to raise the anchor. The officers claimed that a check of the mooring deck at dinner time that night was not safe because of the weather. The court will also have to take up the question of jurisdiction. The UAE-based shipping company that managed the Eagle S contends Finland lacks authority because the damage happened in international waters and points out that Finland was not endangered because it sends power to Estonia. During the hearing today, the court was told a manager from the shipping company had instructed the captain to delete a report showing the vessel had crossed over the damaged cables. The prosecution is also asking the court to consider compensation for the damage and repairs. The Finnish and Estonian companies have said it cost them more than $70 million to repair the cables, which were out of service for months. Finland conducted a Port State inspection on the Eagle S at the beginning of January and reported 53 deficiencies ranging from fire safety to structural conditions and violations of the Master Labor Contract for seafarers. They reported that radar and firefighting equipment were inoperable and problems in the cargo pump room. The vessel was detained in Finland for 53 days before it was permitted to sail. The incident raised awareness of the dangers to the subsea infrastructure and the issues with the shadow fleet. Baltic and Scandinavian countries increased their monitoring of the shadow fleet and began challenging the vessels on documentation, including insurance coverage. The countries were also successful in getting NATO to deploy additional resources to the Baltic and North Sea. Russia has responded, denying knowledge of the vessels’ actions, and calling the Western efforts piracy, vowing to defend the shadow fleet tankers.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Egypt and Greece Reject Turkish-Libyan EEZ Claim,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/egypt-and-greece-reject-turkish-libyan-eez-claim,,25/08/2025 22:31:21,,"Egypt and Greece have rejected a bilateral accord first tabled in 2019, which seeks to establish a maritime boundary between Turkey and Libya in the Mediterranean. The accord appears likely to be signed up to by the government in eastern Libya, having been agreed between Turkey and the internationally recognized government in western Libya six years ago. The purpose of the accord is to facilitate oil exploration, by establishing a boundary within the sea corridor claimed by Libya and Turkey. When the accord was originally tabled in 2019, it was met with almost universal rejection. It was regarded as a breach of the International Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), by the United States, the EU, Russia and the Arab League amongst many, but in particular by Greece, Egypt and Cyprus because the Libyan-Turkish corridor was superimposed over their own UNCLOS-backed claims for 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones. The Turkish-Libyan accord is likely to be hotly contested, and it is not clear what lies behind the revived claim. It is possible that some of those who were originally vehemently opposed to the carve-up have now switched sides, conjecturing that under the Trump administration, potential economic gains could outweigh previous political understandings and the potential breaches of UNCLOS - and also believing that the revival of the Libyan-Turkish claim could become part of a settlement of Libya’s long-running political crisis. Turkey is already in dispute with Greece and Cyprus over exploitation of oil and gas reserves to the south of Cyprus, among many other issues. Greece and Turkey (and Turkey's Ottoman predecessors) have spent centuries contesting territorial control over the region, most recently including the partition of Cyprus in 1974 and the ongoing dispute over islands and maritime zones in the Aegean.

Marie Maersk Resumes Voyage with No Visible Damage From Container Fire,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/marie-maersk-resumes-voyage-with-no-visible-damage-from-container-fire,,25/08/2025 20:39:24,,"The large Maersk containership, Marie Maersk, which has been battling a container fire for nearly two weeks, is reportedly back underway after teams determined it is safe for the vessel to proceed. With the help of external firefighting teams and equipment brought out to the ship while it was off Africa, Maersk has reported that the fire was contained. The company released two pictures taken on Friday, August 22, when a supply vessel reached the scene with additional firefighting equipment. There is no visible fire damage to any of the boxes aboard what appears to be a heavily laden vessel. The ship has a rated capacity of just over 19,000 TEU. “After an inspection of affected areas of the vessel and careful consideration of all aspects together with authorities and class, it was deemed safe that Marie Maersk resumes her eastbound voyage around Cape of Good Hope on Sunday. Her next port of destination is under final review, and we will inform as soon as it has been decided,” Maersk reported. Marie Maersk with no visible fire damage to the containers aboard (Maersk) The containership had spent a week lying off the west coast of Liberia after smoke was first detected coming from containers on August 13. The ship was moved closer to the coast so that fire equipment could be brought out. Late last week, the ship rounded the western coast of Africa and was then met with additional supplies offshore near Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire). A supply vessel with additional firefighting equipment reached the Marie Maersk on Friday evening and transferred special equipment onboard on Saturday, August 23. The AIS signal for the ship shows it now underway with a declared destination of Cape Town, South Africa. Its routing called for a stop in Malaysia before proceeding to China. The company has repeated said the navigational equipment and machinery was not damaged, and the ship was stable. Maersk reports that the external firefighting team will remain on board, and “special measures” have been put in place to ensure a safe journey. An intermediate stop might be implemented, Maersk said, depending on the optimal place for handling the damaged containers and to mitigate onward disruptions in its network. Contingencies are in place in case the planned journey needs to be revised en route. The company has not advised on the location of the boxes that were smoking or the nature of the cargo. In general, mis-declared and improperly packaged cargo is one of the most frequent dangers cited for the containership. Maersk has said the full extent of the damage would not be known until the vessel reaches a port and unloads containers from the area where the fire was located.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Ukrainian Drones Damage Russia’s Ust-Luga Oil and Gas Terminal,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ukrainian-drones-damage-russia-s-ust-luga-oil-and-gas-terminal,,25/08/2025 19:43:58,,"Ust-Luga, one of the main terminals in Russia’s oil and gas industry, was damaged by a long-range attack from Ukraine. It is the second time since the war began that Ukraine has been successful in attacking the facility, and it comes as both sides have increased their attacks against the energy infrastructure. The Governor of the Leningrad Region, Alexander Drozdenko, started posting alerts about UAV attacks on Saturday, August 23, which continued into Sunday. The reports initially placed the drones at various points around the region, with Drozdenko reporting that at least 10 drones were destroyed on Saturday, prompting him to issue a warning for citizens to “refrain from being near industrial zones and enterprises, as well as visiting public places.” On Sunday, August 24, Drozdenko acknowledged that at least 10 drones had attacked the port of Ust-Luga, although he said they were all destroyed. Debris from a drone was, however, reported to have caused a fire at the Novatek terminal. The reports said there were no casualties. The extent of the damage is unclear, and many of the photos being posted online are from a 2024 fire at the plant. Drozdenko said the fire had been “localized” and that the fuel tanks were not damaged. By Sunday afternoon, the report was that the fire at Ust-Luga had been extinguished and Novatek was starting repairs and restoration work. The Ust-Luga terminal in the innermost part of the Gulf of Finland is a key  facility for export of oil and gas. It’s evidently been hit by  long range drones. pic.twitter.com/d6ChcgQQGJ Looks like Ust-Luga was hit by a Ukrainian Shahed-style drone. Some 600 miles from Ukraine. https://t.co/948Ma4zBEz pic.twitter.com/YTlQPjaETo It is believed the gas processing equipment was struck, taking the plant offline. Some reports are suggesting it could take months to repair, which would be a major blow to Russia’s oil and gas industry. Novatek has been operating the facility, which is located about 70 miles west of St. Petersburg, since 2013. Reports are that it handles more than seven million tons of gas condensate as well as more than four million tons of heavy and light oil. It is also a supplier of marine and jet fuel, kerosene, and diesel fuel. The daring attack was staged more than 600 miles from Ukraine and was part of a larger assault on the energy system. Russia’s defense ministry is saying 95 drones were launched across 14 regions and all were downed with minor damage. It acknowledged 13 drones destroyed over Ust-Luga, as well as some damage to a nuclear power plant. Russia has been striking Ukraine’s fuel import and distribution network and facilities. Last week, a tanker was reportedly damaged while unloading at the port of Izmail on the Danube.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 09:43:50
Video: Chilean Navy Rescues Survivor From the Rocks in Tierra Del Fuego,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-chilean-navy-rescues-survivor-from-the-rocks-in-tierra-del-fuego,,25/08/2025 05:57:42,,"Against all odds, the Chilean Navy has rescued a survivor from a fishing vessel that went missing off Tierra del Fuego on Thursday. The four fishermen aboard the vessel were harvesting sea urchins, and the crew disappeared along with their vessel, the Ana Belen. Good Samaritan fishermen located the survivor - who was wearing a black wetsuit - in an area known locally as the Bahia Sea, near the western entrance to Beagle Channel. The maze of inlets at the westward fringe of Tierra del Fuego bears the full brunt of the region's stormy weather, and this creates real challenges for shore access. The survivor could not be reached by helicopter because of powerful downdrafts from the cliffs above, and heaving surf made it impossible to get a small boat near to the rocky shoreline. To complete the retrieval of the survivor, a Chilean Navy helicopter dropped a rescue swimmer into the water near the rocks, and he swam through the waves and climbed up on shore to reach the fisherman. Then, together, they got back into the frigid water and swam out to a pickup point. ""The extraction lasted approximately 25 minutes, which was vitally important since they had to swim to the rescue boat that was waiting for them in a safe place,"" said Serio Surriba, commander of the naval aviation unit in Puerto Williams. The survivor has been identified as Juan Andrés Rojas Casco, a Paraguayan national. The search for the three other missing fishermen continues, and the Chilean Navy has pledged to make ""every effort to find the rest of the crew.""

"""Black Box"" on Tanker Eagle S Failed to Record During Cable Break",https://maritime-executive.com/article/black-box-on-tanker-eagle-s-failed-to-record-during-cable-break,,28/08/2025 05:52:48,,"Investigators who boarded the tanker Eagle S after it severed a subsea power cable found that its voyage data recorder (VDR) had failed to record the time period of the casualty - not because of tampering, but because of an inherent design flaw that turned it off. On Christmas Day, a power transmission cable and multiple telecom cables in the Gulf of Finland were suddenly severed. Eagle S happened to be under way in the area, and her trackline corresponded to the damage sites. Within hours, Finnish police boarded the vessel by helicopter and diverted it to Porvoo for arrest and examination. At the time of interdiction, the tanker had its port side anchor chain in the water, and a follow-up survey found a 50-nautical-mile drag line on the bottom - along with the damaged anchor. In early March, Finnish authorities released Eagle S, but detained the master and the first and second officers to await criminal charges. Prosecutors have charged them with aggravated vandalism and aggravated interference with telecommunications, with potential penalties of up to 2.5 years in jail if convicted. The trial is now under way. Any investigation of potential wrongdoing at sea will start with VDR data, including key parameters of vessel status (heading, speed, engine RPM) and audio of crew conversations on the bridge. But investigators found that Eagle S' VDR had ceased recording on the afternoon of December 18, before the incident, and resumed at about 1300 hours on the 25th. Eagle S crossed and severed the subsea power cable about 30 minutes earlier, while the VDR was not recording. The investigators found no evidence of tampering with the VDR, but discovered a curious technical cause. The VDR was an older design from the 2000s, and its time stamp system relied on GPS timing signals, without which it could not function. When the Eagle S sailed into the Russian end of the Gulf of Finland - one of the world's most GPS-denied environments - it lost its GPS signal, and the VDR's time reverted to 2005. The system then auto-deleted these older 2005 files to save space in its limited memory, according to YLE. When Eagle S regained GPS, recording resumed - but only after the ship had already cut the power cable. The officers maintain that they could not reasonably have known that they were dragging an anchor along the bottom, but prosecutors contend that they were negligent in overlooking it. One key piece of evidence presented to the jury this week is an electronic log of the ship's speed, which dropped precipitously in the minutes before the cable break, falling from 12 knots to 9 knots. Engine RPM fell at the same time. The prosecutors contend that the speed change was a clear indication that something was wrong, and that the crew should have checked the anchors. However, the defense countered that the bridge team had noticed the speed drop and contacted the chief engineer, who informed them that the vessel was having engine problems. The chief engineer (who has not been charged) told the court that the engine was indeed having problems on that voyage, and had been an issue well before the casualty. The officers did not think to go forward and check the anchors, the defense contends, because they were relying upon the chief engineer's professional assessment.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 15:22:53

The investigators found no evidence of tampering with the VDR, but discovered a curious technical cause. The VDR was an older design from the 2000s, and its time stamp system relied on GPS timing signals, without which it could not function. When the Eagle S sailed into the Russian end of the Gulf of Finland - one of the world's most GPS-denied environments - it lost its GPS signal, and the VDR's time reverted to 2005. The system then auto-deleted these older 2005 files to save space in its limited memory, according to YLE. When Eagle S regained GPS, recording resumed - but only after the ship had already cut the power cable. The officers maintain that they could not reasonably have known that they were dragging an anchor along the bottom, but prosecutors contend that they were negligent in overlooking it. One key piece of evidence presented to the jury this week is an electronic log of the ship's speed, which dropped precipitously in the minutes before the cable break, falling from 12 knots to 9 knots. Engine RPM fell at the same time. The prosecutors contend that the speed change was a clear indication that something was wrong, and that the crew should have checked the anchors. However, the defense countered that the bridge team had noticed the speed drop and contacted the chief engineer, who informed them that the vessel was having engine problems. The chief engineer (who has not been charged) told the court that the engine was indeed having problems on that voyage, and had been an issue well before the casualty. The officers did not think to go forward and check the anchors, the defense contends, because they were relying upon the chief engineer's professional assessment.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 15:42:19

NTSB: Delayed Emergency Response Contributed to Collision and $1M in Damage,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-delayed-emergency-response-contributed-to-collision-and-1m-in-damage,,28/08/2025 20:30:27,,"The National Transportation Safety Board is out with a new warning for crews about testing and training to respond to a loss of steering control due to a malfunction. It concluded in an investigation into a 2023 collision in the Houston Ship Channel that the failure of a small rubber sheath and a delayed response by the crew to implement emergency steering procedures contributed to the collision after a component failed in the primary steering system. The multi-purpose carrier BBC Africa (7,530 dwt) was departing Houston, Texas, on August 25, 2023, when the vessel suddenly lost steering control and veered off course, striking the docked bulker Common Faith (57,000 dwt), which was at the Anderson Grain Terminal in Houston. The post ballast tank of the bulker was punctured, along with damage to the shell plating, which cost a total of $467,000 to repair. The BBC Africa suffered damage to its bulbous bow, hull, and shell plating and forward bulwarks, costing $700,000 to repair. There were no injuries or pollution reported from the incident. NTSB reconstructed the events using AIS data and crew interviews. The BBC Africa’s Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was not functioning, but the vessel had permission to sail while repairs were being arranged. On the morning of August 25, pre-departure testing of the system on the BBC Africa showed no problems. The second officer tested the steering gear, checked rudder movements, and ran the steering gear pumps, while engineers also completed a pre-departure checklist. The master also tested steering from the port bridge wing and told the pilot aboard that everything was “in good working order.” About 10 minutes after having gotten underway, the ship was making speeds up to 6.8 knots, and everything was going smoothly. The pilot released the escort tug, and the pilot and master ordered that maneuvering control (bow thruster, main propulsion engine control, and steering) be transferred from the port bridge wing to the main control station on the bridge. The chief officer pressed the button to activate the controls on the bridge. The pilot then gave a command for starboard 10, and the helmsman confirmed adjusting the rudder. Sensing the vessel was not turning at the expected rate, the pilot ordered starboard 20 and then hard to starboard. It was then that the chief officer realized the indicator light on the main control station had gone off and tried pressing it several times to reengage the controls. The rudder indicator was showing a hard port position of 30 degrees. The master then switched the vessel’s steering to emergency override mode and got the rudder back to 30 degrees starboard. The pilot also ordered full astern, and the master then put the bow thruster to 100 percent starboard thrust. However, it was too late, and they hit the docked bulker. Investigators were unable to replicate the failure, but working with the system manufacturer determined that a component failure had caused the system to fail. The company’s investigation found the rubber on the joystick (tiller) had invisible cracks that let moisture into the control unit, which contributed to the loss of the electrical signal. The shipping company, on advice from the manufacturer, changed the bridge wing steering control tillers, the “in command” push buttons, and the main power supply transformer. They made the same changes on two other vessels with similar control systems. The report says that the primary cause was the equipment failure. However, they also noted a stressful situation with short reaction time due to the vessel being in the confines of the port. The NTSB notes the crew had gone through training and regular drills, but recommended further training, saying that the delayed response from the ship’s crew to implement the emergency steering procedure from the bridge contributed to the vessel striking the docked bulker. The steering gear manufacturer also issued a safety bulletin. It highlighted incidents with systems manufactured between 2002 and 2009, noting that they had malfunctioned due to a weakness with the protective rubber and the micro switches. The bulletin said the consequence of the failing micro switches could lead to unintended rudder movement.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 21:29:38
Video: Ukraine Damages Russian Missile Boat in the Sea of Azov,https://maritime-executive.com/article/video-ukraine-damages-russian-missile-boat-in-the-sea-of-azov,,28/08/2025 18:22:36,,"Ukraine military intelligence has released a video showing one of its one-way attack aerial drones attacking a Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette in the Sea of Azov. The corvette was hit and damaged on August 28, but it is not yet clear if the vessel has been able to recover to port. Defence Intelligence of Ukraine strikes russian ""buyan-m"" corvette — a carrier of ""kalibr"" cruise missiles — in the Azov Sea : https://t.co/Q1lOahxlqy pic.twitter.com/SMPEc1b3Z6 The attack is noteworthy because of the location of the attack. The Sea of Azov is effectively a Russian lake, Ukraine having lost its control of coastline in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in 2022. Hence Ukraine will have had to fly the attack drone either through Russian land-based air defenses in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, or taken a longer route over the sea and around Crimea. The drone’s pilots will then need to have locked onto the target at this long range. Location of the corvette when struck in the Sea of Azov (45°42′N 35°18′E ) (Google Earth, Landsat Copernicus, CJRC) Ukraine has demonstrated it can do this against static targets at extreme range. However, to be able to do so against a moving target at long range is technically a considerable accomplishment. This should once again cause Russian naval commanders to consider the security of their naval assets even in ports far distant from Crimea such as Novorossiysk, to where vessels have already been pulled back for safety. The attack may have been mounted by Ukraine to demonstrate that it can control sea approaches to the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, which Russia has recently sought to open to foreign shipping. Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation) Buyan-M Class corvettes are primarily designed for littoral coastal defense, and are the mainstay of both what remains of the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. They are however armed with two vertical launch cells, each able to hold four Kalibr missiles. The Kalibr is designed to be an anti-ship weapon, but has frequently been used to hit ground targets in Ukraine. In its land-attack version, the Kalibr has a range of 1,500 miles, and can therefore hit targets anywhere in Ukraine form the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.",Maritime Executive,28/08/2025 21:29:38

The program administered by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is critical as it transports fuel supplies for the U.S. Department of Defense. Crowley Stena Marine Solutions, the joint venture between Crowley and Stena Bulk, reports that MARAD recently approved operating the MR tanker CS Anthem under the Tanker Security Program. The companies note that the vessel will advance the nation’s strategic sealift capabilities. ""The addition of the CS Anthem demonstrates our commitment to strengthening U.S. maritime security and providing reliable, U.S.-crewed tanker capacity in support of national defense,"" said Tucker Gilliam, vice president of fleet operations for Crowley Shipping. ""Together with Stena Bulk, we are proud to continue advancing solutions that serve both commercial and government energy transportation needs."" The new vessel is largely a swap with the same characteristics as the damaged ship. Built in 2017, CS Anthem had been operating for India’s Scorpio. It is 49,990 dwt compared with 49,729 dwt for the Stena Immaculate, which was also built in 2017, and which it replaces. The databases show CS Antheim was recently transferred to the U.S. flag from the Marshall Islands and now has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida. Crowley is responsible for crewing and managing the tanker under a bareboat charter through the joint venture. The company also manages the tankers Stena Imperative and Stena Impeccable in the Tanker Security Program. Stena Immaculate was anchored off the east coast of England after transporting a cargo of jet fuel. It was waiting for its berth when the containership Solong hit the tanker at anchor. The resulting fire engulfed both vessels, but Crowley’s crew acted heroically, starting fire suppression systems before they were safely evacuated. The tanker survived with portions of its cargo intact. They arranged for another tanker to receive the fuel, and the damaged vessel was towed to Great Yarmouth in the UK, where it appears to still be berthed. The Solong recently arrived at a recycling yard in Belgium, while the master of the vessel is facing trial for the incident that killed one of the crewmembers aboard the containership.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Vanguard Tech Launches Digital CSO Product to Address Insecurity at Sea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/vanguard-tech-launches-digital-cso-product-to-address-insecurity-at-sea,,29/08/2025 02:17:28,,"[By Vanguard Tech] As Red Sea insecurity reshapes global shipping routes, Vanguard Tech has launched a first-of-its-kind 'Digital CSO' to assist CSOs in managing risk, resilience, and response at sea. Triggered by ongoing insecurity in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and a growing need to provide seafarers with more than just traditional routing guidance, Vanguard Tech has unveiled its new 'Digital CSO' product, a first-of-its-kind digital Company Security Officer (CSO) solution designed to assist CSOs and give shipping companies live visibility, faster decision-making, and stronger protection in the world's most volatile waters. The product, developed over the last 18 months, encompasses complete end-to-end maritime risk management; from the initial planning stages, all the way through to safe arrival. With the Vanguard Tech Digital Platform anchoring the service, Digital CSO is designed to Assess, Alert, Advise, Act, and Assure. Digital CSO redefines vessel risk through a fully integrated AI-driven platform. The product is available to clients on a tiered basis – ensuring scalable support for fleets of all sizes – and encompasses elements ranging from maritime intelligence, digital tracking, SSAS alerting, closed-loop tracking, annual ISPS-compliant emergency drills, and access to the new Vanguard AI insurance platform. Although the product is applicable globally, some elements have been individually tailored to particular high-risk areas. For example, amidst ongoing Houthi targeting of vessels, the affiliation assessments can give assurances to all stakeholders – from owners to insurers – that vessels can transit high-risk areas safely. Benjamin Simonson, Vanguards Head of Operations said, ""For years, the CSO's duties were carried out in a traditional way. With Vanguard's Digital CSO, we're not replacing that role but empowering it with advanced technology. It's now about live insights, data-driven accountability, and continuous monitoring. By bringing risk intelligence, tracking, and communication together in one platform, shipping companies can make faster, more accurate decisions. The result is fewer delays, stronger compliance, and greater protection where it matters most. For the first time, Vanguard is delivering end-to-end digital risk management for shipping - fully automated, seamless, and designed to give operators, managers, and owners true peace of mind."" The launch comes at a time of heightened global maritime disruption, with shipping seeking smarter, technology-driven solutions to navigate risks such as piracy, conflict spillover, and sanctions exposure. With security conditions in key maritime chokepoints deteriorating, Vanguard positions Digital CSO as a transformational solution for shipping companies — providing not just compliance, but proactive resilience, operational assurance, and safer seas.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
North Carolina Utility Cites Costs Deferring Offshore Wind Power for Solar,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/north-carolina-utility-cites-costs-deferring-offshore-wind-power-for-solar,,29/08/2025 01:55:25,,"Duke Energy, which is one of the United States’ largest energy companies, has determined that offshore wind energy does not offer a cost advantage over solar power for North Carolina. The determination came as the utility was planning its long-term power sources and is based on proposals from the current leaseholders for offshore wind in North Carolina. Headquartered in North Carolina, the company operates utilities in the Southeast as well as the Midwest. Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy. As part of this review, it was instructed to request estimates from the three leaseholders for the development of up to 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. Duke, through its non-regulated subsidiary Cinergy, holds one of the leases that it was awarded in 2022. The project known as Carolina Long Bay is 22 miles south of Bald Head Island and could support up to approximately 1.6 GW. Neighboring Carolina Long Bay is TotalEnergies, which has the potential for 1.6 GW, and the two companies have explored collaborations. A third offshore site available to Duke is Avangrid’s Kitty Hawk South, which was awarded in 2017. The company originally said it could produce up to 2.4 GW, but in 2022 sold the northern portion of its lease to Dominion Energy. The three developers submitted a total of eight proposals, Duke reports in a filing to the Utilities Commission. It was looking for the projects to be developed by 2035. In the filing submitted on August 11, Duke informed the commission that, based on its review, it determined solar and battery storage was cheaper in every instance. The company reports it was comparing the cost of building 3,576 MW of solar panels and 3,440 MW of battery storage capacity. A spokesperson for the company told North Carolina Public Radio that they determined “offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time.” The commission had instructed Duke that if the proposals were cost-competitive, to proceed with a binding request for proposals. Supporters of wind energy were quick to criticize the review, noting that solar only provides power 30 to 40 percent of the time, whereas wind energy can generate between 80 and 90 percent of the time. They said they were “disappointed” that Duke was not proceeding, highlighting that it would require at least a decade before construction and commercial operations could be realized. “The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the public radio station WUNC. Duke Energy is aggressively pursuing solar energy in Florida. The company reported last month that it currently owns, operates, and maintains a portfolio of more than 25 solar sites across Florida that generate approximately 1.5 GW, and between 2025 and 2027, the company plans to build 12 new solar sites, adding 900 megawatts. By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects it will have over 6.1 GW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online. The company is reviewing its North Carolina plans. In a 2024 plan, it showed up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035. Another model included as much as 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. The planning study was undertaken before the Trump administration’s latest moves against the offshore wind energy sector. In addition to its ending leasing, the administration is now starting a national security review. It has also curtailed tax credits and other incentives for offshore wind energy development.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Report: Chemical Tanker Attacked by Pirates in Gulf of Guinea,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-chemical-tanker-attacked-by-pirates-in-gulf-of-guinea,,29/08/2025 01:12:36,,"[Breaking] A pirate attack has been reported aboard a chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in the Gulf of Guinea, a rare occurrence in what was once a hotspot of maritime hijackings and kidnappings.

Australia Awards More Preliminary Feasibility Licenses for Offshore Wind,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/australia-awards-more-preliminary-feasibility-licenses-for-offshore-wind,,29/08/2025 00:58:16,,"The Australian government reports it is continuing to push forward with efforts to spur development for offshore wind energy. In its latest step, it awarded two additional preliminary feasibility licenses, both going to groups backed by European majors, for what could become the first offshore wind farms in the Indian Ocean. The move comes as some of the major European corporations have stalled their efforts in Australia or withdrawn. Last week, it was revealed that Equinor will not be accepting its feasibility license for a proposed project that would have involved floating wind turbines off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The company reportedly could not reach an agreement with its local partner Oceanex, while last month it also withdrew from a project planned for the Bass Strait. Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, called the new licenses being awarded another important step for the industry in Western Australia. He highlighted that “Western Australia needs some 50 GW of additional generation by 2042.” The zone located south of Perth was declared in September 2024, with the government saying it could provide as much as 11.4 GW of renewable energy. The first of the licenses was awarded to Oceanex Energy, which is planning a project in the northern part of the zone, but awards for the southern portion of the zone were delayed while two developers could resolve an overlap between their plans. One of the new licenses went to a group backed by France’s EFP Group. It is planning the Bunbury Offshore Wind South project. Ocean Winds, a partnership between Spain’s EDP Renewables and France’s ENGIE is also receiving a preliminary license for its Westward Wind project. The preliminary licenses permit the companies to continue planning efforts. They are also required to meet with the indigenous people, which Australia calls “traditional owners.” The companies will later apply for the full feasibility permits. A third project, called Wind With Purpose, is still pursuing discussions with a potential Tier 1 partner, it told ABC News Australia. The government deferred granting it a preliminary feasibility license. Minister Bowen said in a statement, “Australia’s offshore wind industry is progressing, with feasibility licenses granted for projects targeting a total of 24.21 GW of renewable energy and preliminary offers for another 4 GW.” He told ABC News that there is more to come, referencing the ongoing efforts to push forward the offshore wind industry.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
"India Pitches $1 Trillion Maritime ""Roadmap"" to Foreign Envoys",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/india-pitches-1-trillion-maritime-roadmap-to-foreign-envoys,,29/08/2025 00:40:52,,"India's shipping ministry is shooting for the moon with its ambitions for the nation's maritime future. At a meeting for foreign ambassadors ahead of India Maritime Week, Union minister for shipping Sarbananda Sonowal pitched a $1 trillion ""roadmap"" for public and private investment in the nation's critical infrastructure. Speaking to representatives from 28 nations, Sonowal said that India is working to transform and modernize its ports, logistics and shipping systems. ""These opportunities open up a $1 trillion maritime investment roadmap, with strong potential for joint ventures in developing ports and cargo terminal operations, multi-modal terminals, maritime services, shipbuilding, ship recycling and ship repairs, green hydrogen hubs, and sustainable shipping solutions,"" he said. To get ready, India's government has been overhauling the nation's maritime legal structure to bring it up to date and align it with international standards, making the country more accessible for foreign shipping investors. Five newly-passed legislative acts - the Bills of Lading Act, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Merchant Shipping Act, Coastal Shipping Act, and Indian Ports Act - are all part of a plan to update laws that date back to the era of British governance. The investment pitch delved into specifics of opportunities for foreign partners. Port investors could spend on projects like Vadhavan Port, a gigantic transshipment-focused container port in Maharashtra with a proposed nameplate capacity of 23 million TEU at full buildout - enough to double India's entire container-handling capacity. Other opportunities include Galathea Bay Transshipment Port, a large-scale container facility planned in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and Tuna Tekra Terminal, a two million TEU container port on India's west coast, operated by DP World. The government is also looking to attract investors for LNG bunkering hubs, industrial parks and green fuel infrastructure. ""India stands ready to collaborate and lead towards a maritime future that is prosperous, sustainable and inclusive,"" Sonowal said.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Tsuneishi’s China Shipyard Launches Next-Gen Methanol Containership,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/tsuneishi-s-china-shipyard-launches-next-gen-methanol-containership,,28/08/2025 23:59:23,,"The Chinese shipyard in the Tsuneishi Shipbuilding group marked a milestone on August 27 as it floated the first of its next-generation energy-efficient methanol dual-fuel containership. The vessel is also the largest container vessel built by the Tsuneishi Group and part of its efforts to build leadership in methanol-fueled vessels. The newly launched containership will have a capacity of 5,915 TEU. The yard also notes that in response to the growing demand for refrigerated transport in recent years, the vessel can also carry up to 1,400 reefer containers. The name of the vessel and its details were not released by the yard, but the blue livery and funnel markings are distinctive. Maersk is currently completing the introduction of its large, 16,000-plus TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships and in 2023 reported it had also entered a contract with Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group for six 9,000 TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships due doe delivery in late 2026 and to be completed by March 2027. Maersk’s fleet strategy announced in August 2024 called for orders reaching a total of 50 to 60 vessels, equaling 800,000 TEU for delivery between 2026 and 2030. Tsuneishi highlights its new class of vessels incorporates an improved hull form and the group’s proprietary energy-saving technology, MT-FAST, an energy-saving device that improves propulsion efficiency by approximately four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. They also highlight the vessel employing a concept known as a “final solution” towards achieving zero CO2 emissions. It will be capable of using green methanol as its primary fuel. The main engine and also the on-board generators – including the HiMSEN engine (8H32DF-LM) manufactured by HD Hyundai – are capable of operating on methanol fuel. It also adopts a large-capacity shaft generator that enables what Tsuneiship says will be “outstanding fuel efficiency.” It is also designed for shore power. Assembly of the first of the new ships began in April 2025. The vessel launched this week is scheduled for delivery in February 2026. Tsuneishi Shipbuilding says it will continue to advance the practical application of methanol dual-fuelled vessels. In July, the group’s yard in the Philippines launched the world’s first methanol dual-fueled Kamsarmax, and before that, in May, it introduced a methanol dual-fueled Ultramax built at its yard in Japan.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Op-Ed: Shipping Must Evolve to Support Neurodivergent Seafarers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-shipping-must-evolve-to-support-neurodivergent-seafarers,,28/08/2025 23:50:06,,"Whilst the maritime industry continues to adapt to change, one aspect of workforce inclusion is still widely overlooked - neurodiversity. With latest statistics suggesting nearly 20 percent of the global population is neurodivergent, this is not a segment of our society we can simply ignore. The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to the natural differences in how people experience, process, and respond to the world around them. It includes a range of cognitive profiles such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. Autism, for example, is a developmental condition that affects how individuals communicate, interact, and process sensory information. Common traits may include differences in social communication, a preference for routine, sensory sensitivities, and intense focus on specific interests. While these can present challenges in some environments, they also contribute valuable strengths such as attention to detail, reliability, and creative problem-solving. To date, the prevalence among seafarers is unknown. Seafaring is already a demanding profession, with long contracts, unpredictable conditions, isolation from family, and confined living spaces testing the resilience of even the most seasoned professionals. For neurodivergent seafarers, these pressures can be more difficult to manage and often involve additional, less visible challenges. Simultaneously, the idiosyncratic nature of seafaring - with its need for attention to detail, particular social structure, routine onboard, and need for intense focus and problem-solving skills - may appeal to neurodivergent individuals. Despite growing awareness of neurodiversity in other industries, maritime is still in the early stages of recognizing exactly how neurodivergence can affect life at sea. Many operational structures, such as overstimulating environments and training practices, are designed around neurotypical norms. In some cases, cultural attitudes and stigma towards neurodivergence can make matters worse. Misunderstandings or a lack of awareness may lead to unfair assumptions or behavior and, in some cases, even discourage individuals from being open about their needs. This is not just an issue of wellbeing. It also influences safety, retention and long-term career development. Neurodivergent individuals often bring highly valuable skills to maritime roles, such as thinking, problem-solving, pattern recognition, and deep focus. These strengths align with the increasing complexity of maritime operations, particularly in safety and technical environments. However, when understanding and support are lacking, this potential is often overlooked. In April an industry-first initiative by NeurodiversAtSea, the Seafarers Hospital Society and The Seafarers’ Charity was launched. The program is designed to provide tailored support to neurodivergent seafarers and to better understand how maritime environments can evolve to be more inclusive. This is a meaningful step forward, and a strong signal that change is both possible and necessary. That said, progress cannot rest on a few initiatives alone. Industry-wide commitment is essential. There is still a significant gap in data. Without targeted research into the lived experiences of neurodivergent seafarers, it is difficult to develop meaningful support. Strategies must be grounded in evidence rather than assumptions. It is equally important to build disclosure-safe environments. Many seafarers may avoid disclosing neurodivergence due to fear of judgment, limited understanding or the risk of being at a professional disadvantage. Creating a culture of safety and acceptance is essential. People must feel as though they are able to express their needs without any concern for negative consequences or reactions. Training must also improve. Neurodiversity awareness should be included in programs at every level, from cadets to senior leadership. This involves understanding communication differences and adapting daily practices to support all aspects of neurodiversity. Too often, we hear from people who speak confidently about issues they have never personally faced. While intentions may be sincere, policies or initiatives shaped without direct input from those affected often overlook the reality of daily experience. As younger generations enter the workforce, this conversation becomes even more urgent. Many young professionals are more likely to identify as neurodivergent or expect employers to support cognitive diversity. Inclusion is no longer optional. It is a key factor in attracting and retaining future talent. At OneCare Group, we support maritime organizations in making this a reality. Through our Neurodiversity and ADHD Awareness Initiative, we provide the resources and guidance necessary to help ensure that neurodivergent seafarers are not simply accommodated but supported to thrive in every role, both at sea and ashore. By shifting from policy to practice, and from awareness to advocacy, we can drive a more inclusive maritime culture, one where diversity fuels safety, innovation, and human performance.

Report: Lürssen’s Naval Shipbuilder Target for German Defense Consolidation,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/report-luerssen-s-naval-shipbuilder-target-for-german-defense-consolidation,,28/08/2025 22:53:21,,"Media reports in Germany are highlighting the potential for the sale of the shipbuilder NVL (Naval Vessels Lürssen) to defense industry major Rheinmetall as part of the further consolidation in the defense sector. The German government is reported to be encouraging the industry to explore steps to enhance its capabilities to meet the country’s urgent needs. Rheinmetall, a manufacturer of tanks and ammunition, has in the past expressed interest in entering the naval shipbuilding sector. The company is now reported to be in discussions with NVL to acquire the operation, which is one of Germany’s leading naval shipbuilders. The supervisory board of Rheinmetall is reported to be set to discuss the acquisition, writes the German newspaper Bild. The news outlet NDR followed up on the reports by speaking with the company’s CEO during an event on Wednesday, August 27. NDR reports he responded by saying, “We are always interested in expanding our product portfolio...We will only talk about it once decisions have been made.” The German government has been encouraging the industry to explore opportunities while saying it needs to increase the country’s defense capabilities and to do so quickly. NVL is a current partner in the new frigate program with Damen that has become mired in problems with its electronics. Germany’s defense ministry has said it will look to rapidly grow its naval operations based on the increased dangers in the Baltic and North Sea. The German Press Agency (dpa) reports Lürssen sent a letter to its workforce saying, in response to the needs of the government, it has “decided to intensify consolidation talks.” Bild reports that the family that controls Lürssen is looking to focus on the company’s yacht shipbuilding operation. The group separated in 2021, putting Lürssen’s yacht and naval businesses into independent units. Lürssen also recently completed the sale in June of its naval shipbuilding operation in Australia to the local company Civmec. NVL is the product of consolidation in the naval shipbuilding sector. Lürssen and German Naval Yards Keil agreed in 2020 to consolidate their operations. NVL’s operations now consist of four leading yards, including Peene-Werft in Wolgast and Blohm+Voss in Hamburg. Norderwerft in Hamburg and Neue Jadewerft in Wilhelmshaven are dedicated to repairs, refits, and modernisations of naval vessels and auxiliary ships. The products include a specialization in corvettes and patrol boats as well as frigates, minesweepers, and coast guard vessels, both domestically and internationally. TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems) and German Naval Yards are the other two large competitors in the sector. Media reports suggest that Rheinmetall was one of the potential suitors that also looked at TKMS as Thyssenkrupp was considering alternatives for the company before settling on the plan to spin off the naval shipbuilder later this year to shareholders.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
"Study: Maritime Industry is Trying Out AI, But is Still Skeptical",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/study-maritime-industry-is-trying-out-ai-but-is-still-skeptical,,28/08/2025 21:58:59,,"Maritime companies are enthusiastic about AI's potential for streamlining business and operational tasks, but are struggling to move beyond small-scale experiments, according to a new industry study by Marcura and Thetius. The study found that 82 percent of maritime professionals are optimistic about AI's role in their sector, but nearly two-thirds worry that over-reliance on the technology could erode critical human skills and judgment. The overwhelming majority believe that AI tools still need human oversight to make sure that they perform as needed - and it's clear that AI will need human input for data collection, data labeling and prompts, in addition to human evaluation of the outputs. The study, which surveyed more than 130 maritime professionals and conducted in-depth interviews, paints a picture of an industry caught between promise and reality. Though 81 percent of companies are running AI pilot projects, only 11 percent have established formal policies to guide how these technologies should be scaled across their operations. The research identified clear consensus on AI's most promising applications. Nearly all respondents — 97 percent — see benefits in reducing manual workflow inefficiencies, while 87 percent believe AI can improve charter party contract analysis and help spot potential pitfalls. However, more than two-thirds of respondents — 69 percent — expressed concerns that AI solutions might miss critical warning signs in contracts or voyage planning, potentially leading to costly business mistakes. 37 percent said they had personally witnessed AI failures in their organizations, and nearly a quarter of respondents said that AI vendors' claims often fail to match real-world results, The specialized nature of maritime operations are a key factor in these implementation challenges. As anyone in maritime who has tried to use ChatGPT knows, generic AI tools often struggle with the sector's idiosyncratic terms and acronyms, its unique rules and its operational realities - all of which are a foreign language and culture that outsiders have to learn, including software outsiders. ""A general AI agent might interpret 'SF' as 'standard form,' but in shipping, it means 'stowage factor,'"" explained Janani Yagnamurthy, vice president of analytics at Marcura. ""Off-the-shelf solutions might automate basic processes, but they miss the nuanced context that maritime professionals rely on."" The skepticism about AI was highest for legal and compliance tasks; though the legal profession as a whole has adopted widespread use of AI for basic tasks, shipping respondents rated their compliance departments as least-suited for AI usage at present, citing concerns about data governance, regulatory liability and misinterpretation of legal nuances by AI. Maritime-specific, purpose built AI agents may perform better than generic tools for these tasks. Marcura says that its AI-powered contract analysis tools recently helped a dry bulk operator avoid more than $120,000 in potential losses by identifying missing clauses in the draft of an agreement. Despite successes in specific applications, most companies are still just testing the waters, and only 17 percent have established transparent processes for how AI systems inform decisionmaking in their companies. ""When change happens, it's very natural to fear losing control,"" Yagnamurthy said. ""Skilled maritime professionals have spent decades honing their judgment in high-stakes roles. The best AI functions like a co-pilot, not a replacement."" Familiarity and fluency with AI will also need improvement: 38 percent reported that inadequate training is the biggest barrier to scaling up the use of the technology in their business. Poor implementation and poor education of the users can lead to poor outcomes, multiple respondents said. ""People train their AI models but they don’t train their people. If the crew and the office do not understand the AI outputs, it could lead to misuse, which creates mistrust. We need to first train our people and our minds,"" one shipmanager told the research team.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
NTSB: Delayed Emergency Response Contributed to Collision and $1M in Damage,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-delayed-emergency-response-contributed-to-collision-and-1m-in-damage,,28/08/2025 20:30:27,,"The National Transportation Safety Board is out with a new warning for crews about testing and training to respond to a loss of steering control due to a malfunction. It concluded in an investigation into a 2023 collision in the Houston Ship Channel that the failure of a small rubber sheath and a delayed response by the crew to implement emergency steering procedures contributed to the collision after a component failed in the primary steering system. The multi-purpose carrier BBC Africa (7,530 dwt) was departing Houston, Texas, on August 25, 2023, when the vessel suddenly lost steering control and veered off course, striking the docked bulker Common Faith (57,000 dwt), which was at the Anderson Grain Terminal in Houston. The post ballast tank of the bulker was punctured, along with damage to the shell plating, which cost a total of $467,000 to repair. The BBC Africa suffered damage to its bulbous bow, hull, and shell plating and forward bulwarks, costing $700,000 to repair. There were no injuries or pollution reported from the incident. NTSB reconstructed the events using AIS data and crew interviews. The BBC Africa’s Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) was not functioning, but the vessel had permission to sail while repairs were being arranged. On the morning of August 25, pre-departure testing of the system on the BBC Africa showed no problems. The second officer tested the steering gear, checked rudder movements, and ran the steering gear pumps, while engineers also completed a pre-departure checklist. The master also tested steering from the port bridge wing and told the pilot aboard that everything was “in good working order.” About 10 minutes after having gotten underway, the ship was making speeds up to 6.8 knots, and everything was going smoothly. The pilot released the escort tug, and the pilot and master ordered that maneuvering control (bow thruster, main propulsion engine control, and steering) be transferred from the port bridge wing to the main control station on the bridge. The chief officer pressed the button to activate the controls on the bridge. The pilot then gave a command for starboard 10, and the helmsman confirmed adjusting the rudder. Sensing the vessel was not turning at the expected rate, the pilot ordered starboard 20 and then hard to starboard. It was then that the chief officer realized the indicator light on the main control station had gone off and tried pressing it several times to reengage the controls. The rudder indicator was showing a hard port position of 30 degrees. The master then switched the vessel’s steering to emergency override mode and got the rudder back to 30 degrees starboard. The pilot also ordered full astern, and the master then put the bow thruster to 100 percent starboard thrust. However, it was too late, and they hit the docked bulker. Investigators were unable to replicate the failure, but working with the system manufacturer determined that a component failure had caused the system to fail. The company’s investigation found the rubber on the joystick (tiller) had invisible cracks that let moisture into the control unit, which contributed to the loss of the electrical signal. The shipping company, on advice from the manufacturer, changed the bridge wing steering control tillers, the “in command” push buttons, and the main power supply transformer. They made the same changes on two other vessels with similar control systems. The report says that the primary cause was the equipment failure. However, they also noted a stressful situation with short reaction time due to the vessel being in the confines of the port. The NTSB notes the crew had gone through training and regular drills, but recommended further training, saying that the delayed response from the ship’s crew to implement the emergency steering procedure from the bridge contributed to the vessel striking the docked bulker. The steering gear manufacturer also issued a safety bulletin. It highlighted incidents with systems manufactured between 2002 and 2009, noting that they had malfunctioned due to a weakness with the protective rubber and the micro switches. The bulletin said the consequence of the failing micro switches could lead to unintended rudder movement.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25
Video: Ukraine Damages Russian Missile Boat in the Sea of Azov,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/video-ukraine-damages-russian-missile-boat-in-the-sea-of-azov,,28/08/2025 18:22:36,,"Ukraine military intelligence has released a video showing one of its one-way attack aerial drones attacking a Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette in the Sea of Azov. The corvette was hit and damaged on August 28, but it is not yet clear if the vessel has been able to recover to port. Defence Intelligence of Ukraine strikes russian ""buyan-m"" corvette — a carrier of ""kalibr"" cruise missiles — in the Azov Sea : https://t.co/Q1lOahxlqy pic.twitter.com/SMPEc1b3Z6 The attack is noteworthy because of the location of the attack. The Sea of Azov is effectively a Russian lake, Ukraine having lost its control of coastline in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia in 2022. Hence Ukraine will have had to fly the attack drone either through Russian land-based air defenses in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia, or taken a longer route over the sea and around Crimea. The drone’s pilots will then need to have locked onto the target at this long range. Location of the corvette when struck in the Sea of Azov (45°42′N 35°18′E ) (Google Earth, Landsat Copernicus, CJRC) Ukraine has demonstrated it can do this against static targets at extreme range. However, to be able to do so against a moving target at long range is technically a considerable accomplishment. This should once again cause Russian naval commanders to consider the security of their naval assets even in ports far distant from Crimea such as Novorossiysk, to where vessels have already been pulled back for safety. The attack may have been mounted by Ukraine to demonstrate that it can control sea approaches to the Sea of Azov ports of Mariupol and Berdyansk, which Russia has recently sought to open to foreign shipping. Buyan-M Class Project 21631 missile corvette (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation) Buyan-M Class corvettes are primarily designed for littoral coastal defense, and are the mainstay of both what remains of the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian Flotilla. They are however armed with two vertical launch cells, each able to hold four Kalibr missiles. The Kalibr is designed to be an anti-ship weapon, but has frequently been used to hit ground targets in Ukraine. In its land-attack version, the Kalibr has a range of 1,500 miles, and can therefore hit targets anywhere in Ukraine form the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 04:39:25

"UK, France and Germany Trigger UN ""Snapback"" Sanctions on Iran",https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-france-and-germany-trigger-un-snapback-sanctions-on-iran,,29/08/2025 06:00:05,,"The UK, Germany and France have followed in the footsteps of U.S. regulators and have reimposed ""snapback"" sanctions on Iran over its nuclear weapons program. The decision amounts to an end of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the 2015 multilateral agreement that is known in the U.S. as the ""Iran nuclear deal."" The UN Security Council unanimously approved the JCPOA, and international monitors found that for the next three years, Iran appeared to keep to the letter of the deal on uranium enrichment and nuclear R&D. However, its other military activities continued unabated, creating an ongoing and urgent concern for Iran's critics and neighbors. Though not nuclear per se, these activities - specifically Iran's accumulating missile stockpile, its involvement in civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and its provision of training and support for anti-American militias - had serious strategic implications. In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions on Iran, initiating a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran's economically-vital petroleum sector. One year later, Iran began breaching the terms of the agreement on enriched uranium and centrifuges, and it restricted international monitors' access to its nuclear sites. The UK, France and Germany tried to mediate, but did not immediately exit the deal. ""We acted in good faith to preserve the JCPoA, in the sincere hope of finding a way to resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue, while preserving the agreement and remaining within its framework,"" the three European nations (together, the E3) said in a joint statement. In July 2025, in a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, the E3 proposed to extend its terms if Iran would meet several criteria, beginning with inspections and resumption of negotiations. Iran did not agree, and the E3 concluded that ""Iran's non-compliance with the JCPoA is clear and deliberate."" The E3 have decided to notify the UN Security Council that Iran is not following its commitments under the deal, activating the ""snapback"" mechanism that reimposes UN sanctions. ""If the UNSC does not adopt within 30 days a resolution to continue the lifting of UNSC resolutions on Iran, six Security Council resolutions, including on sanctions, will be restored,"" the E3 noted. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the announcement and said that it was a prelude to renewed negotiations. In a statement, Rubio said that ""snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it."" The UN sanctions that are set to enter into renewed effect will reimpose an arms embargo, an overseas asset freeze, a travel ban, limits on ballistic missile programs, and restrictions on nuclear technology. These limits could reinforce the economic effects of the U.S. government's unilateral ""maximum pressure"" sanctions regime. Iran's currency, the rial, fell abruptly after the E3's announcement, reflecting market expectations of additional economic pressure. In a statement Thursday, the Iranian government called the E3's actions a ""provocative and unnecessary escalation,"" and pledged to respond. ""Iran has acted responsibly and in good faith in adhering to diplomacy for resolving nuclear-related issues,"" asserted Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a statement. The current status of its nuclear program is opaque, as UN experts have been banned from its sites, and Iran denies that it has intentions of producing a nuclear bomb. But as of May - before a series of Israeli and American airstrikes - it was believed to possess enough high-enriched uranium to produce nine nuclear weapons. To achieve a nuclear breakout, Iran would still need to develop a working weapon design, and would have to process its uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal for fabrication.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Nord Stream Suspect Also Under Investigation for Tanker Attack in Italy,https://maritime-executive.com/article/nord-stream-suspect-also-under-investigation-for-tanker-attack-in-italy,,29/08/2025 04:14:25,,"The Ukrainian military veteran arrested last week in connection with the Nord Stream pipeline attack is also under investigation for involvement in the blast that hit the tanker Seajewel, according to Italian media reports. Serhii Kuzientsov, an ex-Ukrainian special forces soldier, was detained in the Italian resort town of Rimini last week by the Carabinieri. He has an outstanding warrant in Germany for involvement in the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream pipeline system, which badly damaged three out of the four Russian gas lines under the Baltic. According to Corriere della Sera, Kuzientsov had driven to Rimini in a car with Ukrainian plates, accompanied by his family, and had registered for lodging under his own name - hardly attempting to evade detection. Kuzientsov faces extradition to Germany to stand trial for charges related to the Nord Stream attack, and he is fighting that process in court. At a hearing on Monday, he told the Bologna Court of Appeal that he was in Ukraine at the time of the Nord Stream attack, and denied any knowledge of it. He is in detention while the legal process moves forward, according to Corriere de Bologna - but there is a possibility that he could also be charged in Italy for a separate incident. Prosecutors in Genoa have been conducting a terrorism investigation in connection with the attack on a crude oil tanker at Savona in February, and have previously told local media that they suspect a Ukrainian nexus. The vessel, Seajewel, is one of seven tankers that were hit by mysterious explosions in the first half of the year. All previously carried Russian cargoes, prompting speculation over possible Ukrainian involvement; Ukraine has invested significant resources in attacking the Russian energy industry, which is the financial foundation of the ongoing invasion. The Genoa investigation is looking into Kuzientsov's potential involvement in the attack on the Seajewel, according to Corriere della Sera. That inquiry is ongoing, and could lead to additional charges of wrecking a vessel with an aggravating factor of terrorist intent. Other arrests could be coming: German authorities have identified five more suspected accomplices in connection with the Nord Stream attacks, and have filed at least one other outstanding warrant.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Crowley Replaces Fire-Damaged Tanker to Support US Tanker Security Program,https://maritime-executive.com/article/crowley-replaces-fire-damaged-tanker-to-support-us-tanker-security-program,,29/08/2025 02:21:19,,"Nearly six months after the tragic incident in which one of the tankers Crowley manages for the US’s Tanker Security Program was damaged after it was hit by a containership, the shipping manager reports it has received US permission for a replacement. The program administered by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) is critical as it transports fuel supplies for the U.S. Department of Defense. Crowley Stena Marine Solutions, the joint venture between Crowley and Stena Bulk, reports that MARAD recently approved operating the MR tanker CS Anthem under the Tanker Security Program. The companies note that the vessel will advance the nation’s strategic sealift capabilities. ""The addition of the CS Anthem demonstrates our commitment to strengthening U.S. maritime security and providing reliable, U.S.-crewed tanker capacity in support of national defense,"" said Tucker Gilliam, vice president of fleet operations for Crowley Shipping. ""Together with Stena Bulk, we are proud to continue advancing solutions that serve both commercial and government energy transportation needs."" The new vessel is largely a swap with the same characteristics as the damaged ship. Built in 2017, CS Anthem had been operating for India’s Scorpio. It is 49,990 dwt compared with 49,729 dwt for the Stena Immaculate, which was also built in 2017, and which it replaces. The databases show CS Antheim was recently transferred to the U.S. flag from the Marshall Islands and now has a homeport of Jacksonville, Florida. Crowley is responsible for crewing and managing the tanker under a bareboat charter through the joint venture. The company also manages the tankers Stena Imperative and Stena Impeccable in the Tanker Security Program. Stena Immaculate was anchored off the east coast of England after transporting a cargo of jet fuel. It was waiting for its berth when the containership Solong hit the tanker at anchor. The resulting fire engulfed both vessels, but Crowley’s crew acted heroically, starting fire suppression systems before they were safely evacuated. The tanker survived with portions of its cargo intact. They arranged for another tanker to receive the fuel, and the damaged vessel was towed to Great Yarmouth in the UK, where it appears to still be berthed. The Solong recently arrived at a recycling yard in Belgium, while the master of the vessel is facing trial for the incident that killed one of the crewmembers aboard the containership.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Vanguard Tech Launches Digital CSO Product to Address Insecurity at Sea,https://maritime-executive.com/article/vanguard-tech-launches-digital-cso-product-to-address-insecurity-at-sea,,29/08/2025 02:17:28,,"[By Vanguard Tech] As Red Sea insecurity reshapes global shipping routes, Vanguard Tech has launched a first-of-its-kind 'Digital CSO' to assist CSOs in managing risk, resilience, and response at sea. Triggered by ongoing insecurity in the Southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and a growing need to provide seafarers with more than just traditional routing guidance, Vanguard Tech has unveiled its new 'Digital CSO' product, a first-of-its-kind digital Company Security Officer (CSO) solution designed to assist CSOs and give shipping companies live visibility, faster decision-making, and stronger protection in the world's most volatile waters. The product, developed over the last 18 months, encompasses complete end-to-end maritime risk management; from the initial planning stages, all the way through to safe arrival. With the Vanguard Tech Digital Platform anchoring the service, Digital CSO is designed to Assess, Alert, Advise, Act, and Assure. Digital CSO redefines vessel risk through a fully integrated AI-driven platform. The product is available to clients on a tiered basis – ensuring scalable support for fleets of all sizes – and encompasses elements ranging from maritime intelligence, digital tracking, SSAS alerting, closed-loop tracking, annual ISPS-compliant emergency drills, and access to the new Vanguard AI insurance platform. Although the product is applicable globally, some elements have been individually tailored to particular high-risk areas. For example, amidst ongoing Houthi targeting of vessels, the affiliation assessments can give assurances to all stakeholders – from owners to insurers – that vessels can transit high-risk areas safely. Benjamin Simonson, Vanguards Head of Operations said, ""For years, the CSO's duties were carried out in a traditional way. With Vanguard's Digital CSO, we're not replacing that role but empowering it with advanced technology. It's now about live insights, data-driven accountability, and continuous monitoring. By bringing risk intelligence, tracking, and communication together in one platform, shipping companies can make faster, more accurate decisions. The result is fewer delays, stronger compliance, and greater protection where it matters most. For the first time, Vanguard is delivering end-to-end digital risk management for shipping - fully automated, seamless, and designed to give operators, managers, and owners true peace of mind."" The launch comes at a time of heightened global maritime disruption, with shipping seeking smarter, technology-driven solutions to navigate risks such as piracy, conflict spillover, and sanctions exposure. With security conditions in key maritime chokepoints deteriorating, Vanguard positions Digital CSO as a transformational solution for shipping companies — providing not just compliance, but proactive resilience, operational assurance, and safer seas.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
North Carolina Utility Cites Costs Deferring Offshore Wind Power for Solar,https://maritime-executive.com/article/north-carolina-utility-cites-costs-deferring-offshore-wind-power-for-solar,,29/08/2025 01:55:25,,"Duke Energy, which is one of the United States’ largest energy companies, has determined that offshore wind energy does not offer a cost advantage over solar power for North Carolina. The determination came as the utility was planning its long-term power sources and is based on proposals from the current leaseholders for offshore wind in North Carolina. Headquartered in North Carolina, the company operates utilities in the Southeast as well as the Midwest. Its North Carolina utility was directed by the state's Utilities Commission last fall to explore offshore wind energy. As part of this review, it was instructed to request estimates from the three leaseholders for the development of up to 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. Duke, through its non-regulated subsidiary Cinergy, holds one of the leases that it was awarded in 2022. The project known as Carolina Long Bay is 22 miles south of Bald Head Island and could support up to approximately 1.6 GW. Neighboring Carolina Long Bay is TotalEnergies, which has the potential for 1.6 GW, and the two companies have explored collaborations. A third offshore site available to Duke is Avangrid’s Kitty Hawk South, which was awarded in 2017. The company originally said it could produce up to 2.4 GW, but in 2022 sold the northern portion of its lease to Dominion Energy. The three developers submitted a total of eight proposals, Duke reports in a filing to the Utilities Commission. It was looking for the projects to be developed by 2035. In the filing submitted on August 11, Duke informed the commission that, based on its review, it determined solar and battery storage was cheaper in every instance. The company reports it was comparing the cost of building 3,576 MW of solar panels and 3,440 MW of battery storage capacity. A spokesperson for the company told North Carolina Public Radio that they determined “offshore wind is not cost-competitive at this time.” The commission had instructed Duke that if the proposals were cost-competitive, to proceed with a binding request for proposals. Supporters of wind energy were quick to criticize the review, noting that solar only provides power 30 to 40 percent of the time, whereas wind energy can generate between 80 and 90 percent of the time. They said they were “disappointed” that Duke was not proceeding, highlighting that it would require at least a decade before construction and commercial operations could be realized. “The cost of wind being compared to solar and storage is one thing, but the efficiency of offshore wind being compared to solar and storage is a completely different thing because there are just fundamentally so many key differences between the technologies,"" Karly Brownfield, a senior program manager with the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the public radio station WUNC. Duke Energy is aggressively pursuing solar energy in Florida. The company reported last month that it currently owns, operates, and maintains a portfolio of more than 25 solar sites across Florida that generate approximately 1.5 GW, and between 2025 and 2027, the company plans to build 12 new solar sites, adding 900 megawatts. By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects it will have over 6.1 GW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online. The company is reviewing its North Carolina plans. In a 2024 plan, it showed up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind energy by 2035. Another model included as much as 2.4 GW of offshore wind energy. The planning study was undertaken before the Trump administration’s latest moves against the offshore wind energy sector. In addition to its ending leasing, the administration is now starting a national security review. It has also curtailed tax credits and other incentives for offshore wind energy development.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel has been attacked about 56 nautical miles south of Lome. The ship in question is ""highly likely"" to be the chemical tanker Endo Ponente, the firm reported. AIS data provided by Pole Star shows that Endo Ponente got under way from an anchorage off Lome on the morning of August 28 and headed due south, making 6-7 knots. At about 1830, she made a round turn to starboard and her speed dropped to less than a knot. Her last AIS transmission was received half an hour later. Endo Ponente is a 2010-built chemical tanker flagged in Malta. The operator has been contacted for comment.

Australia Awards More Preliminary Feasibility Licenses for Offshore Wind,https://maritime-executive.com/article/australia-awards-more-preliminary-feasibility-licenses-for-offshore-wind,,29/08/2025 00:58:16,,"The Australian government reports it is continuing to push forward with efforts to spur development for offshore wind energy. In its latest step, it awarded two additional preliminary feasibility licenses, both going to groups backed by European majors, for what could become the first offshore wind farms in the Indian Ocean. The move comes as some of the major European corporations have stalled their efforts in Australia or withdrawn. Last week, it was revealed that Equinor will not be accepting its feasibility license for a proposed project that would have involved floating wind turbines off the Hunter coast of New South Wales. The company reportedly could not reach an agreement with its local partner Oceanex, while last month it also withdrew from a project planned for the Bass Strait. Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, called the new licenses being awarded another important step for the industry in Western Australia. He highlighted that “Western Australia needs some 50 GW of additional generation by 2042.” The zone located south of Perth was declared in September 2024, with the government saying it could provide as much as 11.4 GW of renewable energy. The first of the licenses was awarded to Oceanex Energy, which is planning a project in the northern part of the zone, but awards for the southern portion of the zone were delayed while two developers could resolve an overlap between their plans. One of the new licenses went to a group backed by France’s EFP Group. It is planning the Bunbury Offshore Wind South project. Ocean Winds, a partnership between Spain’s EDP Renewables and France’s ENGIE is also receiving a preliminary license for its Westward Wind project. The preliminary licenses permit the companies to continue planning efforts. They are also required to meet with the indigenous people, which Australia calls “traditional owners.” The companies will later apply for the full feasibility permits. A third project, called Wind With Purpose, is still pursuing discussions with a potential Tier 1 partner, it told ABC News Australia. The government deferred granting it a preliminary feasibility license. Minister Bowen said in a statement, “Australia’s offshore wind industry is progressing, with feasibility licenses granted for projects targeting a total of 24.21 GW of renewable energy and preliminary offers for another 4 GW.” He told ABC News that there is more to come, referencing the ongoing efforts to push forward the offshore wind industry.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

At a meeting for foreign ambassadors ahead of India Maritime Week, Union minister for shipping Sarbananda Sonowal pitched a $1 trillion ""roadmap"" for public and private investment in the nation's critical infrastructure. Speaking to representatives from 28 nations, Sonowal said that India is working to transform and modernize its ports, logistics and shipping systems. ""These opportunities open up a $1 trillion maritime investment roadmap, with strong potential for joint ventures in developing ports and cargo terminal operations, multi-modal terminals, maritime services, shipbuilding, ship recycling and ship repairs, green hydrogen hubs, and sustainable shipping solutions,"" he said. To get ready, India's government has been overhauling the nation's maritime legal structure to bring it up to date and align it with international standards, making the country more accessible for foreign shipping investors. Five newly-passed legislative acts - the Bills of Lading Act, Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Merchant Shipping Act, Coastal Shipping Act, and Indian Ports Act - are all part of a plan to update laws that date back to the era of British governance. The investment pitch delved into specifics of opportunities for foreign partners. Port investors could spend on projects like Vadhavan Port, a gigantic transshipment-focused container port in Maharashtra with a proposed nameplate capacity of 23 million TEU at full buildout - enough to double India's entire container-handling capacity. Other opportunities include Galathea Bay Transshipment Port, a large-scale container facility planned in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and Tuna Tekra Terminal, a two million TEU container port on India's west coast, operated by DP World. The government is also looking to attract investors for LNG bunkering hubs, industrial parks and green fuel infrastructure.

Tsuneishi’s China Shipyard Launches Next-Gen Methanol Containership,https://maritime-executive.com/article/tsuneishi-s-china-shipyard-launches-next-gen-methanol-containership,,28/08/2025 23:59:23,,"The Chinese shipyard in the Tsuneishi Shipbuilding group marked a milestone on August 27 as it floated the first of its next-generation energy-efficient methanol dual-fuel containership. The vessel is also the largest container vessel built by the Tsuneishi Group and part of its efforts to build leadership in methanol-fueled vessels. The newly launched containership will have a capacity of 5,915 TEU. The yard also notes that in response to the growing demand for refrigerated transport in recent years, the vessel can also carry up to 1,400 reefer containers. The name of the vessel and its details were not released by the yard, but the blue livery and funnel markings are distinctive. Maersk is currently completing the introduction of its large, 16,000-plus TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships and in 2023 reported it had also entered a contract with Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group for six 9,000 TEU dual-fuel methanol containerships due doe delivery in late 2026 and to be completed by March 2027. Maersk’s fleet strategy announced in August 2024 called for orders reaching a total of 50 to 60 vessels, equaling 800,000 TEU for delivery between 2026 and 2030. Tsuneishi highlights its new class of vessels incorporates an improved hull form and the group’s proprietary energy-saving technology, MT-FAST, an energy-saving device that improves propulsion efficiency by approximately four percent by regulating water flow through the installation of multiple fins in front of the propeller. They also highlight the vessel employing a concept known as a “final solution” towards achieving zero CO2 emissions. It will be capable of using green methanol as its primary fuel. The main engine and also the on-board generators – including the HiMSEN engine (8H32DF-LM) manufactured by HD Hyundai – are capable of operating on methanol fuel. It also adopts a large-capacity shaft generator that enables what Tsuneiship says will be “outstanding fuel efficiency.” It is also designed for shore power. Assembly of the first of the new ships began in April 2025. The vessel launched this week is scheduled for delivery in February 2026. Tsuneishi Shipbuilding says it will continue to advance the practical application of methanol dual-fuelled vessels. In July, the group’s yard in the Philippines launched the world’s first methanol dual-fueled Kamsarmax, and before that, in May, it introduced a methanol dual-fueled Ultramax built at its yard in Japan.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Op-Ed: Shipping Must Evolve to Support Neurodivergent Seafarers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/op-ed-shipping-must-evolve-to-support-neurodivergent-seafarers,,28/08/2025 23:50:06,,"Whilst the maritime industry continues to adapt to change, one aspect of workforce inclusion is still widely overlooked - neurodiversity. With latest statistics suggesting nearly 20 percent of the global population is neurodivergent, this is not a segment of our society we can simply ignore. The term ‘neurodiversity’ refers to the natural differences in how people experience, process, and respond to the world around them. It includes a range of cognitive profiles such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. Autism, for example, is a developmental condition that affects how individuals communicate, interact, and process sensory information. Common traits may include differences in social communication, a preference for routine, sensory sensitivities, and intense focus on specific interests. While these can present challenges in some environments, they also contribute valuable strengths such as attention to detail, reliability, and creative problem-solving. To date, the prevalence among seafarers is unknown. Seafaring is already a demanding profession, with long contracts, unpredictable conditions, isolation from family, and confined living spaces testing the resilience of even the most seasoned professionals. For neurodivergent seafarers, these pressures can be more difficult to manage and often involve additional, less visible challenges. Simultaneously, the idiosyncratic nature of seafaring - with its need for attention to detail, particular social structure, routine onboard, and need for intense focus and problem-solving skills - may appeal to neurodivergent individuals. Despite growing awareness of neurodiversity in other industries, maritime is still in the early stages of recognizing exactly how neurodivergence can affect life at sea. Many operational structures, such as overstimulating environments and training practices, are designed around neurotypical norms. In some cases, cultural attitudes and stigma towards neurodivergence can make matters worse. Misunderstandings or a lack of awareness may lead to unfair assumptions or behavior and, in some cases, even discourage individuals from being open about their needs. This is not just an issue of wellbeing. It also influences safety, retention and long-term career development. Neurodivergent individuals often bring highly valuable skills to maritime roles, such as thinking, problem-solving, pattern recognition, and deep focus. These strengths align with the increasing complexity of maritime operations, particularly in safety and technical environments. However, when understanding and support are lacking, this potential is often overlooked. In April an industry-first initiative by NeurodiversAtSea, the Seafarers Hospital Society and The Seafarers’ Charity was launched. The program is designed to provide tailored support to neurodivergent seafarers and to better understand how maritime environments can evolve to be more inclusive. This is a meaningful step forward, and a strong signal that change is both possible and necessary. That said, progress cannot rest on a few initiatives alone. Industry-wide commitment is essential. There is still a significant gap in data. Without targeted research into the lived experiences of neurodivergent seafarers, it is difficult to develop meaningful support. Strategies must be grounded in evidence rather than assumptions. It is equally important to build disclosure-safe environments. Many seafarers may avoid disclosing neurodivergence due to fear of judgment, limited understanding or the risk of being at a professional disadvantage. Creating a culture of safety and acceptance is essential. People must feel as though they are able to express their needs without any concern for negative consequences or reactions. Training must also improve. Neurodiversity awareness should be included in programs at every level, from cadets to senior leadership. This involves understanding communication differences and adapting daily practices to support all aspects of neurodiversity. Too often, we hear from people who speak confidently about issues they have never personally faced. While intentions may be sincere, policies or initiatives shaped without direct input from those affected often overlook the reality of daily experience. As younger generations enter the workforce, this conversation becomes even more urgent. Many young professionals are more likely to identify as neurodivergent or expect employers to support cognitive diversity. Inclusion is no longer optional. It is a key factor in attracting and retaining future talent. At OneCare Group, we support maritime organizations in making this a reality. Through our Neurodiversity and ADHD Awareness Initiative, we provide the resources and guidance necessary to help ensure that neurodivergent seafarers are not simply accommodated but supported to thrive in every role, both at sea and ashore. By shifting from policy to practice, and from awareness to advocacy, we can drive a more inclusive maritime culture, one where diversity fuels safety, innovation, and human performance. Marinos Kokkinis is Managing Director at OneCare Group.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
Report: Lürssen’s Naval Shipbuilder Target for German Defense Consolidation,https://maritime-executive.com/article/report-luerssen-s-naval-shipbuilder-target-for-german-defense-consolidation,,28/08/2025 22:53:21,,"Media reports in Germany are highlighting the potential for the sale of the shipbuilder NVL (Naval Vessels Lürssen) to defense industry major Rheinmetall as part of the further consolidation in the defense sector. The German government is reported to be encouraging the industry to explore steps to enhance its capabilities to meet the country’s urgent needs. Rheinmetall, a manufacturer of tanks and ammunition, has in the past expressed interest in entering the naval shipbuilding sector. The company is now reported to be in discussions with NVL to acquire the operation, which is one of Germany’s leading naval shipbuilders. The supervisory board of Rheinmetall is reported to be set to discuss the acquisition, writes the German newspaper Bild. The news outlet NDR followed up on the reports by speaking with the company’s CEO during an event on Wednesday, August 27. NDR reports he responded by saying, “We are always interested in expanding our product portfolio...We will only talk about it once decisions have been made.” The German government has been encouraging the industry to explore opportunities while saying it needs to increase the country’s defense capabilities and to do so quickly. NVL is a current partner in the new frigate program with Damen that has become mired in problems with its electronics. Germany’s defense ministry has said it will look to rapidly grow its naval operations based on the increased dangers in the Baltic and North Sea. The German Press Agency (dpa) reports Lürssen sent a letter to its workforce saying, in response to the needs of the government, it has “decided to intensify consolidation talks.” Bild reports that the family that controls Lürssen is looking to focus on the company’s yacht shipbuilding operation. The group separated in 2021, putting Lürssen’s yacht and naval businesses into independent units. Lürssen also recently completed the sale in June of its naval shipbuilding operation in Australia to the local company Civmec. NVL is the product of consolidation in the naval shipbuilding sector. Lürssen and German Naval Yards Keil agreed in 2020 to consolidate their operations. NVL’s operations now consist of four leading yards, including Peene-Werft in Wolgast and Blohm+Voss in Hamburg. Norderwerft in Hamburg and Neue Jadewerft in Wilhelmshaven are dedicated to repairs, refits, and modernisations of naval vessels and auxiliary ships. The products include a specialization in corvettes and patrol boats as well as frigates, minesweepers, and coast guard vessels, both domestically and internationally. TKMS (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems) and German Naval Yards are the other two large competitors in the sector. Media reports suggest that Rheinmetall was one of the potential suitors that also looked at TKMS as Thyssenkrupp was considering alternatives for the company before settling on the plan to spin off the naval shipbuilder later this year to shareholders.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23
"Study: Maritime Industry is Trying Out AI, But is Still Skeptical",https://maritime-executive.com/article/study-maritime-industry-is-trying-out-ai-but-is-still-skeptical,,28/08/2025 21:58:59,,"Maritime companies are enthusiastic about AI's potential for streamlining business and operational tasks, but are struggling to move beyond small-scale experiments, according to a new industry study by Marcura and Thetius. The study found that 82 percent of maritime professionals are optimistic about AI's role in their sector, but nearly two-thirds worry that over-reliance on the technology could erode critical human skills and judgment. The overwhelming majority believe that AI tools still need human oversight to make sure that they perform as needed - and it's clear that AI will need human input for data collection, data labeling and prompts, in addition to human evaluation of the outputs. The study, which surveyed more than 130 maritime professionals and conducted in-depth interviews, paints a picture of an industry caught between promise and reality. Though 81 percent of companies are running AI pilot projects, only 11 percent have established formal policies to guide how these technologies should be scaled across their operations. The research identified clear consensus on AI's most promising applications. Nearly all respondents — 97 percent — see benefits in reducing manual workflow inefficiencies, while 87 percent believe AI can improve charter party contract analysis and help spot potential pitfalls. However, more than two-thirds of respondents — 69 percent — expressed concerns that AI solutions might miss critical warning signs in contracts or voyage planning, potentially leading to costly business mistakes. 37 percent said they had personally witnessed AI failures in their organizations, and nearly a quarter of respondents said that AI vendors' claims often fail to match real-world results, The specialized nature of maritime operations are a key factor in these implementation challenges. As anyone in maritime who has tried to use ChatGPT knows, generic AI tools often struggle with the sector's idiosyncratic terms and acronyms, its unique rules and its operational realities - all of which are a foreign language and culture that outsiders have to learn, including software outsiders. ""A general AI agent might interpret 'SF' as 'standard form,' but in shipping, it means 'stowage factor,'"" explained Janani Yagnamurthy, vice president of analytics at Marcura. ""Off-the-shelf solutions might automate basic processes, but they miss the nuanced context that maritime professionals rely on."" The skepticism about AI was highest for legal and compliance tasks; though the legal profession as a whole has adopted widespread use of AI for basic tasks, shipping respondents rated their compliance departments as least-suited for AI usage at present, citing concerns about data governance, regulatory liability and misinterpretation of legal nuances by AI. Maritime-specific, purpose built AI agents may perform better than generic tools for these tasks. Marcura says that its AI-powered contract analysis tools recently helped a dry bulk operator avoid more than $120,000 in potential losses by identifying missing clauses in the draft of an agreement. Despite successes in specific applications, most companies are still just testing the waters, and only 17 percent have established transparent processes for how AI systems inform decisionmaking in their companies. ""When change happens, it's very natural to fear losing control,"" Yagnamurthy said. ""Skilled maritime professionals have spent decades honing their judgment in high-stakes roles. The best AI functions like a co-pilot, not a replacement."" Familiarity and fluency with AI will also need improvement: 38 percent reported that inadequate training is the biggest barrier to scaling up the use of the technology in their business. Poor implementation and poor education of the users can lead to poor outcomes, multiple respondents said. ""People train their AI models but they don’t train their people. If the crew and the office do not understand the AI outputs, it could lead to misuse, which creates mistrust. We need to first train our people and our minds,"" one shipmanager told the research team.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 09:30:23

Pirates Scared Off from Tanker Attack by Approaching Togolese Patrol Boat,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pirates-scared-off-from-tanker-attack-by-approaching-togolese-patrol-boat,,29/08/2025 19:43:40,,"The suspected attack on a small chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in West Africa is over, with the crew reported to be safe and AIS signals showing the vessel underway. The incident took place approximately 60 nautical miles south of Lome, Togo, but details remain unclear. The joint French–British monitoring operation Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) records the incident as concluded and lists it as a small vessel coming in close proximity to the tanker, which has been identified in other reports as the Endo Ponete (7,250 dwt) registered in Malta. Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel had been attacked and termed it an attempted boarding, while Ambrey called it a boarding incident. The vessel was getting underway from Togo and southbound for the Democratic Republic of Congo when the small boat approached. Vanguard reports the captain ordered the crew to muster and enter the citadel, and they notified the local authorities. A Togolese patrol boat was dispatched, and according to the reports, the pirates fled when they saw the approaching naval support. The vessel was searched, and the crew was released from the citadel. There are no reports of damage, but it is unclear if the vessel was boarded. Built in 2010, the tanker, which is 95 meters (312 feet) in length, is reported to have been operating in the region since being acquired by Endo Tankers in June 2023. It previously operated as the Mandume, registered in the Marshall Islands. Product tankers have emerged as a favored target of the pirates in the region. In April, a product tanker was boarded and robbed while off the Nigerian coast, and in the past, product tankers have been robbed of fuel in the region near Cote d’Ivoire. In March, a product tanker was robbed and crewmembers kidnapped further south off the Central African coast. MDAT-GoG reports this is the first incident in the region in at least 90 days. It reported a rash of incidents in the March and April timeframe, but overall, serious crime against merchant ships has been dramatically reduced after peaking in 2020 in the Gulf of Guinea region.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 20:56:46

Ukraine’s Navy confirmed an attack, reporting the death toll has risen to two sailors, while others are missing or injured. Neither side released extensive details, but reports are identifying the vessel as the Simferopol, a reconnaissance vessel built in Ukraine in 2019 based on a trawler. The vessel is 1,220 tons displacement and about 55 meters (180 feet) in length and was designed for 29 crew. It was outfitted with electronic intelligence and surveillance equipment in support of the Ukrainian Navy’s operations. The vessel was reported to be operating in the Danube Delta region when it was struck on August 28. Russia’s statement claimed the vessel was sunk, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy today on television said they could not confirm that the vessel had sunk.

They declined to say how many sailors are missing or injured, with the spokesperson emphasizing that most of the sailors were safe. They said the Russian naval drones were known and that there had been attempts in the past to deploy them in the Black Sea. This was the first known successful attack using the naval drones. Ukraine has successfully deployed a range of naval and aerial drones during the campaign, inflicting a range of losses on the Russian Navy and support vessels. Yesterday, Ukraine claimed that it had successfully attacked a Russian naval vessel deep inside Crimea in what was being described as a bold attack far behind enemy lines. Last month, a Ukrainian dredger working in the Danube reportedly struck a mine, killing three crewmembers. The canal connecting to the Danube was closed for weeks before it reopened.",Maritime Executive,29/08/2025 20:56:46

Evolving Role for Ship Managers,https://maritime-executive.com/article/evolving-role-for-ship-managers,,30/08/2025 03:53:38,,"Ship management is often identified as a tool for smaller fleets or individual shipowners to run their ships and keep up with the majors. The leading ship managers, however, say the practice is evolving from technical skills to incorporate consulting and advising as the shipping business is confronted with new challenges ranging from geopolitical issues to emerging technologies, increasing regulations and a shortage of seafarers. The emergence of the ship management industry was driven by a basic desire to achieve cost efficiencies, often through scale, while also ensuring regulatory compliance - all to permit owners to focus on the commercial rather than technical aspects of operations. Historically, ship management was mostly used by owners with smaller portfolios who lacked in-house expertise and found value in outsourcing. ""It's been an industry driven by standardized solutions designed to streamline operations and costs,"" says Mark O'Neil, CEO of Columbia Group. The model was designed, however, for a more stable and predictable era, when owners could rely on internal resources and conventional advisory partnerships to navigate relatively stable markets and regulatory environments. Despite rapid growth and increasing demands on shipowners, ship management companies only handle about 20 percent of the global commercial fleet. The other 80 percent, notes Niraj Nanda, Chief Commercial Officer of Anglo-Eastern, which has been in the business for over 50 years, is managed in-house. Integrated Approach As ships have gotten bigger and economic pressures have increased, the scope of work for ship managers has changed. Today, it requires an integrated approach to ensure safety, efficiency and regulatory compliance, according to Lisa Holum, Managing Director of OSM Thome Singapore. Tracing its roots back to the 1963 founding of Thome in Singapore and formed by the 2023 merger with OSM Maritime Group, OSM Thome encompasses not only technical management but also crew, compliance, procurement and sustainability initiatives. ""The ship management industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from being a cost-based, task-oriented service to becoming a strategic value partner to shipowners,"" explains Ajay Chaudhry, Co-CEO – Ship Management, Synergy Marine Group. ""At Synergy, we believe the practice is being reshaped by three forces: regulatory pressure, technological maturity and rising expectations around crew wellbeing."" Emerging regulations around decarbonization and crew safety, for example, mean ship management is shifting from an operations focus to a value focus. The role of a ship manager is being fundamentally redefined with a shift towards risk mitigation, creating strategic advantages and providing access to specialized capabilities that owners cannot easily develop in-house. ""Owners give their vessels to a third-party manager so they can focus on their core competence of managing their vessels commercially while the manager specializes in operating ships efficiently and safely,"" says Ioannis Stefanou, Managing Director, Ship Management at Wallem Group. ""When we partner with an owner, we don't just manage their vessels. We also offer consultancy advice and added value services to take care of their very expensive assets."" The pressures on shipowners are driving many of the changes in the industry. ""Ship management is moving towards more of a global solution,"" says Captain Kuba Szymanski, General Secretary of InterManager, the only organization dedicated to representing the ship management industry. ""New requirements are making the role of a ship manager more like a business partner and not just a service provider."" Owners expect managers to deliver not only operational excellence but also guidance on decarbonization, digital solutions, regulatory compliance and crew challenges. ""We're moving beyond traditional ship management to offer a fully integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, energy and offshore services platform,"" highlights Columbia's O'Neil, noting that Columbia takes a holistic approach, combining digital tools, maritime HR, AI, sustainability and more. Ownership Changes Further driving change is a shift in the ownership profile of the shipping industry. In addition to the emergence of massive fleets, shipping has become more specialized with unique vessels for each segment and new types of owners. Capt. Szymanski of Inter- Manager notes ship managers already occupy the ""top end,"" serving LNG, LPG and tankers, but he sees the service ""now drifting toward"" bulk carriers and containerships. Other sectors, including ro-ros, passenger vessels and cruise ships, have also turned to outside managers, especially as they enter new markets. Ownership is moving from the traditional private families and legacy fleets to institutional investors, energy majors and first-time entrants who expect enterprise-grade governance, sustainability credentials and strategic alignment. ""We see a notable increase in leasing companies purchasing vessels, both newbuilds and resale tonnage, and then chartering them out on long-term or bareboat terms,"" says OSM Thome's Holum, who notes these new entrants rely on third-party managers. ""Many of these lessors are financial institutions without in-house technical management expertise."" The new owners include private equity firms and other non-maritime investors as well. Adds Anglo-Eastern's Nanda: ""These new stakeholders often lack operational expertise in ship management, creating opportunities for ship managers to provide end-to-end solutions."" Crew Scarcity Stricter environmental regulations, rapid technological advances, geopolitical instability and economic volatility have meant that managing a ship has never been more complex. However, the biggest challenge across all sectors of the industry may be crew scarcity and the related issues of aging seafarers and low participation rates from traditional sources of seafarers. The U.N.-led Maritime Just Transition Task Force recently highlighted that hundreds of thousands of seafarers must also be upskilled to prepare for the handling of methanol and then ammonia and hydrogen as future alternative fuels. The largest ship managers operate their own training centers, and some run pre-sea training programs. Anglo- Eastern, for example, has expanded its simulation-based training facilities with the leading engine companies - MAN Energy Solutions (now Everllence), WinGD and Wärtsilä - and launched the industry's first LNG/Ammonia bunkering station skid at its Maritime Institute in Mumbai, India. ""A ship is only as good as the crew we can place on it,"" says Sebastian von Hardenberg, CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. ""As we introduce future fuels to the maritime sector, safeguarding the crew and the vessels they operate through proper training must come first."" The company is taking proactive steps to close the skills gap, investing in training programs, simulation technology and collaborative forums. It established internal expert groups to design vessel-specific training modules covering everything from bunkering and emergency response to cargo handling protocols. In 2024, BSM launched its Smart Academy program to give undergraduate cadets training in a controlled and realistic work environment onshore and onboard, including training on a bridge simulator. Wallem has an in-house saying that ""The ships of the future will not be managed by the managers of the past."" It notes that new skills are required as digitalization spreads through shipping. ""The young generation of seafarers is tech savvy and computer skills come naturally to them,"" says Stefanou. Wallem has set up training for the use of methanol and ammonia and helped customers with wind-assisted propul- sion. With a focus on crew wellbeing, it conducted over 7,000 hours of training in 2024 and has a ""Mental Health Wellbeing Champion” onboard every ship. Anglo-Eastern's Nanda says, ""Attracting and retaining skilled seafarers remains a pressing issue, requiring innovative recruitment and training strategies."" In June, the company launched its Mission 30 initiative with the goal of increasing the proportion of management-level officers under the age of 30 from one percent to 30 percent by 2030. Next Challenges ""Owners increasingly need advisors who understand global complexity and can act as strategic partners, not just service providers,"" concludes Columbia's O'Neil. ""The next big challenges include talent retention, the mental health of seafarers, geopolitical instability and generational shifts in expectations. Ship managers must evolve from reactive support to proactive problem-solvers."" All the companies point to their efforts to develop specialized services and teams to address the emerging challenges. V. Group, for example, launched V.ERDE to address decarbonization while OSM Thome launched its green services division, EVIGO. Bernhard Schulte introduced LiveFleet, a single data source platform to monitor compliance with regulations, while Anglo-Eastern, through its newbuilding and project management divisions - Anglo-Eastern Technical Services (AETS) and SeaQuest - is expanding its involvement in future-fuel ship design. ""Beyond fuel and emissions, the next frontier of challenges lies in managing operational complexity, specifically around data governance, workforce transformation and asset lifecycle alignment,"" says Synergy's Chaudhry. ""Owners today are overwhelmed with compliance obligations, ESG disclosures and performance benchmarking, often across multiple jurisdictions and systems. The ship manager's role is no longer operational alone. It's increasingly strategic helping owners anticipate disruption, adapt with agility and remain competitive in a rapidly changing seascape."" Lifecycle Custodians Ship managers must now serve as ""lifecycle custodians,"" expanding their services to encompass broader challenges. To protect the financial interests of their clients, managers must advise on a growing range of issues to help guide owners through the dynamic maritime industry and anticipate the challenges that lie ahead. – MarEx Allan Jordan is the magazine's Associate Editor This article originally appeared in the July-August 2025 issue of The Maritime Executive.

Built in 1943 in Ohio by the American Ship Building Company, Cuyahoga was a historic bulk freighter launched as the J. Burton Ayers to transport iron ore during World War II. She was later converted into a self-unloading ship and was renamed Cuyahoga in 1995 by Lower Lakes Towing, part of Rand Logistics. Her original steam plant was finally converted to diesel in 2000, and she continued to maintain seasonal services on the Lakes transporting dry bulk commodities like coal, salt, grain, and crushed stone. On May 23, 2023, the Cuyahoga left Marblehead, Ohio, on a regular voyage bound for Kingsville. Three hours into the voyage, a fire ignited in the engine room, forcing the 20 crewmembers to initiate emergency responses. The 620-foot (189-meter) vessel was loaded with 11,400 metric tonnes of granular crushed stone. To avert a disaster, the crew responded by cutting the fuel supply to the main engine before attempting to activate the vessel’s carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed fire suppression system remotely, which was without success. An attempt to locally activate the system also failed and resulted in the cylinder room flooding with CO2. However, due to the cessation of fuel flow, the engine stopped, and the fire extinguished itself soon after as the vessel was anchored north of Pelee Island, Ontario. TSB investigators established that the fire was caused by fuel spraying from a disconnected injection line onto exposed hot surfaces of the engine’s exhaust gas piping. It emerged that after an earlier repair, the retaining clamps were not reinstalled on the fuel injection lines, increasing the effects of engine vibration, something that made the lines susceptible to loosening. TSB terms it one of the many casual repairs that were undertaken on the aging bulker. Following the earlier engine repair, recurring minor leaks were addressed as routine maintenance without investigating the underlying cause. Although the practice deviated from the manufacturer's specifications, the crew was unaware as they lacked regular access to updated maintenance and torque specifications from the engine manufacturers. The investigation established that while vibration is inherent in all diesel engines due to various factors, the Cuyahoga’s main engine systems showed the effects of excessive engine vibration. To reduce the effects of vibration on the fuel injection line fittings, retaining clamps had been added to secure the fuel injection lines to the cylinder heads, making the lines more rigid and reducing mechanical vibration in the fuel injection lines. TSB writes in its report that Cuyahoga's fuel injection return line for cylinder 7 was disconnected, which resulted in a spray of marine diesel oil. They believe all the retaining clamps on the fuel injection lines were most likely removed in 2021 when the crew replaced the fuel supply and return manifolds. The CO2 fire suppression system failed due to several factors, reports TSB. The remote release cables had been routed through the engine room and were damaged by the fire, rendering them inoperative. When the crew attempted a manual release, TSB reports the system discharged CO2 into the cylinder room instead of the engine room, due to incorrect activation instructions and loose or missing components. Two days after the fire, the vessel was towed to Kingsville. No injuries or pollution were reported, but the bulker’s engine room and associated machinery sustained heat and smoke damage. The main engine and various electrical cables and equipment also sustained moderate to severe fire damage. Although the aged vessel returned to service following the incident, another fire broke out while she was docked in Ashtabula, southwest of Erie, Ohio, on Lake Erie, in March 2024. That fire occurred while the vessel was being prepared after winter layup, but it ended her long career. In July, Cuyahoga was towed into the IMS Docks for scrapping. TSB warns that the issues raised in this investigation, particularly around emergency procedures and the use and maintenance of fixed fire suppression systems, are not unique and affect the safety of marine transportation across Canada. The safety organization reports it started a more wide-reaching national safety issue investigation in July 2025 after having raised concerns about these issues for years. TSB says it is in the process of building a clearer understanding of how vessel fires are currently managed and identifying the gaps in Canada’s preparedness for marine emergencies.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
Malfunction on Research Vessel Falkor (too) Stops Uruguay's Expedition,https://maritime-executive.com/article/malfunction-on-research-vessel-falkor-too-stops-uruguay-s-expedition,,30/08/2025 02:10:39,,"A high-profile research expedition to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan sovereign waters has suffered a setback after the research vessel Falkor (too) suffered technical issues. The vessel was forced to return to port for repairs. The Universidad de la República (Udelar) announced that only days after embarking on August 22 for the much-publicized ‘Uruguay SUB 200’ expedition, the vessel was returning to the Port of Montevideo. The expedition had received the attention of President Yamandú Orsi. The ship, which is owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) and is highlighted as one of the most advanced research vessels, is said to have suffered issues with the main structure that is used to deploy and recover heavy underwater equipment. The A-frame structure malfunctioned as it was being raised from its stowed position to vertical, forcing a return to port for repairs. “It's with great sadness that we inform you that we're returning to port to fix some technical issues. We hope it's resolved soon and we can get back to exploring our ocean,” said the University in an alert. The vessel had departed for the mission to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan waters with a team of 37 scientists and technicians from 18 institutions in six countries. Dubbed ‘Uruguay SUB 200: Journey into the Unknown,’ the month-long expedition was aimed at studying marine ecology, underwater archaeology, deep-sea mapping, and marine geophysics, among others. The mission would have seen Falkor (too) sail about 200 to 300 kilometers off the Uruguayan coast to explore 50 points of interest on the seabed, from 200 to 3,500 meters deep. Of critical importance was the fact that the scientific team was expected to share the mission’s experience through live broadcasts from high-quality images taken on the seabed by the vessel’s suBastian remotely operated vehicle that is capable of reaching depths of 4,500 meters. Built in 2011 as the offshore industry vessel Polar Queen, SOI acquired Falkor (too) from Norwegian shipping company GC Rieber Shipping ASA. The 110-meter vessel was refitted to become a state-of-the-art mobile research facility with modern laboratories, tools, equipment, and a high-performance computing system for ocean exploration and study. The vessel has an endurance of 60 to 120 days. The name was chosen to continue the tradition of an earlier vessel. The original Falkor was donated to Italy’s science agency National Research Council (CNR), in 2022. Earlier this month, Falkor (too) completed a three-week Argentinian-led expedition that studied the Mar del Plata Canyon, one of the country’s largest underwater canyons that is located 300 kilometers offshore. Early this year, the Class C polar certified vessel also completed its first science expedition to Antarctica.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
Arrest Warrant Issued After Captain Skips Hearing on Intoxication Charge,https://maritime-executive.com/article/arrest-warrant-issued-after-captain-skips-hearing-on-intoxication-charge,,30/08/2025 01:42:19,,"The containership captain, who was arrested on charges that he was operating his vessel while intoxicated, failed to show for a court hearing this week. The King County District Court in Washington State issued a $10,000 warrant for his arrest on August 27 after both the captain and his lawyer did not attend a scheduled pre-trial hearing. Oleh Danylin, age 48 and a Ukrainian citizen, was charged on August 25 with operating the vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX (108,770 dwt / 8,800 TEU), while intoxicated after having been reported by a Puget Sound pilot. The first officer of the containership had assumed command of the vessel and, along with the pilot, navigated the ship from the anchorage in Everett, Washington, to the berth in Seattle. The ship was detained until MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company supplied a replacement captain. The court had ordered Danylin to remain in the state, not to consume alcohol, and that his passport should be in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard. Court papers from when he was charged reflect that he was requesting an interpreter, but pleaded not guilty to the charge. A U.S. Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service had boarded the ship, and according to court papers, the captain agreed to a sobriety test. Court papers said he was performing so poorly, the investigators stopped the test for his own safety. He later told investigators that he had not consumed alcohol in two months. He said the smell the pilot reported was “likely mouthwash” he used 10 minutes prior. However, he had agreed to the sobriety test and then a chemical breath test given by the Coast Guard, which showed 0.24 percent blood alcohol. He took two additional breath tests administered that same afternoon by the Washington State Patrol, and both registered 0.25 percent blood alcohol content. The Coast Guard imposed $1,000 civil penalty, and Danylin was charged and appeared before the judge on August 25. The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to attend a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
USCG Lifts Hatch Cover as It Investigates Baltimore Bulker Explosion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-lifts-hatch-cover-as-it-investigates-baltimore-bulker-explosion,,30/08/2025 00:21:35,,"The hatch cover that was blown overboard during the explosion on the bulker W-Sapphire was retrieved from the Baltimore shipping channel on Thursday, August 28. It is part of the ongoing investigation into the incident 10 days ago, on August 18, shortly after the vessel departed the coal terminal in Baltimore. The Fort McHenry Federal Channel leading into and out of the Port of Baltimore was closed to vessel traffic on Thursday from 0730 to 1500 local time. A 500-yard safety zone radius was established around the location of the hatch cover at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay. Dive and salvage operations were undertaken. By mid-afternoon, the USCG posted that the 30-ton hatch had been successfully retrieved from the Patapsco River. The safety zone restriction was removed and the channel reopened. Army Corps surveying the harbor area after the explosion (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore District had assisted the USCG and deployed its survey vessel Buck to conduct sonar surveys around Baltimore's Fort McHenry Channel on August 19, the day after the explosion. Captain Jake Tuer, who conducted the survey, reported that the data collected during this process would help determine the operational plan moving forward, including reopening the channel that day and yesterday’s recovery. The 751-foot bulker W-Sapphire remains anchored in the channel near Sandy Point State Park and north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The ship had been escorted into the anchorage shortly after the explosion and will remain there while the USCG and state authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion. Initial radio calls from the vessel said there was possibly water intake into the hold, but the force of the explosion appears to have mostly been driven upward, breaking through the hatch cover. Bulker being escorted out of the channel after the explosion on August 18 (North Point - Edgemere Volunteer Fire Department) Investigators are looking into the cause of the explosion, which ripped the hatch cover off the vessel’s number 2 hold. One leaf remained on deck while the other went overboard. There was a massive fireball, which observers said went several hundred feet into the air, followed by a smoke plume. Coal dust explosions are typically a secondary result of another trigger and require a mix of fuel, heat, and oxygen with the dust suspended in the air. They are reported to be considering spontaneous combustion as well as an external source of heat or fire that contributed to the explosion.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
"Israel Responds to Turkish Trade Ban, Moves Tugboat Order to Bulgaria",https://maritime-executive.com/article/israel-responds-to-turkish-trade-ban-moves-tugboat-order-to-bulgaria,,29/08/2025 22:49:16,,"The Israel Ports Company, which oversees the operations of the country’s ports, along with the Ministry of Transport, is reporting that they have moved an order for two advanced technology tugboats to a shipyard in Bulgaria in response to the actions of the Turkish government. According to the reports, the order was valued at $30 million and had previously been with an unnamed Turkish shipbuilder. News of the change came as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed in a speech to parliament today, August 29, the country’s new actions against Israel. As has been reported, Turkey is banning Israeli ships from its ports, ships transporting military cargo for Israel, and also, according to the minister, has closed its airspace. Turkish ships are also prohibited from calling at Israeli ports, expanding on a trade ban the government imposed last year. “Our decision to replace the Turkish shipyard with a friendly shipyard in Bulgaria is an expression of a clear policy,” said Miri Regev of the Minister of Transportation and Road Safety, according to a report in the Israeli news outlet Haipo. “We will not give in to boycotts, but will continue to ensure the strengthening of the ports, the continuity of service, and the independence of the State of Israel's operations.” The Haifa Maritime Transport Company signed the new contract with Bulgaria’s MTG Dolphin shipyard in Varna, Bulgaria. They will build two tugs to be delivered to the port by the end of 2026. ""The new tugboats are an integral part of our preparations for the coming years,” said Moshe Ben Zaken, Director General of the Ministry of Transportation. “We are working determinedly to provide Israel's ports with the most advanced technological tools to deal with the constant increase in the volume of maritime traffic."" The new tugs will be the most powerful yet deployed in Israel, with a pulling capacity of 85 tons. They will use Rotor tug technology. The plan calls for the new vessels to replace two of the four tugs currently operating in the Haifa port. Israel in April acquired for approximately $14.6 million a tug named Almog. The VECTOR model tug has a pulling capacity of 73 tons and is currently the most powerful in the country. It was deployed to the port of Ashdod and operates in the southern part of the country. Turkey has historically been a strong trading partner with Israel. It was exporting building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment to Israel. The Bank of Israel reported more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 embargo, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 04:26:53
DOT and MARAD Pull Nearly $700M in Port and Wind Terminal Grants,https://maritime-executive.com/article/dot-and-marad-pull-nearly-700m-in-port-and-wind-terminal-grants,,29/08/2025 21:13:55,,"The efforts to detail the U.S. offshore wind power industry are continuing with the US Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) terminating and withdrawing nearly $700 million in grants made by the Biden administration for wind ports and terminals. In total, they identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections in discretionary grant programs to be canceled. The press statement references “doomed offshore wind projects,” saying the funding will be prioritized toward restoring America’s maritime dominance. They report that DOT and MARAD are refocusing on “rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources.” DOT has withdrawn one project from the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program, saving they report roughly $427 million. MARAD has withdrawn six projects, retracting $177 million, and terminated six projects in the Port Infrastructure Development Program, saving roughly $75 million. It totals $679 million in grants. “The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,"" said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit supporting offshore wind and ocean energy. ""Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries; however, by selectively limiting infrastructure investments and removing mandated agreements in energy and shipyards, the administration is stalling essential development that delivers on shared priorities of national security and energy dominance, and signals to the investment community the U.S. is not safe place for investment."" The largest project included in the list is California’s Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, which loses roughly $427 million in grants. The list also includes major wind projects including the Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts which was terminated at a saving of roughly $33.8 million, the Norfolk (Virginia) Offshore Wind Logistics Port ($39 million), Sparrows Point (Maryland) Steel Marshalling Port ($47 million), New Jersey’s Wind Port at Paulsboro ($20 million), Arthur Kill (New York) Terminal ($48 million) and the Redwood (California) Marine Terminal ($8.7 million). It also includes $10.5 million for the Bridgeport Port Authority (Connecticut) for the Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project. The Port of Davisville (Rhode Island) loses $11.25 million. The Lake Erie Renewable energy project ($11 million), Radio Island Rail Improvements (North Carolina) loses $1.7 million, and Portsmouth Marine Terminal (Virginia) loses $20 million. The statement says that, where possible, funding from these projects will be ""recompeted"" to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States. “Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” The accusations from Duffy and the Trump administration ignore the extensive investments made by the offshore wind industry into shipbuilding and the revitalization of ports such as Salem, Bridgeport, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. In 2023, President Joe Biden highlighted that companies had announced 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects as well as investments of nearly $3.5 billion across 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to strengthen the American offshore wind supply chain. The vessels ranged from the first Jones Act-compliant installation vessels to SOVs and crew transfer vessels. They were being built at shipyards ranging from Florida to Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Many of the projects went to smaller shipyards to build crew transfer vessels. Among the large projects were SOVs built by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana and Fincantieri Bay in Wisconsin.

Evolving Role for Ship Managers,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/evolving-role-for-ship-managers,,30/08/2025 03:53:38,,"Ship management is often identified as a tool for smaller fleets or individual shipowners to run their ships and keep up with the majors. The leading ship managers, however, say the practice is evolving from technical skills to incorporate consulting and advising as the shipping business is confronted with new challenges ranging from geopolitical issues to emerging technologies, increasing regulations and a shortage of seafarers. The emergence of the ship management industry was driven by a basic desire to achieve cost efficiencies, often through scale, while also ensuring regulatory compliance - all to permit owners to focus on the commercial rather than technical aspects of operations. Historically, ship management was mostly used by owners with smaller portfolios who lacked in-house expertise and found value in outsourcing. ""It's been an industry driven by standardized solutions designed to streamline operations and costs,"" says Mark O'Neil, CEO of Columbia Group. The model was designed, however, for a more stable and predictable era, when owners could rely on internal resources and conventional advisory partnerships to navigate relatively stable markets and regulatory environments. Despite rapid growth and increasing demands on shipowners, ship management companies only handle about 20 percent of the global commercial fleet. The other 80 percent, notes Niraj Nanda, Chief Commercial Officer of Anglo-Eastern, which has been in the business for over 50 years, is managed in-house. Integrated Approach As ships have gotten bigger and economic pressures have increased, the scope of work for ship managers has changed. Today, it requires an integrated approach to ensure safety, efficiency and regulatory compliance, according to Lisa Holum, Managing Director of OSM Thome Singapore. Tracing its roots back to the 1963 founding of Thome in Singapore and formed by the 2023 merger with OSM Maritime Group, OSM Thome encompasses not only technical management but also crew, compliance, procurement and sustainability initiatives. ""The ship management industry is undergoing a fundamental shift from being a cost-based, task-oriented service to becoming a strategic value partner to shipowners,"" explains Ajay Chaudhry, Co-CEO – Ship Management, Synergy Marine Group. ""At Synergy, we believe the practice is being reshaped by three forces: regulatory pressure, technological maturity and rising expectations around crew wellbeing."" Emerging regulations around decarbonization and crew safety, for example, mean ship management is shifting from an operations focus to a value focus. The role of a ship manager is being fundamentally redefined with a shift towards risk mitigation, creating strategic advantages and providing access to specialized capabilities that owners cannot easily develop in-house. ""Owners give their vessels to a third-party manager so they can focus on their core competence of managing their vessels commercially while the manager specializes in operating ships efficiently and safely,"" says Ioannis Stefanou, Managing Director, Ship Management at Wallem Group. ""When we partner with an owner, we don't just manage their vessels. We also offer consultancy advice and added value services to take care of their very expensive assets."" The pressures on shipowners are driving many of the changes in the industry. ""Ship management is moving towards more of a global solution,"" says Captain Kuba Szymanski, General Secretary of InterManager, the only organization dedicated to representing the ship management industry. ""New requirements are making the role of a ship manager more like a business partner and not just a service provider."" Owners expect managers to deliver not only operational excellence but also guidance on decarbonization, digital solutions, regulatory compliance and crew challenges. ""We're moving beyond traditional ship management to offer a fully integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, energy and offshore services platform,"" highlights Columbia's O'Neil, noting that Columbia takes a holistic approach, combining digital tools, maritime HR, AI, sustainability and more. Ownership Changes Further driving change is a shift in the ownership profile of the shipping industry. In addition to the emergence of massive fleets, shipping has become more specialized with unique vessels for each segment and new types of owners. Capt. Szymanski of Inter- Manager notes ship managers already occupy the ""top end,"" serving LNG, LPG and tankers, but he sees the service ""now drifting toward"" bulk carriers and containerships. Other sectors, including ro-ros, passenger vessels and cruise ships, have also turned to outside managers, especially as they enter new markets. Ownership is moving from the traditional private families and legacy fleets to institutional investors, energy majors and first-time entrants who expect enterprise-grade governance, sustainability credentials and strategic alignment. ""We see a notable increase in leasing companies purchasing vessels, both newbuilds and resale tonnage, and then chartering them out on long-term or bareboat terms,"" says OSM Thome's Holum, who notes these new entrants rely on third-party managers. ""Many of these lessors are financial institutions without in-house technical management expertise."" The new owners include private equity firms and other non-maritime investors as well. Adds Anglo-Eastern's Nanda: ""These new stakeholders often lack operational expertise in ship management, creating opportunities for ship managers to provide end-to-end solutions."" Crew Scarcity Stricter environmental regulations, rapid technological advances, geopolitical instability and economic volatility have meant that managing a ship has never been more complex. However, the biggest challenge across all sectors of the industry may be crew scarcity and the related issues of aging seafarers and low participation rates from traditional sources of seafarers. The U.N.-led Maritime Just Transition Task Force recently highlighted that hundreds of thousands of seafarers must also be upskilled to prepare for the handling of methanol and then ammonia and hydrogen as future alternative fuels. The largest ship managers operate their own training centers, and some run pre-sea training programs. Anglo- Eastern, for example, has expanded its simulation-based training facilities with the leading engine companies - MAN Energy Solutions (now Everllence), WinGD and Wärtsilä - and launched the industry's first LNG/Ammonia bunkering station skid at its Maritime Institute in Mumbai, India. ""A ship is only as good as the crew we can place on it,"" says Sebastian von Hardenberg, CEO of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. ""As we introduce future fuels to the maritime sector, safeguarding the crew and the vessels they operate through proper training must come first."" The company is taking proactive steps to close the skills gap, investing in training programs, simulation technology and collaborative forums. It established internal expert groups to design vessel-specific training modules covering everything from bunkering and emergency response to cargo handling protocols. In 2024, BSM launched its Smart Academy program to give undergraduate cadets training in a controlled and realistic work environment onshore and onboard, including training on a bridge simulator. Wallem has an in-house saying that ""The ships of the future will not be managed by the managers of the past."" It notes that new skills are required as digitalization spreads through shipping. ""The young generation of seafarers is tech savvy and computer skills come naturally to them,"" says Stefanou. Wallem has set up training for the use of methanol and ammonia and helped customers with wind-assisted propul- sion. With a focus on crew wellbeing, it conducted over 7,000 hours of training in 2024 and has a ""Mental Health Wellbeing Champion” onboard every ship. Anglo-Eastern's Nanda says, ""Attracting and retaining skilled seafarers remains a pressing issue, requiring innovative recruitment and training strategies."" In June, the company launched its Mission 30 initiative with the goal of increasing the proportion of management-level officers under the age of 30 from one percent to 30 percent by 2030. Next Challenges ""Owners increasingly need advisors who understand global complexity and can act as strategic partners, not just service providers,"" concludes Columbia's O'Neil. ""The next big challenges include talent retention, the mental health of seafarers, geopolitical instability and generational shifts in expectations. Ship managers must evolve from reactive support to proactive problem-solvers."" All the companies point to their efforts to develop specialized services and teams to address the emerging challenges. V. Group, for example, launched V.ERDE to address decarbonization while OSM Thome launched its green services division, EVIGO. Bernhard Schulte introduced LiveFleet, a single data source platform to monitor compliance with regulations, while Anglo-Eastern, through its newbuilding and project management divisions - Anglo-Eastern Technical Services (AETS) and SeaQuest - is expanding its involvement in future-fuel ship design. ""Beyond fuel and emissions, the next frontier of challenges lies in managing operational complexity, specifically around data governance, workforce transformation and asset lifecycle alignment,"" says Synergy's Chaudhry. ""Owners today are overwhelmed with compliance obligations, ESG disclosures and performance benchmarking, often across multiple jurisdictions and systems. The ship manager's role is no longer operational alone. It's increasingly strategic helping owners anticipate disruption, adapt with agility and remain competitive in a rapidly changing seascape."" Lifecycle Custodians Ship managers must now serve as ""lifecycle custodians,"" expanding their services to encompass broader challenges.

TSB: Fuel Leak Due to Casual Repair Caused Fire on Canada’s Oldest Laker,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/tsb-fuel-leak-due-to-casual-repair-caused-fire-on-canada-s-oldest-laker,,30/08/2025 02:47:45,,"The fire that broke out in the engine room of Canada’s oldest vessel operating on the Great Lakes in 2023, the Cuyaoga, was a disaster waiting to happen, according to a new report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB). The report cites a history of repeated fuel leaks and dangers that were often resolved with casual repairs on fuel injection pipes. Built in 1943 in Ohio by the American Ship Building Company, Cuyahoga was a historic bulk freighter launched as the J. Burton Ayers to transport iron ore during World War II. She was later converted into a self-unloading ship and was renamed Cuyahoga in 1995 by Lower Lakes Towing, part of Rand Logistics. Her original steam plant was finally converted to diesel in 2000, and she continued to maintain seasonal services on the Lakes transporting dry bulk commodities like coal, salt, grain, and crushed stone. On May 23, 2023, the Cuyahoga left Marblehead, Ohio, on a regular voyage bound for Kingsville. Three hours into the voyage, a fire ignited in the engine room, forcing the 20 crewmembers to initiate emergency responses. The 620-foot (189-meter) vessel was loaded with 11,400 metric tonnes of granular crushed stone. To avert a disaster, the crew responded by cutting the fuel supply to the main engine before attempting to activate the vessel’s carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed fire suppression system remotely, which was without success. An attempt to locally activate the system also failed and resulted in the cylinder room flooding with CO2. However, due to the cessation of fuel flow, the engine stopped, and the fire extinguished itself soon after as the vessel was anchored north of Pelee Island, Ontario. TSB investigators established that the fire was caused by fuel spraying from a disconnected injection line onto exposed hot surfaces of the engine’s exhaust gas piping. It emerged that after an earlier repair, the retaining clamps were not reinstalled on the fuel injection lines, increasing the effects of engine vibration, something that made the lines susceptible to loosening. TSB terms it one of the many casual repairs that were undertaken on the aging bulker. Following the earlier engine repair, recurring minor leaks were addressed as routine maintenance without investigating the underlying cause. Although the practice deviated from the manufacturer's specifications, the crew was unaware as they lacked regular access to updated maintenance and torque specifications from the engine manufacturers. The investigation established that while vibration is inherent in all diesel engines due to various factors, the Cuyahoga’s main engine systems showed the effects of excessive engine vibration. To reduce the effects of vibration on the fuel injection line fittings, retaining clamps had been added to secure the fuel injection lines to the cylinder heads, making the lines more rigid and reducing mechanical vibration in the fuel injection lines. TSB writes in its report that Cuyahoga's fuel injection return line for cylinder 7 was disconnected, which resulted in a spray of marine diesel oil. They believe all the retaining clamps on the fuel injection lines were most likely removed in 2021 when the crew replaced the fuel supply and return manifolds. The CO2 fire suppression system failed due to several factors, reports TSB. The remote release cables had been routed through the engine room and were damaged by the fire, rendering them inoperative. When the crew attempted a manual release, TSB reports the system discharged CO2 into the cylinder room instead of the engine room, due to incorrect activation instructions and loose or missing components. Two days after the fire, the vessel was towed to Kingsville. No injuries or pollution were reported, but the bulker’s engine room and associated machinery sustained heat and smoke damage. The main engine and various electrical cables and equipment also sustained moderate to severe fire damage. Although the aged vessel returned to service following the incident, another fire broke out while she was docked in Ashtabula, southwest of Erie, Ohio, on Lake Erie, in March 2024. That fire occurred while the vessel was being prepared after winter layup, but it ended her long career. In July, Cuyahoga was towed into the IMS Docks for scrapping. TSB warns that the issues raised in this investigation, particularly around emergency procedures and the use and maintenance of fixed fire suppression systems, are not unique and affect the safety of marine transportation across Canada. The safety organization reports it started a more wide-reaching national safety issue investigation in July 2025 after having raised concerns about these issues for years. TSB says it is in the process of building a clearer understanding of how vessel fires are currently managed and identifying the gaps in Canada’s preparedness for marine emergencies.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Malfunction on Research Vessel Falkor (too) Stops Uruguay's Expedition,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/malfunction-on-research-vessel-falkor-too-stops-uruguay-s-expedition,,30/08/2025 02:10:39,,"A high-profile research expedition to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan sovereign waters has suffered a setback after the research vessel Falkor (too) suffered technical issues. The vessel was forced to return to port for repairs. The Universidad de la República (Udelar) announced that only days after embarking on August 22 for the much-publicized ‘Uruguay SUB 200’ expedition, the vessel was returning to the Port of Montevideo. The expedition had received the attention of President Yamandú Orsi. The ship, which is owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) and is highlighted as one of the most advanced research vessels, is said to have suffered issues with the main structure that is used to deploy and recover heavy underwater equipment. The A-frame structure malfunctioned as it was being raised from its stowed position to vertical, forcing a return to port for repairs. “It's with great sadness that we inform you that we're returning to port to fix some technical issues. We hope it's resolved soon and we can get back to exploring our ocean,” said the University in an alert. The vessel had departed for the mission to explore the deep sea in Uruguayan waters with a team of 37 scientists and technicians from 18 institutions in six countries. Dubbed ‘Uruguay SUB 200: Journey into the Unknown,’ the month-long expedition was aimed at studying marine ecology, underwater archaeology, deep-sea mapping, and marine geophysics, among others. The mission would have seen Falkor (too) sail about 200 to 300 kilometers off the Uruguayan coast to explore 50 points of interest on the seabed, from 200 to 3,500 meters deep. Of critical importance was the fact that the scientific team was expected to share the mission’s experience through live broadcasts from high-quality images taken on the seabed by the vessel’s suBastian remotely operated vehicle that is capable of reaching depths of 4,500 meters. Built in 2011 as the offshore industry vessel Polar Queen, SOI acquired Falkor (too) from Norwegian shipping company GC Rieber Shipping ASA. The 110-meter vessel was refitted to become a state-of-the-art mobile research facility with modern laboratories, tools, equipment, and a high-performance computing system for ocean exploration and study. The vessel has an endurance of 60 to 120 days. The name was chosen to continue the tradition of an earlier vessel. The original Falkor was donated to Italy’s science agency National Research Council (CNR), in 2022. Earlier this month, Falkor (too) completed a three-week Argentinian-led expedition that studied the Mar del Plata Canyon, one of the country’s largest underwater canyons that is located 300 kilometers offshore. Early this year, the Class C polar certified vessel also completed its first science expedition to Antarctica.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Arrest Warrant Issued After Captain Skips Hearing on Intoxication Charge,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/arrest-warrant-issued-after-captain-skips-hearing-on-intoxication-charge,,30/08/2025 01:42:19,,"The containership captain, who was arrested on charges that he was operating his vessel while intoxicated, failed to show for a court hearing this week. The King County District Court in Washington State issued a $10,000 warrant for his arrest on August 27 after both the captain and his lawyer did not attend a scheduled pre-trial hearing. Oleh Danylin, age 48 and a Ukrainian citizen, was charged on August 25 with operating the vessel, the MSC Jubilee IX (108,770 dwt / 8,800 TEU), while intoxicated after having been reported by a Puget Sound pilot. The first officer of the containership had assumed command of the vessel and, along with the pilot, navigated the ship from the anchorage in Everett, Washington, to the berth in Seattle. The ship was detained until MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company supplied a replacement captain. The court had ordered Danylin to remain in the state, not to consume alcohol, and that his passport should be in the custody of the U.S. Coast Guard. Court papers from when he was charged reflect that he was requesting an interpreter, but pleaded not guilty to the charge. A U.S. Coast Guard boarding team and the Coast Guard Investigative Service had boarded the ship, and according to court papers, the captain agreed to a sobriety test. Court papers said he was performing so poorly, the investigators stopped the test for his own safety. He later told investigators that he had not consumed alcohol in two months. He said the smell the pilot reported was “likely mouthwash” he used 10 minutes prior. However, he had agreed to the sobriety test and then a chemical breath test given by the Coast Guard, which showed 0.24 percent blood alcohol. He took two additional breath tests administered that same afternoon by the Washington State Patrol, and both registered 0.25 percent blood alcohol content. The Coast Guard imposed $1,000 civil penalty, and Danylin was charged and appeared before the judge on August 25. The arrest warrant was issued after he failed to attend a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
USCG Lifts Hatch Cover as It Investigates Baltimore Bulker Explosion,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uscg-lifts-hatch-cover-as-it-investigates-baltimore-bulker-explosion,,30/08/2025 00:21:35,,"The hatch cover that was blown overboard during the explosion on the bulker W-Sapphire was retrieved from the Baltimore shipping channel on Thursday, August 28. It is part of the ongoing investigation into the incident 10 days ago, on August 18, shortly after the vessel departed the coal terminal in Baltimore. The Fort McHenry Federal Channel leading into and out of the Port of Baltimore was closed to vessel traffic on Thursday from 0730 to 1500 local time. A 500-yard safety zone radius was established around the location of the hatch cover at the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay. Dive and salvage operations were undertaken. By mid-afternoon, the USCG posted that the 30-ton hatch had been successfully retrieved from the Patapsco River. The safety zone restriction was removed and the channel reopened. Army Corps surveying the harbor area after the explosion (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore District had assisted the USCG and deployed its survey vessel Buck to conduct sonar surveys around Baltimore's Fort McHenry Channel on August 19, the day after the explosion. Captain Jake Tuer, who conducted the survey, reported that the data collected during this process would help determine the operational plan moving forward, including reopening the channel that day and yesterday’s recovery. The 751-foot bulker W-Sapphire remains anchored in the channel near Sandy Point State Park and north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The ship had been escorted into the anchorage shortly after the explosion and will remain there while the USCG and state authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion. Initial radio calls from the vessel said there was possibly water intake into the hold, but the force of the explosion appears to have mostly been driven upward, breaking through the hatch cover. Bulker being escorted out of the channel after the explosion on August 18 (North Point - Edgemere Volunteer Fire Department) Investigators are looking into the cause of the explosion, which ripped the hatch cover off the vessel’s number 2 hold. One leaf remained on deck while the other went overboard. There was a massive fireball, which observers said went several hundred feet into the air, followed by a smoke plume. Coal dust explosions are typically a secondary result of another trigger and require a mix of fuel, heat, and oxygen with the dust suspended in the air. They are reported to be considering spontaneous combustion as well as an external source of heat or fire that contributed to the explosion.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
"Israel Responds to Turkish Trade Ban, Moves Tugboat Order to Bulgaria",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/israel-responds-to-turkish-trade-ban-moves-tugboat-order-to-bulgaria,,29/08/2025 22:49:16,,"The Israel Ports Company, which oversees the operations of the country’s ports, along with the Ministry of Transport, is reporting that they have moved an order for two advanced technology tugboats to a shipyard in Bulgaria in response to the actions of the Turkish government. According to the reports, the order was valued at $30 million and had previously been with an unnamed Turkish shipbuilder. News of the change came as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan confirmed in a speech to parliament today, August 29, the country’s new actions against Israel. As has been reported, Turkey is banning Israeli ships from its ports, ships transporting military cargo for Israel, and also, according to the minister, has closed its airspace. Turkish ships are also prohibited from calling at Israeli ports, expanding on a trade ban the government imposed last year. “Our decision to replace the Turkish shipyard with a friendly shipyard in Bulgaria is an expression of a clear policy,” said Miri Regev of the Minister of Transportation and Road Safety, according to a report in the Israeli news outlet Haipo. “We will not give in to boycotts, but will continue to ensure the strengthening of the ports, the continuity of service, and the independence of the State of Israel's operations.” The Haifa Maritime Transport Company signed the new contract with Bulgaria’s MTG Dolphin shipyard in Varna, Bulgaria. They will build two tugs to be delivered to the port by the end of 2026. ""The new tugboats are an integral part of our preparations for the coming years,” said Moshe Ben Zaken, Director General of the Ministry of Transportation. “We are working determinedly to provide Israel's ports with the most advanced technological tools to deal with the constant increase in the volume of maritime traffic."" The new tugs will be the most powerful yet deployed in Israel, with a pulling capacity of 85 tons. They will use Rotor tug technology. The plan calls for the new vessels to replace two of the four tugs currently operating in the Haifa port. Israel in April acquired for approximately $14.6 million a tug named Almog. The VECTOR model tug has a pulling capacity of 73 tons and is currently the most powerful in the country. It was deployed to the port of Ashdod and operates in the southern part of the country. Turkey has historically been a strong trading partner with Israel. It was exporting building materials such as iron, marble, steel, cement, aluminum, and bricks, as well as fertilizer and construction equipment to Israel. The Bank of Israel reported more than $5.3 billion in exports from Turkey to Israel in 2023 before the prior embargo. Even after the 2024 embargo, unofficial numbers show $100 to $200 million a month in Turkish goods arriving in Israel, according to a report in the Israeli newspaper Globes.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
DOT and MARAD Pull Nearly $700M in Port and Wind Terminal Grants,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/dot-and-marad-pull-nearly-700m-in-port-and-wind-terminal-grants,,29/08/2025 21:13:55,,"The efforts to detail the U.S. offshore wind power industry are continuing with the US Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration (MARAD) terminating and withdrawing nearly $700 million in grants made by the Biden administration for wind ports and terminals. In total, they identified 12 offshore wind grants and project selections in discretionary grant programs to be canceled. The press statement references “doomed offshore wind projects,” saying the funding will be prioritized toward restoring America’s maritime dominance. They report that DOT and MARAD are refocusing on “rebuilding America’s shipbuilding capacity, unleashing more reliable, traditional forms of energy, and utilizing the nation’s bountiful natural resources.” DOT has withdrawn one project from the Nationally Significant Freight and Highways Projects program, saving they report roughly $427 million. MARAD has withdrawn six projects, retracting $177 million, and terminated six projects in the Port Infrastructure Development Program, saving roughly $75 million. It totals $679 million in grants. “The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,"" said Liz Burdock, CEO of Oceantic Network, a nonprofit supporting offshore wind and ocean energy. ""Offshore wind port development upgrades facilities and capabilities that serve multiple industries; however, by selectively limiting infrastructure investments and removing mandated agreements in energy and shipyards, the administration is stalling essential development that delivers on shared priorities of national security and energy dominance, and signals to the investment community the U.S. is not safe place for investment."" The largest project included in the list is California’s Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind, which loses roughly $427 million in grants. The list also includes major wind projects including the Salem Wind Port in Massachusetts which was terminated at a saving of roughly $33.8 million, the Norfolk (Virginia) Offshore Wind Logistics Port ($39 million), Sparrows Point (Maryland) Steel Marshalling Port ($47 million), New Jersey’s Wind Port at Paulsboro ($20 million), Arthur Kill (New York) Terminal ($48 million) and the Redwood (California) Marine Terminal ($8.7 million). It also includes $10.5 million for the Bridgeport Port Authority (Connecticut) for the Operations and Maintenance Wind Port Project. The Port of Davisville (Rhode Island) loses $11.25 million. The Lake Erie Renewable energy project ($11 million), Radio Island Rail Improvements (North Carolina) loses $1.7 million, and Portsmouth Marine Terminal (Virginia) loses $20 million. The statement says that, where possible, funding from these projects will be ""recompeted"" to address critical port upgrades and other core infrastructure needs of the United States. “Wasteful wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. “Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry.” The accusations from Duffy and the Trump administration ignore the extensive investments made by the offshore wind industry into shipbuilding and the revitalization of ports such as Salem, Bridgeport, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. In 2023, President Joe Biden highlighted that companies had announced 18 offshore wind shipbuilding projects as well as investments of nearly $3.5 billion across 12 manufacturing facilities and 13 ports to strengthen the American offshore wind supply chain. The vessels ranged from the first Jones Act-compliant installation vessels to SOVs and crew transfer vessels. They were being built at shipyards ranging from Florida to Louisiana, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Many of the projects went to smaller shipyards to build crew transfer vessels. Among the large projects were SOVs built by Edison Chouest Offshore in Louisiana and Fincantieri Bay in Wisconsin. Seatrium AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas, is completing the massive turbine installation vessel Charybdis, the first of its kind in the United States, for Dominion, and Hanwha Philly Shipyard recently floated a rock installation vessel being built for Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Pirates Scared Off from Tanker Attack by Approaching Patrol Boats,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/pirates-scared-off-from-tanker-attack-by-approaching-togolese-patrol-boat,,29/08/2025 19:43:40,,"The suspected attack on a small chemical tanker off the coast of Togo in West Africa is over, with the crew reported to be safe and AIS signals showing the vessel underway. The incident took place approximately 60 nautical miles south of Lome, Togo, but details remain unclear. The joint French–British monitoring operation Maritime Domain Awareness for Trade – Gulf of Guinea (MDAT-GoG) records the incident as concluded and lists it as a small vessel coming in close proximity to the tanker, which has been identified in other reports as the Endo Ponete (7,250 dwt) registered in Malta. Maritime risk consultancy Vanguard Tech reports that a vessel had been attacked and termed it an attempted boarding, while Ambrey called it a boarding incident. The vessel was getting underway from Togo and southbound for the Democratic Republic of Congo when the small boat approached. Vanguard reports the captain ordered the crew to muster and enter the citadel, and they notified the local authorities. A Togolese patrol boat was dispatched, and according to the reports, the pirates fled when they saw the approaching naval support. In addition, the Nigerian Maritime Administration (NIMASA) and the Nigerian Navy were also coordinating and dispatched an additional boat to assist the tanker. The tanker was searched, and the crew was released from the citadel. There are no reports of damage, but it is unclear if the vessel was boarded. Built in 2010, the tanker, which is 95 meters (312 feet) in length, is reported to have been operating in the region since being acquired by Endo Tankers in June 2023. It previously operated as the Mandume, registered in the Marshall Islands. Product tankers have emerged as a favored target of the pirates in the region. In April, a product tanker was boarded and robbed while off the Nigerian coast, and in the past, product tankers have been robbed of fuel in the region near Cote d’Ivoire. In March, a product tanker was robbed and crewmembers kidnapped further south off the Central African coast. MDAT-GoG reports this is the first incident in the region in at least 90 days. It reported a rash of incidents in the March and April timeframe, but overall, serious crime against merchant ships has been dramatically reduced after peaking in 2020 in the Gulf of Guinea region.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02

"UK, France and Germany Trigger UN ""Snapback"" Sanctions on Iran",https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/uk-france-and-germany-trigger-un-snapback-sanctions-on-iran,,29/08/2025 06:00:05,,"The UK, Germany and France have followed in the footsteps of U.S. regulators and have reimposed ""snapback"" sanctions on Iran over its nuclear weapons program. The decision amounts to an end of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), the 2015 multilateral agreement that is known in the U.S. as the ""Iran nuclear deal."" The UN Security Council unanimously approved the JCPOA, and international monitors found that for the next three years, Iran appeared to keep to the letter of the deal on uranium enrichment and nuclear R&D. However, its other military activities continued unabated, creating an ongoing and urgent concern for Iran's critics and neighbors. Though not nuclear per se, these activities - specifically Iran's accumulating missile stockpile, its involvement in civil wars in Syria and Yemen, and its provision of training and support for anti-American militias - had serious strategic implications. In May 2018, the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed sanctions on Iran, initiating a campaign of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran's economically-vital petroleum sector. One year later, Iran began breaching the terms of the agreement on enriched uranium and centrifuges, and it restricted international monitors' access to its nuclear sites. The UK, France and Germany tried to mediate, but did not immediately exit the deal. ""We acted in good faith to preserve the JCPoA, in the sincere hope of finding a way to resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue, while preserving the agreement and remaining within its framework,"" the three European nations (together, the E3) said in a joint statement. In July 2025, in a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, the E3 proposed to extend its terms if Iran would meet several criteria, beginning with inspections and resumption of negotiations. Iran did not agree, and the E3 concluded that ""Iran's non-compliance with the JCPoA is clear and deliberate."" The E3 have decided to notify the UN Security Council that Iran is not following its commitments under the deal, activating the ""snapback"" mechanism that reimposes UN sanctions. ""If the UNSC does not adopt within 30 days a resolution to continue the lifting of UNSC resolutions on Iran, six Security Council resolutions, including on sanctions, will be restored,"" the E3 noted. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the announcement and said that it was a prelude to renewed negotiations. In a statement, Rubio said that ""snapback does not contradict our earnest readiness for diplomacy, it only enhances it."" The UN sanctions that are set to enter into renewed effect will reimpose an arms embargo, an overseas asset freeze, a travel ban, limits on ballistic missile programs, and restrictions on nuclear technology. These limits could reinforce the economic effects of the U.S. government's unilateral ""maximum pressure"" sanctions regime. Iran's currency, the rial, fell abruptly after the E3's announcement, reflecting market expectations of additional economic pressure. In a statement Thursday, the Iranian government called the E3's actions a ""provocative and unnecessary escalation,"" and pledged to respond. ""Iran has acted responsibly and in good faith in adhering to diplomacy for resolving nuclear-related issues,"" asserted Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a statement. The current status of its nuclear program is opaque, as UN experts have been banned from its sites, and Iran denies that it has intentions of producing a nuclear bomb. But as of May - before a series of Israeli and American airstrikes - it was believed to possess enough high-enriched uranium to produce nine nuclear weapons. To achieve a nuclear breakout, Iran would still need to develop a working weapon design, and would have to process its uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal for fabrication.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02
Nord Stream Suspect Also Under Investigation for Tanker Attack in Italy,https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/nord-stream-suspect-also-under-investigation-for-tanker-attack-in-italy,,29/08/2025 04:14:25,,"The Ukrainian military veteran arrested last week in connection with the Nord Stream pipeline attack is also under investigation for involvement in the blast that hit the tanker Seajewel, according to Italian media reports. Serhii Kuzientsov, an ex-Ukrainian special forces soldier, was detained in the Italian resort town of Rimini last week by the Carabinieri. He has an outstanding warrant in Germany for involvement in the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream pipeline system, which badly damaged three out of the four Russian gas lines under the Baltic. According to Corriere della Sera, Kuzientsov had driven to Rimini in a car with Ukrainian plates, accompanied by his family, and had registered for lodging under his own name - hardly attempting to evade detection. Kuzientsov faces extradition to Germany to stand trial for charges related to the Nord Stream attack, and he is fighting that process in court. At a hearing on Monday, he told the Bologna Court of Appeal that he was in Ukraine at the time of the Nord Stream attack, and denied any knowledge of it. He is in detention while the legal process moves forward, according to Corriere de Bologna - but there is a possibility that he could also be charged in Italy for a separate incident. Prosecutors in Genoa have been conducting a terrorism investigation in connection with the attack on a crude oil tanker at Savona in February, and have previously told local media that they suspect a Ukrainian nexus. The vessel, Seajewel, is one of seven tankers that were hit by mysterious explosions in the first half of the year. All previously carried Russian cargoes, prompting speculation over possible Ukrainian involvement; Ukraine has invested significant resources in attacking the Russian energy industry, which is the financial foundation of the ongoing invasion. The Genoa investigation is looking into Kuzientsov's potential involvement in the attack on the Seajewel, according to Corriere della Sera. That inquiry is ongoing, and could lead to additional charges of wrecking a vessel with an aggravating factor of terrorist intent. Other arrests could be coming: German authorities have identified five more suspected accomplices in connection with the Nord Stream attacks, and have filed at least one other outstanding warrant.",Maritime Executive,30/08/2025 09:27:02

Damen Launches latest Island Class for BC Ferries,https://maritime-executive.com/article/damen-launches-latest-island-class-for-bc-ferries,,31/08/2025 04:03:58,,"[By: Damen Shipyards] On 27 August, Damen Shipyards Group launched the latest Island Class ferry for Canada’s BC Ferries. The vessel is the second of four Island Class vessels currently under construction at Damen Shipyards Galati in Romania. Once operational, the ferries will provide low emission services connecting coastal communities along the coast of British Columbia. Forward steps When delivered, the ferry will be the eighth Island Class vessel that Damen has built for BC Ferries. The Island Class is based on the design of the Damen 8117 Electric Ferry (E3). The Galati shipyard has seen a lot of activity on all four Island Class vessels under construction over the past few weeks. In early July, the yard also marked the grand block assembly of the ninth vessel, and the keel laying of the tenth, on the same day. These ferries will transport passengers between Nanaimo and Gabriola Island, and Campbell River and Quadra Island. Damen is outfitting the vessels with diesel-electric hybrid propulsion. In the future, once the relevant electrical infrastructure is in place, BC Ferries intends to operate the ferries on 100% electric power. Long-term collaboration Damen Executive Director Global Sales Leo Postma said, “There’s been a lot of movement on the various Island Class vessels over the past few months and it’s very exciting for our team to see progress unfolding at such a rate. We continue to enjoy an excellent cooperation with BC Ferries. We are very grateful for the quality of this relationship, which is undoubtedly a significant factor in the ongoing success of the project.” Damen is also supplying BC Ferries with onshore charging equipment and will, via its BC-based Service Hub, continue to provide its client with support during the vessels’ operational phase. A new generation In a further step forward for sustainable public transport operations, the four Island Class vessels currently undergoing construction are being modified to reduce underwater radiated noise. Together, Damen and BC Ferries undertook a series of underwater noise measurements on the Island Class vessels already in operation. Damen, working with its suppliers, has put the findings from these measurements into reducing underwater radiated noise in this next generation of Island Class vessels. This is in line with BC Ferries’ Long Term Underwater Management Plan. The company has developed this Management Plan minimise impacts on marine life in the areas in which it operates, most notably the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale. Measures taken include hull drag reduction via towing tank testing after a number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Additionally, the adaptations were made to the vessels’ propulsion system including a new quieter and more efficient propeller blade design.

""It is more important today than any time in our history that we have the capacity and skills to not only be competitive with other countries, but to far exceed them,” said Senator Jack Reed (RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Reed called on the defense industry leaders in attendance to continue to advance American innovation and security. “What you do ultimately ensures the safety and security of our men and women in uniform across the world. This is a common purpose we share.” Distinguished speakers at the 11th annual sold-out event represented decades of experience across Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and private sector service, including RDML Peter Small, Chief Engineer and Commander of NAVSEA Warfare Centers; Dr. Andrew Erickson, Naval War College China Maritime Studies Institute; Dr. Michael Winter, Chief Scientist, RTX; COL David Brown (ret.), Naval War College Center for Irregular Warfare and Armed Groups; LtGen Eric E. Austin, Deputy Commander, Combat Development and Integration, US Marine Corps Combat Development Command, and BG Chris Hackler, Deputy Commanding General, US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command. Panels included “Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet” and “Mastering the Depths: Navigating the Engineering Battlespace.” Key takeaways from this year’s event are: “More than a decade after we hosted the first Defense Innovation Days, SENEDIA continues to see the critical need to bring together industry and government, civilian and military leaders to connect, collaborate with one another, and ultimately innovate in service of our national security,” said Molly Donohue Magee, Chief Executive Officer of SENEDIA. “Investing in defense is an economic, workforce, and national security imperative.” More from Defense Innovation Days An Increasingly Challenging and Complex Environment Rapid advancements in technology have made internal research and development processes more challenging and increased external and geopolitical pressures have likewise made the warfighting landscape more complex. A rise in authoritarianism around the globe represents a threat to American democracy – including from China. Returning to Defense Innovation Days, Dr. Erickson provided a deep dive into changes in the Chinese military. He said that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has removed large numbers of military, defense, and political officials, but warned that it does not signal a slowdown. To the contrary, Erickson called it “the most dramatic military build-up since World War II.” “China’s military capabilities development and operational readiness are clearly advancing rapidly across the board,” he said. “The speed and scope are breathtaking. That is what needs to inform our dedication, our sense of purpose, and the missions to which we are directed.” Several speakers noted the importance of the workforce to maintain American dominance. “The Navy faces an urgent imperative to increase our capabilities, and our people are our biggest asset,” said RDML Small. “It's not just the trades we need to strengthen. We need to rebuild the national maritime engineering workforce. A tremendous national effort to rebuild this workforce is underway.” The Unmanned and Undersea Advantage The United States submarine program is widely viewed as the greatest deterrent to American adversaries, and two panel discussions focused on undersea challenges and opportunities in an ever-changing maritime landscape. Several speakers used the ongoing conflict in the Black Sea as an illustration of how maritime strategy is changing, where Ukraine has used naval drones to stave off a strong Russian Navy. The Mastering the Depths panel was moderated by Marie Bussiere, the Technical Director of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport. She was joined on the stage by NUWC colleagues Mark Vacarro, Director of the Subsea and Seabed Warfare SSTM; Steve Plunkett, Next Generation Weapons and Defensive Systems SSTM; Steve Lamb, Chief of the Contracting Office, and CDR Shawn Stelzel of the Undersea Warfighting Development Center. Collectively, they urged industry leaders – especially those who have yet to engage with NUWC – to consider delivering their best-in-class tools and technology for defense applications. “To maintain the undersea advantage, we need to get solutions into the hands of the fleet faster,” Bussiere said. On the Future of the Surface Navy and Hybrid Fleet panel, CAPT Colin Corridan (ret.), the former leader of Task Force 59, the Navy’s first maritime robotics and AI task force, moderated a panel that included Commander David Brannighan, Royal Navy, British Defence Staff USA, and Austin Gray, Co-Founder and CSO, Blue Water Autonomy. One takeaway of the panel included a charge to industry to apply their solutions to national security and help ensure a high-low procurement strategy that is diversified between advanced yet expensive high-end systems and cheaper, more flexible low-end systems. Moving at the Speed of Technology Across all three days, multiple speakers talked about the need to move faster – from harnessing AI and new technology to developing and quickly scaling new capabilities – to ensure our warfighters have the systems and tools they need when they need them. Just as undersea technology has changed the maritime landscape, COL Brown (ret.) pointed to drones as a comparable example of how airpower has been democratized. Beyond weapons, he also warned about disinformation as a weapon of war and how increasingly convincing deepfakes are making it difficult for military leaders and civilians alike to distinguish the truth. “We are entering an era of breathtaking technological advancement,” he said. “The warning of history is clear: Unless we adapt, the upheavals of the last century may pale in comparison to what lies ahead.” LtGen Austin and BG Hackler agreed on the importance of government and industry collaboration. Speed to execution must consider future changes in technology. Dr. Winter shared that RTX has introduced a new military engine nearly every decade over the last century. Looking forward, RTX and other Primes – as well as the supply chain companies that support them – must bring together the digital thread, relying on model-based systems engineering that allows for greater efficiency and responsiveness. “It is critical that we build these tools with enough longevity and enough forethought,” he said.

Bringing Command and Accountability Back to Surface Fleet Maintenance,https://maritime-executive.com/article/bringing-command-and-accountability-back-to-surface-fleet-maintenance,,01/09/2025 03:40:34,,"There are times when “the way things are” are no longer acceptable. Radical change, with incremental and careful execution, is urgently needed within the US Navy’s Surface Ship Repair Maintenance enterprise to rectify the shortcomings of two decades of well-intentioned initiatives that rendered a majority of Surface ships neglected and ill-equipped for combat. The problem is not wholly maintenance related – the contributing issues came about as an aggregate result of the Navy’s increased operational tempo since the start of the Global War on Terror, changes in Surface Force manning models, and disputes with Congress over the decommissioning of certain classes of ships, among other things. Recent operations in the Red Sea today are eerily reminiscent of the world in 2002 when we stretched the Navy thin to answer the nation’s call – and paid a price for decades. A recent GAO report highlighted the impact of manning shortages to ship crew’s ability to perform corrective maintenance; over 75 percent of Executive Officers stated that it was “difficult or very difficult” to complete required corrective maintenance. To address the lack of sustained success, and avoid the missteps of the past, the Surface Force and NAVSEA should employ a multi-tiered approach primarily centered on retaking control of shipboard maintenance to get us fair in the channel again. 2002-2010: MSMO and Management Failure The story begins with the war in the Middle East in 2003. For the first time in decades, the Navy’s answer to the nation’s call to action, pushed the fleet forward, and kept it there, using its Tomahawks and Marines to enable an immensely successful land campaign. It was not by coincidence that the president chose an aircraft carrier as a platform to announce “Mission Accomplished.” The cost of that prolonged surge, however, was the deferral of a mountain of maintenance that had been scheduled for the ships and then canceled. The Navy needed to invent a way to get those ships back in service quickly and efficiently. Working with industry, the Navy developed a plan that would leverage the strengths of certain shipyards for certain types of maintenance and provide stability for the workforce by bundling multiple ships of the same class together with the idea that this would result in money savings and efficiencies in the process. This plan, called MSMO (Multi-Ship-Multi-Option) plan was implemented in the early 2000’s. As envisioned, this plan was a good idea, however naval officers know very little about the business world. There was an implicit assumption in the execution of the MSMO plan that the Navy would save money by encouraging the industry to voluntarily decrease their bottom line. Read that again. It was never going to happen, and it didn’t happen. As a contractor following my retirement, I learned that ship repair business is just that – a business. Right or wrong, income is predicated on the Navy spending money to fix ships – any significant efficiencies in that process result in less money spent, and thus less profit. Less profit makes stockholders unhappy and drives businesses out of business. At the same time, the Navy decided to save manpower dollars for other programs such as the Optimal Manning and Top Six Rolldown initiatives, which reduced shipboard manning and mandated the dissolution of the Ships Intermediate Maintenance Activities (SIMAs), which had been around since the early 1980s. In fact, the GAO reports that the backlog of incomplete maintenance exceeded any savings from manpower cuts that were instituted as part of Optimal Manning and other reductions in shipboard manning. The SIMA dissolution was especially problematic since SIMAs were primarily designed to be focused on two things: leveraging Sailors on shore duty to conduct relatively minor and mid-level repairs using the expertise gained at sea and training shipboard Sailors in their technical rating. The elimination of SIMAs had a second impact: it meant all work had to go to contractors at a much higher price. While it may be true that the cost of SIMA was higher than the projected cost of giving the work to private industry – SIMA was cheaper only if you did not consider the actual cost of SIMA, e.g. salaries, facilities, etc., the Sailor cost was already spent, and the training and experience of working on equipment in-rate on shore duty is difficult to put a price tag on. An additional phenomenon I observed was that the cadre of government planners who performed availability and maintenance planning and preparations were released and hired by contractors as this process moved to industry under the Multi Ship Multi Option (MSMO) strategy. This did not change the net number of personnel in this area, but it made the cost and scope of those with this skill set a bit more difficult to track and quantify, and may have added a cost to the process as well. In parallel, the Navy drastically reduced the footprint of an organization called Supervisor of Shipbuilding, who was basically the “overseer” designed to hold the ship builders and ship maintainers honest and uphold standards. Around this timeframe (roughly 2007-2010), another dynamic came and went: Ship Class Squadrons, or CLASSRONs. Modeled after the Naval Aviation Enterprise, these groups were formed around each ship class and were given control of maintenance funding, acquisition processes, and current readiness. Led by sequential major commanders with experience in a specific ship class, they consolidated processes, lessons learned, assessments, and maintenance under one individual – wearing a command pin. They also tracked Class Advisories and major modifications across a focused subset of ships. As a cruiser commanding officer, I (Cordle) was overwhelmingly satisfied with the support received by the class advocate. In my specific case, the Cruiser CLASSRON Commander had held my job before, and therefore understood it. The CLASSRON Commander had the time and bandwidth to deal with roughly 20 ships compared with the current model where one Engineering Duty Officer Captain has to process all of the maintenance information associated with over 100 ships on each coast. The CLASSRON initiative was not given enough “bake time” and would have likely produced significant dividends if left in place. This occurred in 2012 with the justification that it created a parallel C2 process and muddied the waters with respect to funding. In an effort to improve oversight, Commander Navy Regional Maintenance Center, (CNRMC), was established in 2010 to standardize and oversee the Regional Maintenance Centers, whose processes were perceived to have drifted over the years. The goal was to place a flag officer on the waterfront with the supporting staff to police the maintenance process. While initially successful, the center of gravity of that organization has shifted to Washington and away from the waterfront. And in another manning decision, the Navy combined two flag positions, one for ship maintenance and one for modernization, placing arguably the two most complex functions in the Navy enterprise on the shoulders of one junior Flag officer. From this author’s experience, this task is too great for one individual, no matter how Herculean his or her efforts could be – they will always be pulled in two directions – one toward, and one away from the waterfront. 2011-2014: The Trends Worsen In the early 2010s, the VADM Balisle report and subsequent GAO findings were released, indicating a dangerous trend of neglect within the Surface Force. As a result, the Navy looked to reverse course in Sailor maintenance, manpower/manning models, and Officer training – albeit this was a slow change. As an outcrop of these reports and the associated action items, the Navy implemented the Surface Engineering Maintenance Planning Project, SURFMEPP, designed to focus on life cycle maintenance, act as the “conscience of the Navy” to get ships to expected service life, which has been extended several times from 35 to 45 years over the same period. With 2013 entered sequestration, government shutdowns, and funding shortfalls across the enterprise. During my time (Cordle) on active duty, I sat at the front table of Naval Surface Forces Atlantic time and again and signed documents that cut significant lifecycle maintenance from Surface ship availabilities because the money was not available. To be sure, the confluence of these factors did make the MSMO more efficient, more flexible, and able to maximize the work completed, but it did not save money. The other unfortunate side effect was that a lack of rigor and uniformed oversight on the Navy side allowed companies to take advantage of the situation thereby increasing profits, although they arguably used much of the extra income to reinvest and try to grow, train, and pay their workforce in a standard capitalist model (that we laud in most other applications) – but with the Navy as their only paying customer. In the end, industry conducted themselves like any capitalist business that has to make money to stay viable. It is worth noting as background perhaps, but even before sequestration the lack of stability in the funding lines created considerable volatility in the repair community even under MSMO – the long-standing practice of underfunding surface ship maintenance and then using mid-year plus ups to close the gap to meet requirements generates its own uncertainty every fiscal year, as I experienced in my short tenure as a Type Commander Maintenance Officer in 2011 (Cordle). Thus, the MSMO financing vehicle coupled with the elimination of SIMAs, which was initially hailed as a process designed to get the most work done (albeit at a premium price), fell victim to economics, in that the expected savings never materialized. As a result, in the decade that was the 2005 to 2015, the Surface Navy gave away its ability to fix itself and took out title loans on its ships in the form of a maintenance backlog to the tune of billions of dollars. Add to this the compounding “interest” of fewer Sailors with less training conducting shipboard self-evaluation, and you get the expected result: a rather large volume of unaddressed maintenance discrepancies aboard ships. 2015-2020:Replacing MSMO with MACMO About halfway through this journey, in the 2010s after one or two complete change outs of the key leaders who brought MSMO to the table, a new narrative developed: civilian contractors are making too much money and keeping the ships longer to increase their bottom line. Unfortunately, rather than conduct a holistic self-analysis of the system, the Navy abruptly scrapped the MSMO concept in favor of a firm-fixed price, restrictive process that allowed a relatively small set of contractors to bid on large availabilities individually and called it another name bathed in obfuscation: the Multi Award Contract Multi Option, or MACMO, process. Designed to cure the ills of the MSMO process by driving competition and accountability into the system, this was another good idea, but as Admiral (ret) Jesse Wilson once said, “whenever you create a new process you create new problems”. Since this was a fairly classic “top down” initiative, there was not much of an appetite for pushback or critique and not much time to shift the processes to support it. Several established and complex processes were taken on by the government, including the purchasing of long lead time materials and the complex and detailed planning process, without a robust experience base or training program in place to support it. The learning curve for this change was a steep one, and the Navy paid a price in planning and material delays during the transition to this new process. A 2017 GAO report captured the precise cost of these manning decisions, in terms of unexecuted maintenance, in billions of dollars and millions of man-days. The graphs are eye-popping and relevant even today. Manpower Savings were more than offset by increased maintenance costs (Source: GAO) Now came some interesting system dynamics that while predicted, created a new set of issues when juxtaposed against the changes previously mentioned. First, the Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers (DDGs) and the Harpers Ferry-class Landing Ship, Dock ships (LSDs) entered their midlife periods, forcing maintenance availabilities to extend beyond the previous 3 to 5-month durations into durations of 12-18 months. This length change required more planning, more parts, and a larger, better trained workforce in industry, all of which were sub-optimized by the transition to MACMO. Secondly, the Navy also revived the Coast Wide Bid process that surprised many when it actually happened to USS RAMAGE and again to USS SHOUP a few years later. Navy Manpower and manning management processes in both the active duty and civilian side are not aligned to support such endeavors. Thirdly, Congress and the Navy treated the Cruisers and LSDs as chips in a game of poker, alternately placing them on decommissioning lists, cutting their funding to near zero, laying them up, and then trying to bring them back after a bluff has been called. This resulted in huge sunk costs, delays in critical repairs, not to mention the impact on manning and morale of crews that were “strung along” for years in a decommissioning mindset. Like trying to restore the old Ford truck that one would find in their grandfather’s pasture, this effort has grown in cost and magnitude far beyond original estimates, sucking money away from other endeavors. Delays in designing a replacement for these capital ships, which are pretty awesome warfighters, have resulted in their being kept around, with the quandary that no capital ship is as capable, nor as expensive to maintain, as our aged cruisers. 2020-Present: The Consequences A 2020 GAO report found that “since shifting to the Multiple Award Contract-Multi Order (MACMO) contracting approach for ship maintenance work in 2015, the Navy has increased competition opportunities, gained flexibility to ensure quality of work, and limited cost growth, but schedule delays persist. During this period, 21 of 41 ship maintenance periods, called availabilities, for major repair work cost less than initially estimated, and average cost growth across the 41 availabilities was 5 percent. Schedule outcomes were less positive, and Navy regional maintenance centers varied in their performance.2 This is shown in the graph below: Schedule delays under MAC-MO Contracting (Source: GAO) Admiral Galinis, who later commanded NAVSEA as a 3-star, when asked at a 2015 Fleet Maintenance Seminar what changes the MACMO would bring around, he said “two things we will lose are flexibility and teamwork.” In retrospect, he was correct. Unfortunately, they were lost at a time when they were much needed. Another ingredient added to this complex system of setbacks was the ramp up of operational employment based on growing threats in the Pacific and in the Arabian Gulf. This resulted in policies of maintenance deferral and reduced certification requirements, all well documented in the Comprehensive Review of 2017. Righting the Ship In a 2019 article, David Larter described Navy Maintenance as a “dumpster fire.” While we do not fully agree with this dark assessment, it is definitely in need of a good overhaul. Surface Navy leaders have taken some action to help put us in a good place, including: 1. Surface Type Commanders have established a Post-Major Command Surface Warfare O-6 billet to oversee all aspects of the maintenance domain. This brings experience, oversight, and seniority to the process and is starting to pay dividends. 2. Establishment of Surface Readiness Groups – this initiative (which is not new) theoretically restores the positive attributes found in CLASSRONs. Under the Surface Readiness Group model, all ships in the Maintenance Phase are aligned under one Commodore per homeport, allowing a singular focus on maintenance and freeing up the deployed Commodores to focus on warfighting. These are great steps to remedy the problems. Imagine if a Ford F-150 production line had to deal with a change to baseline of about 30 percent – this would be a flawed business model. Yet, this is what we ask the maintenance community to deal with every time a ship enters a yard period. To address this dilemma, the Surface Force needs to improve its scope of work planning for upcoming surface availabilities. Additionally, there should be more margin built into the schedule and price of each availability. Availabilities should start with a measure of float built in, and the Surface Force should resist the urge to plan against this float. Further, the Surface Force should acknowledge that there will be increases to scope and new work, instead of ignoring it or pretending it will not manifest. By leveraging options, frontloads, class maintenance plans, and flexible contracting, it must be possible to fund and plan for both long-term maintenance and current repairs. Things on a ship break all the time, and the process needs to be proactive vice reactive. Additionally, the Navy should consider the following measures: 1. Treat this like the crisis that it is. Assemble a team of the most experienced people and challenge them to come up with a plan but force them to take off their functional “armor” (acquisition, modernization, maintenance, contracting, etc.) to collaborate on a new plan that is innovative, integrated, and responsible. This team should be challenged to openly discuss the best and worst parts of each model from MSMO to MACMO, Firm Fixed Price and Cost-Plus contracts. The narrative that “the utterance of the word MSMO will result in career suicide” is not helpful here. 2. Restore SIMA as a separate command. SIMAs are currently resident within Code 900 at the Regional Maintenance Centers. This construct sub optimizes SIMA’s visibility, employment, and effectiveness. Command is command; and putting a Shore Command Pin on the Commander of Ship Intermediate Maintenance would open additional command opportunities to the Engineering Duty Officer community – and consequently be good for the ships and Sailors. 3. Empower the local shipyard. Currently a Shipyard Commander has relatively no tools or levers to punish or incentivize a lead maintenance activity during a Shipyard availability. For instance, if an LMA neglects to conduct a repair within a prescribed timeline, or the work is not completed to the level of quality that it should, the shipyard has to spend exorbitant amounts of time, resources, and money to present an iron-clad case to fiscally punish the LMA. In many cases, it is more cost effective to not pursue punishment. Conversely, the Shipyard Commander has little to no way of rewarding a LMA who does a job well (on time and/or under budget). Consideration should be given to allowing the Shipyard Commander, with delegation to pertinent Project Managers, to fiscally reward or withhold a relatively small percentage of money at their level. The shipyard represents the “tactical ground commander” and observes many violations in Shipboard maintenance, and has very little ability to affect immediate change. 4. Fix the planning phase of major availabilities. On average, the amount of work during a major availability changes by roughly 30 percent after it begins. This corresponds to a range of 2,000 and 20,000 Requests for Contract Changes (RCCs) depending on the length of the maintenance period. One solution is a “Business Model Cost and Schedule” approach that was published in the Naval Engineer’s Journal in 2021. 5. Revive the good parts of the MSMO strategy to include focusing certain repair yards on certain classes of ships and providing bundled ship contracts over a period of years to allow consistency, gain some efficiencies, and train a workforce for the nation’s future. This approach does not have to be unitary in its contracting strategy but could include a more flexible pricing process described in #1 above. The contracting officers will have issues with this, but we cannot continue to build the maintenance process around the contracting process instead of around the Fleet. Many in the commercial industry have shared that a predictable and dependable income stream are critical to allowing industry to train the workforce and invest in infrastructure. 6. Leverage the goodness of processes like the Continuous Intermediate Availability (CIA) model conducted in Rota, Spain, which is similar to the old 13-week availabilities, where TYCOM-level maintenance is accomplished in short, focused maintenance periods. This could be folded into the OFRP, perhaps at the beginning of the Sustainment Phase right after deployment, and the ship return to service for a while before starting maintenance. To be sure, this initiative will have to be balanced against the need of the Operational Commander. 7. Split the Flag Officer billets for maintenance and modernization. There isn’t a single root cause for many of the current issues, nor is the problem with any particular individual. However, the move to put too many decisions on a single individual’s plate was a singularly bad move and needs to be fixed quickly. 8. Move the commander of CNRMC to Norfolk, and place a deputy in San Diego. The vision of CNRMC that was put in place by USFF in 2010 was to place a Flag Officer on the waterfront overseeing ship’s maintenance. That fundamental tenet has been lost but could be regained relatively simply. The new modernization Flag Officer can satiate the appetite in Washington for information, while their maintenance counterpart can get “boots on the ground” and start extracting ships from the yards with a crowbar instead of a 300-mile towing hawser. Of note, a similar move was just implemented with the creation of a Flag Officer billet to supervise the nuclear shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia. 9. Replicate the Supervisor of Shipbuilding model from the nuclear side at the regional maintenance centers. Empower them to provide oversight, accountability, and rigor to the ship repair process. Put teeth back into the process. Rewrite the NAVSEA Standard Item 009-060 to require contractors to provide a detailed, integrated plan that can be graphed, tracked and used to hold them to account. If there is one thing I hear over and over from Commanding Officers in the yards, it is “who is holding anyone accountable?” You can figure out the answer. No one. 10. Bring back a deployable ship repair capability to replace the Yellowstone Class Destroyer Tenders by installing a full machine repair capability (including Additive Manufacturing) into one Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) class ship in each theater. These multi-purpose platforms have lots of space and could probably support a modular solution as well. Manning could be surged from the Regional Maintenance Centers in time of need. This is not an argument to completely revert to the old way of doing things. This article is formulated from not just our own experiences, but multiple peers who (at least to some extent) feel the same way. One shared, “Firm Fixed Price is a great model for the commercial industry or Maritime Sealift Command, for basic maintenance on ships that are not all that complex; it is exactly the wrong model for complex warships that require expertise, flexibility, and integration – like Navy ships.” There were many sins (including some in which at least one of us was complicit), all well intentioned, and many unavoidable over the years. But by scrapping programs that used to work, and failing to look for another solution, we will all simply admire the problem as more and more of the Fleet is tied to the pier when it is needed most. Instead, the Surface Warfare Community needs to take control of its own destiny, help the Engineering Duty Officer community do its core job, assume responsibility for the maintenance of its ships, increase command opportunity, and inject rigor, decisiveness, and accountability into a system where these words have gone out of style. One key component of any strategy is to “take a fix.” The 2022 GAO report on maintenance backlog provides a stunning insight into the lack of accuracy and estimating the value of deferred maintenance. The amount provided to the GAO was literally off by a factor of 10 ($1.8 billion vs $180 million). This gap was then addressed by accelerating decommissioning of multiple ships which collectively represented about 80% of the gap. Unfortunately this approach addresses the immediate problem without addressing the root cause; its effect will be temporary and cannot be repeated. As today’s Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Readiness Groups engage in global combat operations unparalleled in modern history, with even less ships than we had during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the same forces at work in 2002 are starting to become evident, with deployments stretching to an average of over 220 days and no end in sight. Unless something changes, we are likely to find ourselves in the same position 10 years from now. Captain John Cordle, USN, retired from the Navy in 2013 after 30 years of service. He commanded the USS Oscar Austin (DDG-79) and USS San Jacinto (CG-56), earning a Bronze Star in 2003 and the U.S. Navy League’s Captain John Paul Jones Award for Inspirational Leadership in 2010. He is a Plankowner on CVN 75 and CVN 77, where he served as Reactor Officer. He received the SNA Literary Award in 2014 and 2019, as well as the 2019 ASNE Solberg Award and U. S. Naval Institute Author of the Year Award for his contributions to fatigue management in the United States Navy. In addition to serving as Chief of Staff for Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic (SURFLANT), he also served as a Program Manager for Maintenance University at Hunnington Ingalls Industries and as a GS 14 Human Factors Engineer at SURFLANT, where he was recognized with the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award. Now retired, he is focused on leveraging his life experience to help develop future leaders. Captain Holman Agard, USN, has a combined 27 years of service between the Enlisted and Officer ranks. He currently is serving as the Commanding Officer of USS SHOUP (DDG 86) and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Commander for the GEORGE WASHINGTON Carrier Strike Group (CSG-5) based in Yokosuka, Japan. Previously, he served in OPNAV N96 as the Destroyers Branch Head and Ships Deputy. He also was the Executive Officer and Commanding Officer in USS HOPPER (DDG 70). He has experienced extensive maintenance availabilities in all six ships he has been stationed on.

Appeals Court Rules That Most of Trump's Tariffs are Unlawful,https://maritime-executive.com/article/appeals-court-rules-that-most-of-trump-s-tariffs-are-unlawful,,01/09/2025 03:10:29,,"A federal appeals court has affirmed the lower court ruling that invalidated the Trump administration's sweeping nation-by-nation ""retaliatory"" tariffs. The court found that the levies do not have a legal basis under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the law that the administration has used to undergird most of its rapidly-shifting tariff announcements. IEEPA was enacted in 1977 to limit the president's power to impose punitive trade measures without Congress' involvement. The act allows the president to take certain trade actions during a declared emergency to respond to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to America's economy or national security. Powers enumerated under the act include blocking tranactions, freezing assets, and (in the event of an actual attack) confiscating property belonging to the threat. The statute limits each ""emergency"" to one year at a time, an attempt to curtail open-ended presidential decrees. It has been used by previous presidents on rare occasions, like sanctioning Al Qaeda, targeting the ayatollahs' regime in Iran, or limiting the finances of Colombian drug gangs. Trump used IEEPA extensively during his first term, and has begun to apply it in earnest since January 2025. Most of his administration's tariffs - including all of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on U.S. trading partners - rest on claims of authorities under IEEPA, but the administration has had difficulty defending these applications of the statute in court. In May, the Court of International Trade in New York found that Trump's retaliatory tariffs were not legally justified by IEEPA, but it stayed its decision pending appeal. The administration then took the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; on Friday, the court determined that IEEPA does not give the president any tariff powers (the word tariff does not appear in the text of the statute). Since Congress did not say that it would hand over its constitutional authority to levy tariffs when it wrote IEEPA, the court ruled, Congress did not delegate those powers to the president; though the White House does have other tariff authority under other statutes, the court found that it does not have tariff authority stemming from IEEPA. IEEPA ""neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the president's power to impose tariffs,"" the appeals court ruled. ""Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an overall structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs."" The appeals court stayed its ruling to give time for an appeal to the Supreme Court, which is highly likely. The court has responded favorably on most the administration's requests for emergency stays, and Trump held out hope that it would pause or overrule this court decision as well. ""Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians,"" President Trump wrote Friday in a social media post. ""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32
Pacific Island Nations are Divided Over Deep Sea Mining,https://maritime-executive.com/article/pacific-island-nations-are-divided-over-deep-sea-mining,,01/09/2025 00:34:59,,"[By Kolaia Raisele and Aidan Craney] In recent years, Pacific island nations have earned global credibility as champions of climate action. Pacific leaders view sea level rise as an existential threat. But this united front is now under strain as some Pacific nations pursue a controversial new industry – deep-sea mining. Nauru, the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Tonga have gone the furthest to make it a reality, attracted by new income streams. But nations such as Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu have called for a moratorium on deep-sea mining in international waters. Public opinion across the Pacific is often divided, pitting possible economic gains against the potential risks of an industry whose environmental impact remain uncertain but potentially significant. As this tension intensifies, it may split the Pacific and risk the region’s moral authority on climate. What are the concerns over deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining targets three types of mineral deposits – polymetallic nodules strewn across deep underwater plains, cobalt-rich crusts on seamounts, and the ore deposits around hydrothermal vents. To extract them, mining companies can use unmanned collectors to pump ore to the surface and return the wastewater. This creates plumes of sediment which can smother marine life. Methods of minimizing damage to species from mining on land are largely unworkable at depth. Deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood, but we know they are slow to recover. Researchers have found areas mined as a test more than 40 years ago still show physical damage and immobile corals and sponges remain scarce. Many species live on the seabeds, seamounts and hydrothermal vents which would be targeted for mining. Pictured: a crab crawling across a field of polymetallic nodules near Gosnold Seamount. NOAA, CC BY-NC-ND Why is there so much interest in deep-sea mining? Deep-sea mining hasn’t begun anywhere in earnest, because the International Seabed Authority has yet to finalize rules governing extraction. This authority oversees the 54% of the world’s oceans beyond territorial waters. But plans for deep-sea mining operations can still be submitted and considered without these rules in place. Analysts have estimated seabed minerals could be worth a staggering A$30 trillion. Some of the richest deposits lie in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in international waters between Hawaii and Mexico, thousands of kilometers away from Pacific nations. Under international law, companies cannot mine in international waters on their own. They need to be officially sponsored by a national government, which has to keep effective control over its operations. One reason deep-sea mining companies see Pacific states as such useful partners is that these countries can access reserved areas of international seabed set aside for developing countries, as well as potential resources in the very large territorial waters around many island states. Backers in Nauru, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Kiribati argue rising demand for manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel could deliver significant economic returns and diversify economies. Nauru’s enormous deposits of guano – compressed seabird excrement long sought as fertilizer – once made the country wealthy. But the guano is largely gone and the small nation has limited other resources. Nauru sponsors Nauru Ocean Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of seabed mining company The Metals Company. In 2011, the company received an International Seabed Authority contract permitting exploration of polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, more than 8,000km from Nauru. Nauru has since “proudly taken a leading role” in developing international legal frameworks in mining nodules in the international seabed. In June, Nauru signalled Nauru Ocean Resources would apply for an exploitation license. Tonga’s government is similarly backing deep-sea mining by partnering with The Metals Company to explore mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. In August 2025, Tonga signed an updated agreement with Tonga Offshore Mining, a subsidiary of The Metals Company. The agreement was originally signed in 2021 amid large-scale criticism over the lack of public consultation. The mining company has promised new benefits, ranging from financial benefits, scholarships and community programs. Even so, the revised deal has encountered opposition from civil society, young people and legal experts. Prominent Tongans remain unconvinced, citing environmental, legal and transparency risks. Economic pressure is part of the picture. Tonga owes an estimated $120 million to China’s Exim Bank – roughly a quarter of its annual GDP. Cook Islands The 15 Cook Islands are widely scattered, giving the government exclusive rights to almost two million square kilometers of ocean. The government has issued exploration licenses inside its Exclusive Economic Zone to three companies – Cook Islands Consortium, CIIC Seabed Resources Limited, and Moana Minerals. The Cook Islands government has established a domestic regulatory framework and is building research capacity. Kiribati’s atolls and island are even more dispersed. The nation’s exclusive economic zone covers about 3.4 million km2. The state-owned Marawa Research and Exploration company holds a 15-year exploration contract with the seabed authority. Kiribati has opened talks with China to explore potential collaboration. The Pacific split While revenues could potentially be sizeable for the Pacific, costs, technologies and environmental liabilities are highly uncertain. The experience of Papua New Guinea is a cautionary tale. In 2019, the PNG deep-sea mining venture Solwara-1 went into administration following intense community pushback. The fallout cost the government an estimated $184 million. The PNG government now opposes deep-sea mining in its territorial waters. Nautilus Mineral’s Solwara-1 deep-sea mining project in Papua New Guinea wound up in 2019. Pictured: the company’s three seabed mining vehicles. Credit Nautilus Minerals / handout image While deep-sea mining now has clear backers, other nations are far more wary. In 2022, Palau launched an alliance calling for a moratorium on mining in international waters. Early signatories included Fiji, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since then, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands have joined, as well as dozens of other countries. PNG has not yet joined. Opposition from these Pacific states is based on the precautionary principle, which favors caution when knowledge is limited and damage is possible. Pacific youth are among the most prominent opponents of deep-sea mining. The regional Pacific Blue Line coalition uniting civil society, faith groups, women’s organizations and youth networks has consistently called for a complete ban in the region. Young people have spoke out publicly in nations such as Tonga, where youth advocates criticized limited consultation and rallied against the plans, as well as the Cook Islands, where young people have demanded transparency. Reputation under a cloud? Pacific leaders have built a worldwide reputation for their principled climate diplomacy, from championing the 1.5°C goal to the major new advisory opinion on climate change issued by the world’s top court in response to a case instigated by students from the University of the South Pacific. If some Pacific leaders open the door fully to deep-sea mining, it risks undermining the region’s united front on environmental issues and threatens its credibility. The way this plays out will shape how the world hears the Pacific on climate and the oceans in the years ahead. Kolaia Raisele is a PhD Candidate in Anthropology, La Trobe University.

Norway Orders Five Anti-Submarine Frigates From UK for $13.5 Billion,https://maritime-executive.com/article/norway-orders-five-anti-submarine-frigates-from-uk-for-13-5-billion,,31/08/2025 21:21:46,,"Norway has selected the British Type 26 frigate built by BAE to meet a requirement for ‘at least’ five anti-submarine vessels. The announcement was made jointly by Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Jonas Store on August 31, and is valued for the UK at $13.5 billion. Ships for the Royal Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy are to be built to identical specifications, so that in future logistic chains can be unified, joint crew training conducted and crews exchanged between ships. The decision comes ahead of the announcement of a new UK-Norway defense agreement, and builds on a particularly close naval relationship dating from the Second World War and continued through the Cold War. Royal Marines train annually in Norway to defend the far northern region, which borders Russia, and the HMS Prince of Wales (R09) carrier strike group on its deployment to the Pacific has been supported by the Norwegian Nansen Class frigate HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F311) and the logistic vessel HNoMS Maud (A530). The primary task for the Norwegian Type 26s will be anti-submarine warfare. The weapons fits remain to be fixed, and will no doubt be adjusted for the ships destined for both navies to take into account the strength of Norwegian missile manufacturers such as Kongsberg. The frigates will have hangars to integrate an anti-submarine warfare helicopter into the ship’s surveillance and attack capability. BAE’s Type 26 won out against stiff competition from Naval Group’s FDI, Germany’s F-127 and the American Constellation Class. The Type 26 has also been ordered for domestic manufacture by Australia (six Hunter Class ships) and Canada (fifteen River Class ships).",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32
UK Denies the Royal Navy Cannot Meet Operational Tasking,https://maritime-executive.com/article/uk-denies-the-royal-navy-cannot-meet-operational-tasking,,31/08/2025 21:10:00,,"Information from multiple sources suggests that the Royal Navy is now unable to meet commitments in several important areas, contrary to UK Ministry of Defence insistence that it is continuing to meet its operational tasking. A pattern of over-reliance on allies for support in order to maintain basic operational capabilities is apparent in a number of areas. For political reasons the Ministry appears unwilling to acknowledge the difficulties. But the problems are now so widespread that the collapse in capability has become glaringly obvious, and all too embarrassing for friends and allies to mention. The state of affairs is primarily a responsibility of British governments over many years who have shrunk the defense budget and delayed shipbuilding decisions, such that vessels are going out of service before new ships are delivered. At the same time, insufficient numbers of ships are being built to meet operational tasking, and the situation is compounded by a crisis in recruitment and retention. The issues are affecting operational capability across the whole fleet, and are not restricted to discreet capability areas. In the Indo-Pacific, HMS Prince of Wales (R09) continues its long-range deployment. But the Royal Navy is only fielding two of its protective escorts, Type 45 destroyer HMS Dauntless (D33) and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond (F239), the others being provided by a changing cast of ships from Norway, Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. For half of its deployment, the Carrier Strike Group has relied on a Norwegian replenishment ship, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary being unable to field RFA Tidespring (A136) for the entire cruise. Meanwhile on deck, the carrier is only supporting two squadrons of F-35s, half the number it was designed to carry. Much smaller flattops, for example in the Italian Navy, carry similar numbers of aircraft. Of six Type 45 destroyers, only two are operational, with HMS Daring (D32) about to return to service after a refit lasting over 3,000 days. The eight remaining Type 23 frigates are 30 years old, kept operational only with great difficulty, amongst them HMS Lancaster (F229), rumored likely to be withdrawn from Bahrain this year without replacement. The Type 23s are being replaced by Type 26s, with HMS Glasgow due in service in 2028, and Type 31s, with HMS Venturer due in service by 2027. Even if there are no shipbuilding delays, in 2026 and 2027 the Royal Navy risks being down to less than five frigates, all of dubious serviceability. It is also possible that the Norwegian order for five Type 26 frigates announced on August 31 could delay delivery of some of the eight Type 26 frigates for the Royal Navy through the reallocation of production slots. Underwater, delays in ordering new nuclear ballistic missile submarines mean that the Vanguard Class boats are suffering prolonged unserviceability. The need to always have one ‘bomber’ at sea has meant that three-month deployments are frequently extended, in one case in 2023 to six months. Prolonged deployments generate a whole series of problems, such as crew mental health and retention issues, and inevitably systems on board either fail or scheduled maintenance is missed, risky events in nuclear submarines. The consequences of running the Vanguard boats well beyond their design life will persist until at least the early 2030s, when new Dreadnought Class submarines currently being built start coming into service. The situation with attack submarines is equally dire. The last Trafalgar Class submarine HMS Triumph (S93) was decommissioned in July. Of seven Astute Class submarines to be built, five are commissioned, but only one is believed to be operational, probably committed to protecting the on-station nuclear ballistic submarine at sea. None is available to counter the still-powerful Russian submarine force elsewhere, which probably explains why a recent Russian submarine alarm in the northern Norwegian Sea had to be covered at huge cost by P8 Poseidon aircraft instead. In support of the fleet at sea, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is suffering a manning crisis, and can probably only put four ships to sea. The only healthy component of the fleet appears to be the offshore patrol vessels of the River Class, five of which are deployed to maintain the historic Royal Navy global presence, albeit with their limited firepower. The vessels cover for the shortage of destroyers and frigates - but without any anti-aircraft or anti-submarine capability. Royal Thai Navy versions of the same River Class design have a 76mm gun and Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Omani versions have a 76mm gun and Exocet missiles, but the Royal Navy ships for cost reasons only have a 30mm Bushmaster cannon. For the next few years, until ships under construction come into service, Royal Navy planners will be praying that no operational emergencies arise - because so few ships are available to meet contingencies. It will be a struggle to maintain the underwater nuclear deterrent; there will be a single minesweeper in the Gulf to handle inevitable crises; issues generated by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine continue. But all the while, threats multiply and the seriousness of the lack of capability goes unrecognized.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 04:53:32

Freighter Hits Explosive Device off Odesa,https://maritime-executive.com/article/freighter-hits-explosive-device-off-odesa,,01/09/2025 06:03:36,,"A small freighter encountered an explosive device and suffered a blast in waters off the coast of Odesa, according to Ukrainian media. Ukraine's Black Sea shipping corridor is known for the risk of drifting explosive devices and occasional Russian attacks. Sea mines linked to the Ukraine conflict have been found as far away as Georgia, on the other side of the Black Sea. The navies of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey have removed countless mines from the water, but despite countermeasures, chance encounters still happen. In this case, the Belize-flagged freighter NS Pride was operating off Chornomorsk - just south of Odesa's harbor - when it struck an unidentified floating explosive device. The vessel was in ballast at the time of the casualty, and there were no injuries reported. ""The ship sustained minor damage and is currently being inspected. It is likely to continue its journey under its own power,"" Ukrainian Navy spokesman Dmitry Pletenchuck told local outlet Dumskaya. ""Unfortunately, due to the actions of the Russian invaders, a large number of explosive objects remain at sea. And in a constantly moving maritime environment, it is, of course, impossible to predict such incidents with 100% certainty."" Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi reports that it is possible that the object was the remains of a Russian-Iranian Shahed drone that had been shot down by Ukrainian forces. The other strong possibility is a drifting sea mine. NS Pride is an Albanian-owned, Belize-flagged coastal freighter of about 3,400 dwt. Built in 1988 and approaching her 40th year in service, the vessel has changed names eight times since 2001 and has a questionable inspection record. Her typical trading pattern alternates between Greece, Sicily and Tunisia; on this voyage, she departed from that pattern and made multiple stops in Turkey before heading further north to Odesa, hugging the coast to stay closer to Bulgaria and Romania, AIS data provided by Pole Star shows.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50
Study: Collapse of Key Atlantic Ocean Current May Begin As Early As 2060,https://maritime-executive.com/article/study-collapse-of-key-atlantic-ocean-current-may-begin-as-early-as-2060,,01/09/2025 05:41:11,,"In the past few years, there has been a growing body of research looking into the potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation(AMOC). It is the Atlantic branch of the global ocean current system, responsible for transporting warm ocean water to the north, where it sinks and returns as cold, deep water to the South Atlantic. This circulation helps control the Northwestern European climate. In fact, AMOC is part of the reason Northern Hemisphere is on average 1.40C warmer than the Southern Hemisphere. However, researchers have revealed rising risks for AMOC to reach a tipping point, especially as the global climate system changes. A key destabilizing factor for AMOC is changes in ocean salinity. Back in 1961, the U.S oceanographer Henry Stommel was among the first researchers to recognize how the Atlantic’s water salinity leads to AMOC tipping point. But as this research has progressed with time, there has been speculation about the role played by climate change. Last week, researchers from Utrecht University in Netherlands released a groundbreaking study on the nexus between climate change and AMOC collapse. While the researchers published an almost similar study last year, the new paper uses data from the latest climate models contained under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The recent IPCC report is based on data from CMIP6, which consists of climate models from various institutes around the world. Under CMIP6, some of the models have global warming projections beyond year 2100. This has provided a more granular approach in analyzing systems such as AMOC. Unfortunately, the findings are concerning. Although previous studies indicated that AMOC collapse before 2100 was unlikely, the new paper shows that the tipping point could begin as early as 2060. “The risk of a tipping point by 2100 is over 90% under a high-emission scenario and over 50% under an intermediate climate change scenario,” said René van Westen, co-author of the study. In this case, a tipping point is when deep convection in the northern Atlantic stops. One approach to the AMOC shut down is the ongoing loss of ice in the Arctic, which adds freshwater in the Atlantic, affecting the ocean salinity levels. “The study provides rough estimates but main point is - this is a risk I used to consider less than 10%, and given the devastating impacts lasting many centuries we really want this to be less than 1%,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, Professor at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, who was also part of the study team. A full shut down of AMOC would cause severe climate disruptions. Some studies have showed that if AMOC weakens, sea levels on the American northeast coastline would rise sharply. On the other side, cold air temperatures would expand to cover Iceland, Britain and Scandinavia, with unprecedented storms.",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50
German Seaports Eye Defense Funding to Build Infrastructure,https://maritime-executive.com/article/german-seaports-eye-defense-funding-to-build-infrastructure,,01/09/2025 03:12:25,,"As Europe ramps up funding for its defense, German ports want to see some of the new resources used to strengthen transport infrastructure against potential military attacks. In a recent letter to the German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, the Central Association of German Seaport Operators (ZDS) emphasized that ports form the first line of attack in a war scenario. In addition, ports are critical in military deployment. In an emergency, materials and soldiers of the German military and NATO partners would have to be moved through seaports. ZDS estimates that an initial $3.5 billion is needed to ready German ports for wartime emergencies. “We must prepare for this, even if we hope that it never comes to a real emergency. History has taught us this,” said ZDS. The funding should be part of the defense budget and utilized to secure vulnerable port areas and associated infrastructure. These include quay walls, cyber systems and railway facilities. ZDS recommended a dual-use approach for the funding, catering for both civilian and military needs. Germany’s defense budget is poised to more than double until 2029, from about $72 billion in 2025 to more than $177 billion in the next four years. Part of the funds are earmarked for expanding transport infrastructure, especially roads and railways that are already considered as militarily relevant. With the ZDS proposal, the funding would also be extended to ports. Some of Germany’s most important seaports by cargo throughput include Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Wilhelmshaven and Rostock. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Germany has responded by strengthening the capabilities of its military. This has meant defense preparations for potential Russian aggression. This week, German media carried reports that the federal government is finalizing a military railway system to support NATO’s eastern flank. The exercise includes mapping critical infrastructure sites that would be prioritized in case of an attack. Separately, ZDS has also been highlighting the aging port infrastructure in Germany. New climate regulations and shifts in global trade are putting pressure on the shipping industry to transform. Unfortunately, the financing availed to ports in Germany has been criticized as insufficient for any meaningful development, and ZDS says that the needs come to about $17 billion. Currently, the federal government pays the states around $45 million annually for seaports. However, there have been some milestones, with the federal government last month announcing $467 million in funding to ports. The investment will go into modernization and building infrastructure for green shipping. Top image: Carsten Steger / CC BY SA 4.0",Maritime Executive,01/09/2025 09:33:50
